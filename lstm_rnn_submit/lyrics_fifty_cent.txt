Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Chorus]
I change places, to prevent catchin' the cases
Races, in the faces, hall at you laces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this

[Verse 1]
The only thing hotter than my flow is the block (inhale and exhale)
That's why I left this snow biz, and got into show biz
Let's get this clear, it ain't on 'til I say it's on, (pause), it's on
I'm eatin', ya'll niggas fastin' like it's Rimadon
Bowlish way in Lebanon, know 50 the bomb
I be at the edge of the bar, sippin' a Don
I keep the bottle just in case, you never know when it's on
This worries bump, I can't go wrong, my team's too strong
You want war? I take you to war, now that my money long
Why you broke? cat's buy the by lines and fantasize
The way I'm spittin', put TV's in everything I'm sittin'
While I'm hot to death, I'm gonna say this to all you playa haters
Ya'll should hate the game, not the playas (c'mon)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I change places, to prevent catchin' the cases
Races, in the faces, hall at you laces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
(50 Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)

[Verse 2]
Everyday is bugged, niggas'll come to a club
To try to show you they a thug, instead of showing some love
Now, what you think you chump me, If I let you bump me
When I'm about to make a mill, faster than you make a G (haha)
I know I lie, it's a habit, I vow to clean the city like the mayor
And in the crack game, I'm a franchise player
Niggas be thinkin' I be out to lunch with mines
Then in crunch time, I start hittin' 'em hard with punch lines
You cats got to be sick, to think 50 can't spit
Better check my batting average, I always make hits
My flows leave these rap cats ketro (ketro), all across the metro (metro)
Plus I pack a cannon, up under my marple cannon
They fake, they look like money, but ain't worth half the cake
Have me runnin' from Jake, in a GS with bad brakes
They want to knock me take, for Christ sakes

[Chorus]
(50 Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)
I change places, to prevent catchin' the cases
Races, in the faces, hall at you laces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
(50 Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)

I change places, to prevent catchin' the cases
Races, in the faces, hall at you laces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
(50 Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)

[Verse 3]
Yo, son remember them fake playas
Who try to play us at The Shark Club in Vegas
Had them tight linen blazers, and beat up gators
Lookin' like last year's playas, (pause) 
Yeah, I could tell they dough was low
When we came through the do'
I copped a case of Cristal, and copped one bottle of Mo
From the looking through face, and the bulge in his waist, he holdin'
(Yeah he's packin', I can see his rack
The one in the middle, he a big man, I dealt with him son)
Yeah, so I expect look like they ain't had a run, since ' 81
They ain't here on a hunt for food, 
So they could catch you, some cash, and expensive jewels
I'm gonna crash 'em with this bottle if he move
I ain't the one son, my shit ain't come easy
It won't go easy, believe me

[Chorus: repeat 3X]
I change places, to prevent catchin' the cases
Races, in the faces, hall at you laces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
(50 Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)

Yo, you know what I want? I want the beat to drop right..now 
niggas be thinkin' I'm crazy right?
you are crazy..
I ain't crazy...
you are crazy....
atleast I don't think I'm crazy
I think my shit is hot, I think I'm hot
you hot but you crazy..
why they wanna?..man..I don't know...

[Verse 1]
It's the money that - makes shit get ugly
It's the money that - makes these hoes love me
It's the money that - makes niggas wanna slug me
man..I thought the money would make it all lovely
Yo, I actually write what I do or see
the felonies from day to day make me say what I say
when I die my art will be worth more than Picasso's
Don't cry for me, smile for me
and if you see them niggas that wet me, wile' for me
remember the good times, the chips we stacked
the clips we packed 
and all the bricks we cooked from coke to crack
let my tombstone read "I Tried" and from the start
everything I wrote was from my heart
so it'll always be number one on my chart
I get sensitive with my shit, don't fuck with my art
sometimes it sounds like I'm playin' but I'm sayin'
this shit is real, it ain't a game.

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
They say the good die young
I guess these grimy niggas live a long time
Sit in fancy whips, sip champaigne and shine
Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine

[Verse 2]
First it happened to Stretch then to Pac and Big
I'm convinced it can happen to anybody kid
so I get vest up when I get dressed up
in the hood it's messed up, niggas runnin' 'round shootin' shit up
if it's Dom that you drinkin' fill up my cup
if you got somethin' to doubt me, shut the fuck up
why do niggas act like they hard when they know they butt?
and gettin' robbed ain't a good time to press ya luck
duke listen, if you move I'm'a hurt you
you'll get your turn to shine later, patience is a virtue
right now what you need to do is gimme the cash
forget about your Boss bein' mad, just save ya ass
be a good Boy now, go and get your stash
I seen you throw it next to the garbage can like it was trash
alright run along before I shoot ya ass
I hate to do this to you but I really need this cash.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I know we all gotta go, but I'd hate to go fast
then again I don't think it'd be fun to stick around and go last
man listen, if you really really like this shit
nigga call Steve Stoute and I'll write ya shit
call him now before I drop for real 'cause after I drop
I'm'a be chargin' ya'll niggas like Forty a pop
to each his own, me? I got it while it was cheap
typical mentality, I know, I'm straight from the street
1999's the year of the predator, I'm killin' to eat
niggas'll treat you like a egg, you come to cop you get beat
gimme your dough, oh, you wore your jewels? what a treat
you're a generous guy
take 'em off or die
man, we hurtin' 'round here, ain't nobody slingin' pies
look around, ain't nobody 'round here fly
why you 'round here with this shit anyway? huh? you high?
see, you done made the wrong move, kiss your ass goodbye.  

[Chorus]

Aight, check this shit out
Y'all niggaz gon' stay in the car
I'm'a go right over here and see somethin
Gimme ten minutes, If I don't come out, y'all come in
The money stays in the car 'til I say so...
Aiyyo, whattup whattup, man
This is what y'all niggaz is workin' wit' for 22 cents a gram? 

Man, when I come up in here treat me like I'm fam
I could go Uptown and get this shit for 16 cents a gram
Bottom line is, man, I gotta cop and go
I got a spot and I can't afford to stop the flow
Poppi, what the fuck is the matter wit' ya Man?
Standin' against the wall with a gun in his hand
I ain't on no funny shit I'm on some get this money shit
Every four days in PA I move another brick
According to the DA I sold dope in VA
my crew stay in Queens but my plates say VA
I'll show you where I rest at, it aint hard to find me
Let me buy a brick and get the other on cossimy
(Hey, this life is hard man) I know, don't remind me
If I catch another case I'ma kill Guiliani 
It ain't even safe to sell a pack at night
Got task ridin 'round the projects on Mountain Bikes

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
NY ain't the same, it's OT playa
you can go and cop coke from the corner Bodega
hit the highway and take it to a town near you
And get that money man, get that money man

[50 - singing]
Now, if you come to 1-3-4 and I'm not around
That means I copped and I went outta town
You motherfuckers know how I get down
About my money man, about my money man

Nobody likes me
Nobody likes me, but that's okay
Cause I don't like y'all anyway
... And I don't like y'all anyway
Fuck all y'all!!
My watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me
BLAT! Whattup homie
For bitches who don't know me
... They wanna blow me
Cause the shit I floss wit sayin a lot for me

[Verse One]
I came into rap humble, I don't give a fuck now
Serve anybody like niggaz who hustle uptown
Coke price go up, cats is come down
The D's run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found
The bitch who hustle for me, they dont even stash tracks
They keep it on 'em, right there in they ass crack
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrap your fuckin head like a Hindu
Look, I ain't goin nowhere, so get used to me
OG's look at me and see what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot Dice when he broke to So So
The thug, they pop shit, the thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to whole bricks
Nigga ain't in his right mind, goin against me
My picture's painted through words that make a blind man see

[Hook]
Scream murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder! (Fuck around and leave you!)
Murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder, murder! (Your life's on the line!)

[Verse Two]
Y'all niggaz don't want no parts of me
I'm tryna figure out how y'all started me
Make me catch her on the late night
Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off wit the six
I'm not a marksmen while spark issue, I spray random
Not a pretty nigga but my moms think I'm handsome
I hate to hear "He say, She say" shit
Unless he say she say she on my dick
It's no coincidence, niggaz who fuck wit me get shot up
I do a Cali style drive by and tear ya block up
You soft through, be puttin up a crazy front
I stay wit the Mac, cause niggaz tried to blaze me once
In the hood they be like, "Damn, 50 really spitted on 'em"
"You heard that shit?" "Yeah, 50 really shitted on 'em"
Beef, you don't want none, so don't start none
You just a small player in this game, play a part son

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
These cats always escape reality when they rhyme
That's why they write about bricks and only dealt wit dimes
Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car
Nascar, truck wit a crash bar, and TV's in the dash, pa
See 'em in the five wit stock rims, I just laugh, pa
I catch stunts when I ain't tryin 
I ain't lyin, I sit Dom P til I split up
Keep my rent split up
Get outta line, I get you hit up [Wooo!]
Now if you say my name in your rhyme, watch what you say
You get carried away, you can get shot and carried away
Now here's a list of MC's that can kill you in eight bars:
50, umm Jay-Z and Nas
I'ma say this shit now and never again
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
The games you playin, you get killed like that
Actin like you all hard, you ain't built like that
See me when you see me nigga, one (one)

[Hook]

Y'all niggaz don't want no parts of me
I'm tryna figure out how y'all started me
You gon make me catch her on the late night
Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off wit the six

How you gonna take this? like a Man or a bitch?
you gon' get it on nigga or you gon' snitch?
I represent niggas in the hood gettin' rich
man, I stack chips and I unload clips
after 3 Summers in the joint I thought life was hard
some niggas started fightin', some niggas found God
you know me, started sellin' leek in the yard
yo, I ran into niggas who used to have Hummers
big as Hell in the joint wearin' '86 numbers
damm Dog, you been in here that long?
you could think that, but say that and yo' ass is dead wrong
a convo is only three words, "yo whattup"
you ain't gotta work out to leave this bitch cut up
let a nigga find out you on some goin' home shit
and you tryin' to bounce without payin' a loan, shit
some niggas beat cases on the strength of they cream
after the witnesses disappeared on the strength of they team
I'm hard as Hell to get along wit' so it never fails
a nigga I got beef with end up in the same jail
he had a L rolled in bible paper blowin' the lye
I sent him a little kite just to be blowin' his high
and when I shot you in NewYork why would I box you now?
If I catch you in the yard I'm'a ox you down
niggas you think is real really can't hold they own
I'll have 'em on some E.T. shit tryin' to phone home
in here a gemstar is like a Nine Milly chrome
it's similar, infact they'll both split ya dome
scars are souvenirs, niggas always take 'em home. 

Chorus -
You got blown over the jack? (that ain't gangsta)
Your Man ran when you got clapped? (that ain't gangsta)
rockin' a vest with no gat? (that ain't gangsta)
you only a thug when you rap? (that ain't gangsta)
niggas jooked you for your track? (that ain't gangsta)
you ran to other thugs to get it back? (that ain't gangsta)
niggas ran off with your packs? (that ain't gangsta)
If you ain't bustin' ya gat (that ain't gangsta)

Verse 2:
You'd call me an Animal if you seen me livin' on lock
I stay in a box cats be shook when I'm visitin' pop-ulation
when I walk by, niggas like "Fifty don't play Son"
"yeah, somethin' really wrong with that nigga..."
max out, I'm goin' straight for the glock
bust a u-turn, I'm goin' straight to the block
the things that'll happen if niggas say I can't eat
down goes the window....out goes the heat
I'll make the whole block look like a fuckin' trackmeet
some get it in the leg, some get it in the back
some get it in the foot, bleed all over their airmax
nigga pump my packs or pay poor tax
it's extortion, it happens in the hood often
claim more lives than choices, free abortions
Rich Nice says I got a problem with the dice
'cause I put the title to the Benz on the line twice
I rock shit 'cause I stay on that block shit
that 9mm Ruger to your knot shit
see the difference is I'm real and you not, kid
I still stash crack money in my sock, shit
ya'll niggas wanna pop shit? I pop clips
leave with your blood on my mink in the drop Six
Guiliani and Pataki can't stop this
since '86 my whole clique pop Criss.

A pimp aint a pimp with no hoes (hoes)
A hustla aint a hustla with no motherfuckin dough (dough)
A thug aint a thug if his gun dont smoke (smoke)
A playa aint a playa if his ass dead broke (broke)

A thug aint a thug if his gun dont smoke (smoke)
A playa aint a playa if his ass dead broke (broke)

A hustla aint a hustla with no motherfuckin dough (dough)
A thug aint a thug if his gun dont smoke (smoke)
A playa aint a playa if his ass dead broke (broke)

(Repeat)

(50 Cent)
Is your bitch your bitch or is your bitch mines?
Is your bitch your bitch all the time?
You done got your paper, now its time I get mines
Except the serve and everything'll be fine
Bitch!

(50 Cent talking over beat)
Runnin from pimpin...bitch you need to run TO some pimpin
Wit them cheap ass payless shoes you got on hoe
You still aint figured out what a hoe supposed to look like
Look at you motherfucka here
Huh bitch?
How you gunna catch some dates lookin like that hoe?
Bitch get off the sidewalk and into the street
Bitch the sidewalk is for pimpin bitch!

(Fades)

(talking)
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty south?
One time

(Chorus)
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again, just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again, and again

Yo, when you hear talk of the southside, you hear talk of the team
See niggas feared Prince and respected Preme
For all you slow muthafuckas I'm a break it down iller
See Preme was a business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh
This here get ya seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
The roll with Easy Rider and they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects workin for fifty on five-hundred
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize cat
Heart me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pat
How he go out like that?
Rumors in the hood was ?? was snitchin
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSX-R
Had the four-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood draggin jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised
Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
Like L-A-N-Y's, L got shot in the neck, then told us connect
Them niggas who shot 'em got 'em for ten bricks
Fuckin Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks

(Chorus)

That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Quran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Remmy and Joe
And Prince and Rightous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles through the hood, I started learnin
Life's a bitch, with a pretty face, but she burnin
Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through wips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tata
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facin
Go against crews like B-Bo and killers like Patty Mason
A lotta niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that hail at old complexes like Cooley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had loved and sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louie Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizin, but son I'm dead serious
Montanna was no dummy, brought Benice to watch the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
FEDs couldn't catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion

(Chorus)

Yo, rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about yo
The twins was some queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy, Jamaican Pauly, Ducky Cally
Rodney Bump and Chick, shit
A lot a niggas flow the way I flow
but ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writin rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Comin up I heard sippin to much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see playas in this game that lose
I'm forgettin Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
And a conversation over shrimp and lobster
And Benny Hiners heard Chico stopped boxin, and started robbin diners
Shout out to Clanvis and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
If the flow don't kill you the Mac will

(Chorus)

[Talking]
Uh huh, Uh huh, five, five, one...., it's real shit nigga

[Chorus]
You niggaz say somethin' slick, you'll get SLAPPED for that
You niggaz schemin' on some jewels, you'll get CLAPPED for that
If y'all niggaz want war, I got the MACK for that
Run up with some work, and get your head TRACKED for that

[Verse 1]
Nigga if a nickel bag sold in the park, I want in on it (uh huh)
The bullshit I'm in right now nigga, I've been on it (yeah)
If I don't eat, nobody eat, code of the street
No surrender, no retreat, my niggaz rollin' with heat (woo)
You'll know my stees, I spark trees, under palm trees
Feel a breeze, and fees, in expanded keys (uh)
Cop it straight from the bay, tap dance on the yay
Your people make a G day, you ain't rich, you just ok
I take the stand under oath and lie
Before I snitch on my clique, I'll fry
Or watch time go by
Niggaz want to steal slabs, and dib or dab 
In the posse, who steals from the hands that feed 'em, deserve to die

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 2]
You gettin' money nigga (yeah), you dimed out (yeah)
Well 50 Cent is the hottest shit out this (yeah)
You bust your gun nigga (yeah), you on the run nigga (yeah)
You treat a grown man, like he ya son (nigga)
Yo, I ain't the first parolee, to catch his nigga for his rolee
And after being on the street, less than a week (uh huh)
Look, niggaz who know me, know I'm up to no good
Man my fan base is spreading like HIV in the hood
Why smack a nigga silly, when I can squeeze the nilly (squeeze that shit)
A slug'll split a niggaz ass, worst than the philly
I stay with the heater, cut the D with Bonita
My wifey kept acting up, so I had to leave her (woo)
It hurted when I left, but I knew I didn't need her
If it wasn't for my seed, I wouldn't even hafta see her
She tried to front like she don't need me, she miss me, believe me
It's that soap opera shit, the bitch watch too much TV

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 3]
Aight you niggaz tryin' to do too much (STOP FRONTIN')
Them little bit of chips you got son, (AIN'T NOTHIN')
I seen you with your whip outside son (YOU STUNTIN')
You spent your last on that (YOU AIN'T HOLDIN' NOTHIN')
Rap niggaz, they actin' like they ready to flip
When I let off a clip, it ain't a part of the script
Its like tradition, rap niggaz, dyin' they whips (dyin' they whips)
So I spent a little chips, to bulletproof my shit (bulletproof my shit)
You a 6 coupe nigga, but you years behind (years behind)
Nigga yours a 92, mine's a 99 (mine's a 99)
Your not in my league, the ghetto taught me tools to succeed
Shall up a seed, I'll write it down so you can read
If you've been listening, I know you like loving what I said
If not you dumb fuck, I just run over your head

[Chorus] - 2X

[*Singing throughout the entire song, and by itself until fade*]

(Chorus - 50 Cent)
It ain't easy to make money (Whoo)
So now everybody wanna take money (Uh huh, uh huh)
You ain't a thug, matter fact you a fake money (Take money, uh)
Fuck wit mines, I'ma view you at ya weight money
It ain't a game

(Verse 1 - 50 Cent)
You can call me player yeah, but I ain't playing fair (Uh huh)
Takers say I'm the hottest thang comin' this year (No doubt, ha ha ha)
In the hood niggas know, how I handle my problems
I walk up close, and I fo', fo' revolve 'em
Don't make me run to you, put the gun to you
Have yo ass on Phil Donahue explaining what the fuck I done to you
Thug niggas in the street saying I'm sunning you
Dude I'll smoke you every motherfucker under you
People say chill, but still I do, what I wanna do
For now on, when I speak, y'all niggas better listen
Why run against a thoroughbred when you ain't in no condition
Still got shit on ya nose, from all that ass you been kissing (hahaha)

(Chorus x2 - 50 Cent w/ Noreaga in background)
It ain't easy to make money
So now everybody wanna take money
You ain't a thug, matter fact you a fake money
Fuck wit mines, I'ma view you at ya weight money
It ain't a game
It ain't easy to make money
So now everybody wanna take money
You ain't a thug, matter fact you a fake money
Fuck wit mines, I'ma view you at ya weight money

(Verse 2 - Noreaga)
Yo where my down South niggas at, I'm playing piddy-pat
Wit this kitty cat, bitch swear she a city rat
It's Nore now, here look read the story now
My name Nore, and niggas know how I rip
And if I don't feel a nigga, I don't get on his shit
Y'all can love me, or hate me, or suck my dick
I like my hoes just like Summer, no class
And niggas working so hard, and getting no ass
Why y'all niggas acting like, it's all ill in y'all square
Motherfucker you ain't know that it's a hood everywhere
Me and 50 vandal, no we always run scandal
Weak niggas, have us lighting up candles
Sending out roses, condolences, notices
Focuses on, niggas like Fu Quan
Yo in they ground, niggas that don't get no bound
Y'all keep my word, don't love no bird
Get a beef from TM, and just twist my herb

(Chorus - 50 Cent)
So now everybody wanna take money
You ain't a thug, matter fact you a fake money
Fuck wit mines, I'ma view you at ya weight money
It ain't a game
It ain't easy to make money
So now everybody wanna take money
You ain't a thug, matter fact you a fake money
Fuck wit mines, I'ma view you at ya weight money
It ain't a game

(Verse 3 - 50 Cent)
Yo it's all about the cash you getting
Bricks you flipping, the whips you sitting
The bitches you hitting, when you living the thug life
Bitches I don't love no of 'em, the guns I'm running 'em
Punk niggas I'm sunning 'em, every chance I get
Man I know niggas is a trip, so I save all my grip
For these babies faggots flippin', dial 1-800-TIPS
Force me to bury the bricks, and the whips and take trips
Every word that come out of my mouth, I mean it, you could eat
'Cause when I stick you, you gon' cough it up like you bulimic
I'm no magician, but I could make, somethin' outta nothin'
Like turn an empty block, into a crack spot that's pumping
So all you niggas out there, thinking you the nicest
Me 50, I'm ya motherfucking mid-life crisis

(50 Cent talking)
Southside, alright baby, 50 Cent, Noreaga, Trackmasters, teflon

(Chorus - 50 Cent)
It ain't easy to make money
So now everybody wanna take money
You ain't a thug, matter fact you a fake money
Fuck wit mines, I'ma view you at ya weight money
It ain't a game
It ain't easy to make money
So now everybody wanna take money
You ain't a thug, matter fact you a fake money
Fuck wit mines, I'ma view you at ya weight money
It ain't a game

(50 Cent talking)
Know what I'm saying

If a bitch don't like me
Somethin' wrong with the bitch (fuck that bitch)
Why... oh why... why... you wanna fuck with me now?
Yo Dave, that shit come with the game baby, the money, you know
thats how the shit work, you know what I'm sayin'
they supposed to love me now baby
I'm doin' it now baby
hahahaha

[Chorus]
Girl, what makes you wanna fuck with me now?
I've been wantin' to fuck wit' you for quite a while
Is the money makin' you wanna fuck with me?
The money gonna make you sell your soul

[Verse One]
Whoa... if money's gonna make me slam these hoes... then alright
Whattup Shorty, I ain't seen you in many moons
talk to me, how's life been treatin' you? good I hope
you got a smile that only a fool would forget
and a figure that'll leave a nigga droolin' and shit
There I was, kickin' my game, pickin' her brain
buggin' 'cause a while back I met this bitch on the train
she wasn't feelin' me, I pulled up, she wouldn't talk from the whip
Uptown girl, she feel like thats some chickenhead shit
but on the sidewalk we ain't play games
we exchanged numbers and names
I went back to the Range
I heard her Girlfriend whisperin' "I know that nigga, he rich"
she think I got six whips 'cause me and my Man switch
anyway, her name is CeCe
she said she go to BMCC
push a '98 328 with chrome BB's
she said she seen me in the Onyx video on TV
she liked my part the best, man, this bitch is tryin' to G me.

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
It's hard as Hell to find a Girl thats really down for ya
type that'll hold down the Tre pound for ya
they into diamonds now, to Hell with pearls
these trick niggas fucked up, they done gave 'em the World
Hey Shorty, why you like me? huh? you like the way I spit?
oh, I hit your girlfriend, she told you 'bout the dick?
nah for real, am I the type that you wanna roll wit'?
platinum iced out, got rid of that gold shit
I love my lifestyle, you too, you love it
that I could blow Twenty Thousand and think nothin' of it
know you wouldn't fuck with me if I had no ends
probably wouldn't fuck in the whip if it wasn't a Benz
I guess life looks different through them Shanel tints
Man, I don't care if these hoes love me or not
long as I rhyme hot I'm gettin' head in my drop
it goes on and on and on and it don't stop.

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
One thing you can always count on is change
and a rich nigga to come put shit in the game
had a 4.0 then Jigga made you trade your Range
would've felt broke if you couldn't get your change
now it's hard to find us or stay behind us
while we on the 900 double R Hondas
watch the cats who flip bricks recline in the latest whips
while Penetentiaries stay packed with cats who sling packs
all these hoes ain't Madonna fans but all across the World
you can find a material Girl
I sip Dom 'till I earl
take 'em two at a time
quick I get in they mind
have 'em thinkin' they mine
bust off then tell 'em "Bust a Uey, on mo' time"
I'm like the reason ya'll niggas can't eat this year
got your bitch breakin' her neck to peep this here
c'mon... uh huh... c'mon

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

Fuck you bitch! leave me alone, walk on... get the fuck on...
Yo, Shorty... tell your friends ya'll ain't fuckin' with us...
aww man... look... he ain't mean that shit...
c'mon thats just records... niggas is playin'...
we wasn't serious and shit...

[50 Cent]
What y'all know about this fab shit, huh?
TE baby come on, uh-huh Trackmasters uh-huh

Look we can shop together mama, his and hers
Fifth Av. shit baby, Fendi furs
I ain't tight with the chips girl
I'm down to splurge
If it's ice you like I'll light up your life (Ooh)
VS2 Clarity alright
I play the block I ain't the type to punch your clock
I'm the type to put the metal to the floor in the drop
I live life in the fast lane
I make a grove of hash
Hustle hard for cash so I can spoil that ass
It's like she loves me, she loves me not
Cause her friends pump her head hull of bullshit alot
I gave jewels I imported for her
Chanel bags I bought from boosters
To the hood I introduced her
She feisty and sometimes she wanna fight me
People saying if I get knocked she ain't gon write me
The sick part is all that bullshit excites me

1 - [Destiny's Child]
    A thug's what I want
    A thug's what I need
    Even though my friends don't seem to see
    That he lace me with money
    He knows when I want it
    And I'm never gonna leave my baby
    My thugged out no good baby

[50 Cent]
Ay yo I treat you like you need to be treated like you're special
Tie your hands to the bedpost when I caress you
When I met you it was Guess and Gap
Now it's Gucci and Prada
Took you from being a nine to being a dime
You complain that we don't spend time
When I'm OT on the grind going hard for mine
Yo when shorty say she hate me
You know she mean she love me
When she play me close at the bar
That mean she want some Bubbly
See my polying with another chick and shit get ugly
She wanna flip threaten to run keys across my whip
Try to burn a nigga with some Hominy Briss
That's how she on it
When I met her she was lowkey
Now she wanna OD
You know me I let her do her thing son
I say what I'm feeling
Niggas say that I'm illing
I sip Cristy so I'm pissy
Like a staircase in your building
What?

Repeat 1 (2x)

Repeat 1 & 2 till end

2 ? [Beyonce']
    A thug is what I want
    And a thug is what I need
    And my friends don't understand
    How my baby laces me
    A thug is what I want
    And a thug is what I need
    And my friends don't understand
    And I think its jealousy

Trackmasters, 99 shit
Huh uh, huh uh, yea

[Chorus]
Slow dough, is better than no dough (fa sho)
Get caught talking to popo (what you say to him son?) 
They hit you with the fofo (blaow, that's right) 
My niggas is loco (loco)
Yo to diss me that's a no-no (no-no)
Y'all niggas is so-so (so-so)
That's why you ain't got no dough (broke ass niggas)

Put me through any test I bet ya I'll pass cause I'm a cheater
Broke niggas, smoke niggas, rich niggas smoke Cohiba's
My team been puffing chiba and packing heaters since the days of shell toe Adidas
And ain't shit come between us
Look I'm winning now and I'ma keep on winning
I see with you ain't nothing changed same ginen same linen
Fuck the don shit, nigga I'm an armed convict
I live wild beat cases before a trial
Grand jury style I'm foul 
You wondering why I don't smile
I'm schemeing to stick you up now 
Son I be the first to blast the gun, the last to run 
While you hit the pavement son I mash you, ugh
If you don't know you better go and ask someone
50 Cent is my symbol and my name
Symbolizing the change that I'm bringing to this game
Things'll never be the same (never the same baby) 

[Chorus]

Yo nowadays niggas talk like they wanna get shot
Like I won't grab the glock and run up in your spot
Six double O drop I'll put two in your knot 
And stick around and get every motherfucking thing you've got
Here I stand on the alley on godrule 
Same spot where rob got shot
The block's high 
Warrent squad flashing my mug shot
Everybody know I'm loco, kill the popo, blast the fo fo, rode dolo
Rock solo, I should be old T on the low yo
Pump the six and push the volvo
I hear they go kuku and go puff loco 
I sell llelo and price up and down like yo yo
But keep that on the low do, nobody's supposed to know, yo
I make 16 hundred off of every ho do
Fucking with the cash flow that'll get you blast yo (haha) 
I always get the last laugh yo

[Chorus]

I rap a muthafucking house around my my wrist for wreck 
While you niggas race neck to neck 
While niggas who live from cheque to tech
I ain't even going to front I ain't working with a full deck
Life in the hood so hard I done lost some of my cards
Instead of praying before I sleep I put my hands on my heat 
As soon as I start dreaming I'm right back on the street 
Any nigga in this game flowing they think they can see me
Gotta be, fucked up in the head and smoking hemee 
Believe me if you thought like me you could be me
But you ain't been through what I been through and this shit ain't that easy (one)

[Chorus]

(Phone ringing)
(Fifty)
Aww man...who the fuck is callin'?..

[50 Cent]
Look If you ain't worth a mil, you ain't far from broke
Got anought heart to sell weed but you scared of dope
I wouldn't snitch on my peoples if the feds grabbed me
Yo ass would hit more notes than Ron Isley
I wouldn't rhyme about Rolleys if I had no watch
Wouldnt write about crack if I ain't had no spot
You talk six coupe shit you only pushing a trey
Got bitches shutting you down in the C.L.K
For cats like you, crime don't pay
You just linger in the hood, them niggaz blow you away
You the type to get paper when I'm locked up, get yo jewels rocked up
Then have to tuck em in when I pop up
Niggaz in the hood sayin "50's Grimy"
Cause they hit me wit Kosami and now they can't find me
If you see it how I see it, my watch is yo whip
And I can cop anotha one afta each assist

[Chorus] x 2

[50 Cent]
You owe a nigga? You don't wanna pay him?
Kill him, that's what they said ta ta disapper him

She ain't hot but eevrytime I fuck the coke right drops
When it's time to get it on (what)
I pull over the thong (uh huh)
Fuck till I nut then get up, I'm gone (yeah)
Usualy hit it watchin tele way out in L.A.
I like it when she say "Papi I feel it in my Belly"
Call up all my niggaz in New York on the celly
First thing I'm sayin is "Nigga what da deally"
Pack a trey pound up under my Pelle Pelle
Y'all niggaz want war, clap clap, Oh really?
I watch niggaz slang packs in front of the deli
Got 20 inch chrome sittin on my perili
Lorenzo on the Benzo nigga you feel me?

[Chorus] x 2

Gettin fed thru his arm in a hospital wil slim him up
Get it thru yo head, 50 Cent don't care

Ya'll niggas wanna get high, well we gonna get high then
This shit right here is drugs, ya'll for sell baby
50 Cent uh, take it how you wanna take it nigga

[Verse 1]
Yo aiyyo, aiyyo, there is six different wings in the spot, choose one
Some get addicted, some do it for fun
Boy my hoes are clean, just like my guns
And I keep them in a safe place, just like my funds
I keep all my big bills, give my wifey the ones
Frontin' and I'll clap your ass and leave you for dead son
Niggas who know me, know how I get down, I'm fresh out the pound
NYPD crit the flip, get on some New York undercover shit
Fuck wit dogs you ain't familiar wit, and get bit
Niggas scripted through the hit, for some paper and shit
It's all about the cash, keep it in a stash
Some niggas talk shit wit they ass, I see through them like glass
Popo lookin' for me, for some shit I did in the past
If you don't like me at first, I'm gonna grow on you like a rash
This rap shit, I got it in smash, I'm built to last
Feel the wrath, I bust that ass, sit back and laugh (haha)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You don't have to respect a nigga, but respect his cash
Cause for the money, niggas will murder that ass
I came up fast, I watched a lot of gats blast
The power of the dollar (the cash, the cash)

[Verse 2]
Nigga don't you ever forget, I call the shots
I run the spots, extort your pops, flossin' drops
I'm "Livin Off Xperience" like Lox, I'm hot
Check what I got, shorty got knocked
Comin' up out the capsule spot
On the uptown block, he couldn't run from the cops
So my man got shot 
In a jet black Brasada, across the street from his mom's crib on his block
I told him get them niggas that cash, they murdered that ass
Niggas told 'em slow down, he was movin' too fast
Heard the shot, went through his face after the glass, he crashed
Hit the three on his niggas grass, the cattle said it got low fast
The kid who had it done was a crude fella
Who woulda thought he wile out over that mozzarella
We ain't know them, but now we know better
Not to fuck with his cheddar, his man pack a beretta
He won't hesitate to squeeze that, over that green back
Believe that, now niggas know that he's back

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I ain't got a worry in the world, if it's beef, don't sing it, bring it
Parents warn their kids, about people like me
I'm out of order, I turn your only daughter, into a transporter
Before I die, I'm gonna see more blow than Rich Porter (woo)
50 Cent, don't get it fucked up for greens, I for greens
Let it go back to Smith, I dissect it
I check and correct it, flow perfected
I make shit hectic, I wreck shit, nigga check it
If you ain't tryin' to feel the flames from the blast
Respect a nigga cash
My smile will rock niggas to sleep, pack heat
Fuck the police, handle beef on the street
On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm a 9 with 2 MM's
If your man want to get involved, I'll bring it to him
Niggas been wantin' me dead, I'm still here kid
They send their dogs to come get me
They wet shit, but they ain't hit me
Word in the hood is 50, shifty
Niggas they don't want to go against me
Cause they know I hunt your ass alive

[Chorus]

[Madd Rapper]
The art of getting robbed
This is how we do Brooklyn style boy you know what I'm sayin?

[50 Cent]
R.I.P B.I.G, R.I.P P-A-C, R.I.P niggas that wanna OD
Aiyyo the bottom line is I'ma crook with a deal
If my record don't sell I'ma rob and steal
You better recognize nigga I'm straight from the street
These industry niggaz startin to look like somethin to eat
I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, "You wanna see her again?"
Get your ass down to the nearest ATM
I have dreams of fuckin an R&B bitch
And I'll wake up early and bounce with all your shit
When I apply pressure,son it aint even funny
I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
Brian McKnight, I can get that nigga anytime
Have Keith sweatin starin down the barrel from my nine
Since these Harlem World niggaz seem to all be fam
I put the gun to Cardan tell him, "Tell your man
Mason Betha, haha, come up of that watch now
I mean right now"
The only excuse for being broke is bein in jail
An entertainer can't make bail if he broke as hell
I'd rob ODB but that'd be a waste of time
Probably have to clap him run and toss the nine
I'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks
Plottin to juice her for that rock Kurupt copped
What Jigga just sold like 4 mil? He got somethin to live for
Don't want no nigga puttin four thru that Bentley Coupe door
I'll man handle Mariah like "Bitch get on the ground"
You ain't with Tommy no more who gonna protect you now?
I been skeamin on Tone and Poke since they found me
Steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me
I'm a klepto nah for real son I'm sick
I'm bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school shit
Right now I'm bent and when I get like this I don't think
About to make Stevie J take off that tight ass mink
I'll rob Pun without a gun snatch his piece then run
This nigga weigh 400 pounds, how he gon catch me son?

[Madd Rapper](Chorus) 2x
This aint serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent how it feel to rob and industry nigga?

[50 Cents]
Ill catch P and Silk The Shocker right after the Grammies
And Will Smith and Jada ass down in Miami
Run up on Timberland and Missy w/the pound
Like you gimme the cash and u put the hot dog down
I figured it out 
Been robbin Joe before that's why his ass 
don't wanna be a playa no more
Mad at you I'm robbin J.D., FUCK YOU!! PAY ME!!
Had Da Brat with em, shoulda had his gat with him
DMX wanna get down well you tell homey
I'm on that Treach shit, I do my +Dirt All By My Lonely+
I should rob Clue man his shit did well
I wanna stick TQ but his shit ain't sell
I hit the studios take shit and leave
Catch Rae Ghost and RZA for them funny ass rings
Tell Sticky gimme the cash before I empty three
Ill beat your ass like that white boy on MTV
Cannibus wanna battle while I'm stickin them up
Nigga get capped coroners pickin em up
Heavy tried to hide his shit, nigga try to stall ya
He said "Why you robbin me I got _Nuttin But Love_ for ya!"
Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
Told him I want it all he said, "Even my gold teeth?"
I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black jeep
One at a time get out and take off your shine
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that I'd flash the nine?
And walk off with your shit like it's mine?
I'ma keep stickin niggas until I'm livid
I'll rob Boys II Men like I'm Michael Bivins
Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robyn Givens
I'm hungry for real im bout to stick Mister C
That nigga still eatin off Big's first LP
I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor
He asked me if I had enuff I told him "Gimme Some More"
Is you feelin this?  Then wait for the sequel
I gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbin Gods People

[Madd Rapper] 
(chorus)
For real yo you know what I'm sayin?
Niggas got to get stuck up that's just how it goes down
It don't matter if you an industry nigga or a regular nigga
It don't matter, if you got it and I need it I want it
50 Cents ain't fuckin around
Track Masters ain't fuckin around
Crazy Cat ain't fuckin around
The Madd Rapper aint fuckin around
So watch your backs, watch your pocket book, watch your pockets
Watch everybody on the train, watch everybody on the bus
Cause we gonna get you whether you like it or not

Rule number one don't go against the grain
Rule number two give respect where respect due
Rule number three if you get knocked play games and say names
(gun click sound) the 45 will tear you out the frame
Its like the rich get richer and the poor don't get fuckin thing
Don't mean nothin changed but the things my money bring
My style will leave you aggy like them cats in jail
You peoples got pleany money actin like they ain't got bail
I feel for you niggas gettin shot while I'm sayin this rhyme
Or niggas in the mess hall gettin shot on shallow lines
An old timer schooled me don't burn bridges my friend
Imagine the G-Dub close and yo ass gotta swim
I watch the fifth melt a nigga melt a nigga of the sidewalk of New York
Me and shorty saw from afar and had a talk
He said I told em if he came around I'd clap him, I gave him my word
Look at his head its still shakin he had alot of nerve

(chorus)
(Jadakiss sample: If it wasn't for the flow
 I'd probably have to double Back bubble crack)
(Jay-Z sample: yea yea I'm a hustler)
3x
(chorus)

Yo when the fed come in the game loyalty is limited
Hardcore niggas start actin feminine
With the feds you do eighty five percent of your time
Duke you get ten you'll damn near do nine
Hate a liar more than I hate thief
A thief is only after my salary a liar is after my reality
The streets I know'em like my ABC's
Stay away from the D's and stack ya cheese
Try to see three hundred g's fore you see three hundred C's
Tree top to feel the breeze co connect for key's
Yo bitches sexin me take me to ecstacy
Once I nut (ahh oh shit) I don't want 'em next to me
If its on mother fucker believe I'm gonna ride
I'm the type to swallow my blood fore I swallow my pride
Letters on my shirt read DKNY
Got grimy niggas runnin with me from BKNY

(Chorus)

They say I don't sound like a killer well how a killer sound
I bet I grab a foe pound and back that ass down
See many men live baby and many men die
Many men get drunk puff lah and stay high
Here's a jewel love you enemies and hate your friends
Your enemies remain the same friends always change
I don't quit that theres more that one way to skin a cat
You can get him in the face dog or down his back
All bullshit aside now its time to be honest
I fear no man for death is all thats promised
I got niggas standin in line waitin to hear me spit
From eighty six to ninety six the game went from sugar to shit
This for you niggas in the background dyin to shine
I hate you like fiends who ask for a dime for nine
Don't nothin change in the game but faces and names
Skate to wait to date and the jake

(chorus)

New York City...
You are now rockin with 50 cent..
Are you ready?
[Gun click]
I said are you ready?
See you wit me nigga?
DROP DEAD.

(mumbles:Paid for a hooptie but I wanted a drop)
"G UNIT"
"Somthin new"
I'm not that nigga in your video
I'm not a trick I don't love the hoes
and Niggaz know, I be on the low
but I miss my dawg
and I twist my drawer
I'm not that nigga that you think you know
I walk around with a big fo-fo
You front on me I'm gone get at your dawg
I be at rite are your crib, right at your door

What up 50?

Coming up I ain't have much, but I wanted alot
I had paper for a hoopty but I wanted a drop
so you know, I had make somthing outta nothin
Like turn an empty spot into a crack spot pumpin
im so hard at nine-teen I bought a benz, I did.
The older niggaz really wasn't feelin the kid
Try to find where I live so they could run in my crib
but you can't hustle a hustler I peeped it and slid
Back then, Niggaz used to call me bo
At six months I told them "Million go tops on Gar-bo"
Country came around, hes into clappin
country left, same shit started happening
Like "He shot rob for some ends, rob shot joe for some skins,
Cory shot drew and we was friends, money turned boys into men
The cycle never changes, shit just starts again..

"naw nigga, ain't nuthin changed nigga,
yea I've been gone for a minute, but I'm BACK!"
(damn 50 it's good to see you back in the hood)
you see my cherry red SL nigga I'm doin good
sometimes I can't find the words to say how I feel
so, I take a quote from menace "LOOK AT THE WHEELS!!"
I'm addicted to stuntin, now that I'm holdin something,
I got a trunk full of guns from VA to ?
     (oh will you let me hold something?)
nigga you high or something? I don't play games I'm
bout my money nigga buy something!
I got a few 5ths, I got a few 9's,
Here nigga take one...

"yea, don't ever say I don't do nothing for you nigga,
you kno don't say I didn't look out for you. KnowhatImean?
But make sure nigga that you go catch some jokes
when you come back you gonna have my paper for that thang thang knowhatI'msayin?
I don't want it back, don't try to use it then give it back to me
Cuz I ya'll niggaz now, runnin around sayin 
"50 getting all this rap money and he won't help us" ha ha...
Sit tight nigga I'm comin! You know?  New shit!!!
All the shit I put out on the mix tapes is for the mix tapes
I got a million... 
... 
OH MY GOD!! My shit is so hot right now I'm in the zone

I'm on parole, I used to be on probaaaaaation
I'm with my gun I get full coporaaaaaation
I tell you "take it off" no hesitaaaaaation
Nigga you play around, I lay you down
That's how it's goin' down
Don't play wit' me, I don't have patieeeeeents
My headachin', and I need my medicaaaaaaation
Niggaz be hatin', they don't know what they faaaaaacin'
Nigga you play around, I lay you down
That's how it's goin' down
I be in court throwin' signs like I'm a maaaaaason
Nigga witness against me, I'ma eraaaaaase 'em
If they try an runaway, I'ma chaaaaaaase 'em
Now with the pound, and I'm a lay 'em down
That's how it's goin' down

[Chorus]
Better watch how you talk
Better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York
That's how we get down
22's on the jeep
Somthin' deep in the seat
When we creep wit the heat
That's how we get down

(50 Cent)
Wise men listen and laugh while fools talk
Stick up kids don't live long in New York
Fuck around and catch the wrong jukes on the street
Get caught slippin', then get hit wit' like three
In every hood in the US, I'm that nigga they feelin'
Rap full of good guys, 50 Cent is the villan
I play the bar with 8 bottles all night gettin' right
Teachin' the hoodrats what Cristal taste like
I put 60 on wrist, 12 on my fist, 100 on my neck
We in the hood nigga schemin', what you expect?
My S on 22's leave ya hos confuuuuuused
On the track ready to choose, like "Daddy we want you"
My love live ain't change, the shorties still hug me
Bullet wound in my face, and bitches still love me
Now Nelly told you how them country boys talk
I came to teach you how we put it down in New York
That's how we get down

[Chorus]
Better watch how you talk
Better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York
That's how we get down
22's on the jeep
Somthin' deep in the seat
When we creep wit the heat
That's how we get down

(50 Cent)
In the city, a young buck'll tell you how the mac spit
O.G. give 'em the word, you gonna get yo' ass hit
I don't know why niggaz like to talk bad about me
I'm the richest nigga they know without a G.E.D.
Man it could be the money, it could be the ice
It could be they'd like to be me and can't live my life
You should here they be sayin' man "50 be flippin'"
"Shot my man over 7 grams, that nigga be trippin'"
I know death is promised, I don't fear gettin' murked
It's when a nigga half-way killa ya homie, it hurts
Now we can hit the club and get it crunked
Or you could start some shit, and I could hit you with
the pump, you can have it how you want
But I know you like my style (Uh-Huh)
Ya like how I break it down, wanna get rich?
I'll show you how, take this pack, pump these pieces
That's how we get down

[Chorus]
Better watch how you talk
Better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York
That's how we get down
22's on the jeep
Somthin' deep in the seat
When we creep wit the heat
That's how we get down

(Lloyd Banks)
Right now my life movin to fast to stop and pray
See every now and then I smile just not today
In my hood they let the choppers spray
Somebody probably got shot today
I named em pop when niggas surfboard
You aint stoppin me dawg
Only time you left ya hood is on Monopoly boards
You grimey as birds shittin on the top of ya fords
You will, die by the gun if you aint droppin ya sword
I got tattoos as well as lead marks
To me fucking is kinda like racin and I always get a head start
My opinion of a sweet dream is a dead NARC
Just yesterday guns is blastin with red darts
Beef, you a target
Cause when we come at yo ass, Aladdin wont be the only one the carpet
Man you wanna play wit a ringer?
I aint a peoples person
I'll give my next door neighbor the finger (fuck you)
Even though I got the shit in the stores
I'm like a nigga that borrow clothes
Bitch, I'm tryin to get in ya draws
Man I'll dump a whole clip in ya mans braids
Pussys love Nelly, he made it look cool to wear bandaids
I'm blowin on damn haze
All of a sudden I'm gased, cause I'm on the radio and I can't wait
If you aint up on thangs
Lloyd Banks is the name, G-Units the game
Now I know to keep low when the heat blow
I'll have niggas post up on ya block like I'm shootin the free throw
Still get the green from P-dro, better known as Pedro
I'm ghetto like a patty ya egg-roll
Yea they feinin to stick me, they don't know the meanings is wit me
Snuck in wit Christina and Brittney
You only spend time at the mall
On New Years eve a body drops around the same time as the ball (yea)

(Chorus- Banks)
G-Unit, G-Unittttttt,G-Unit, G-Unittttttt,G-Unit,G-Unit (repeat)

(50 Cent-between Banks)
G-Unit nigga that's what's up (repeat 6x)
That's what's up

(50 Cent)
Keep thinkin I'm candy
Aint nuttin sweet about me
Nigaas talkin in the pens and in the street about me
Some jake, tryin to watch every move I make
Cause my Deez'll make fiends do the up-town shake
I'm a pro, far from a amateur, holdin more keys than your fuckin janitor
They say "God bless the child that could hold his own"
You pay cops to hold you down, I just hold the chrome
Every breath I take, every step I take, every move I make
I got a ruger on my hip
You aint gotta like or love me but you gone respect me 
You need a fifth and 2 clips to try and check me
12 in the afternoon we can start the clappin
Look homie I'm down for that day-time action
Keep thinkin it's a game time in front of ya home
Get the drop on that ass and shot shadder ya bones (yea)

(Chorus- Banks)
G-Unit, G-Unittttttt,G-Unit, G-Unittttttt,G-Unit,G-Unit (repeat)

(Tony Yayo)
Listen boy, Tony be the real McCoy
When hoes see the new toy, they jump for joy
And even though the kid rappin 
I still got fiens in the hood puffin on that Magic Dragon
My guns under my pillow, I sleep wit my shoes on
Every single night me and my mack get our groove on
Don't get moved on
Cause I shoot through your bicepts your tricepts 
Then breeze through ya projects
When the coke come back
It's the China White
And the d don't sweat us in a bag a rice
Let's ride O T 
And burn the tape
I got this bad mommy, her mouth's a sperm bank
Since Yayo be a fearless man
I donate my heart to them niggas that ran
And, those niggas in the hood don't wanna see me famous
They rather see my moms make funeral arangements
I got enough rhymes, to fill 6 notebooks
I been spittin that shit ever since coke crushed
You can hear me on your T.V. and radio at the same time
I never ever say the same rhyme, it's Tony 2 times
Beware of my wraith, I'm gone school you niggas
Prepare for class
Yo I peep where your puns at, peep where you pumped that
Money you tryin to stack I spent it on blunt wraps

(Banks)
Word to my mother nigga 50 fuckin Cent nigga

NYPD, LAPD, NYPD

[Verse]
Niggaz wanna shine like me (me), rhyme like me (me)
Then walk around with a 9 like me (me) 
They don't wanna do it, 3 to 9 like me
And they ain't strong enough to take 9 like me
Aiyoo, you think about shittin' on 50... save it
My songs belong in the Bible with King David
I teach niggaz sign language, that ain't def son
*click* *click* you heard that? That mean RUN
Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stun on, pa
Pull through, I'll throw a fuckin cocktail at ya' car
From the last shootout, I got a demple on my face
It's nothin', I could go after Mase's fanbase
Shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doctor to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth *huck-too* spit it out
I don't smile a lot, cause ain't nothin' pretty
Got a purple heart for war, and I ain't never left the City
Hos be like "Fitty, you so witty"
On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P.Diddy
You got fat while we starve, it's my turn
I done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn
Won't learn

[Chorus 2X]
If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me
Like me duke, you not like me

[Verse]
Moma said..
Everything that happened to us, was part of God's plan
So at night when I talk him, I got my gun in my hand
Don't think I'm crazy, cause I don't fear man
Cause I feel when I kill a man, God won't understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan
I been coulda killed these niggaz, I'm still waitin
In the telly with to whores, a Benz with to doors
32 carrots in the traws, no flaws
You see me in the hood, I got atleast two guns
I carry the glock, Tony carry my M-1s
Hold me down nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me
D's waitin for my response to lock me
This is my hustle, nigga don't knock me
You need some shit with banana clips to try and stop me
I'M THE ONE

[Chorus 2x]
If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me
Like me duke, you not like me

[Verse]
See, I done been to the Pearly Gates, they sent me back
The good die young, I ain't eligable for that
I shot niggaz, I been shot, sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta, so I stand some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me, you wanna know me
From 3 point range, with a glock, I shoot better then Kobe
See a nigga standin' next to me, he probably my Co-D
See a bitch gettin in my whip, she probably gon' blow me
See the flow is like a 38, it's special yoooooo
A country boy tell ya, I'm fittin' to blowwwww
I'm more like a pimp, then a trick, you knowwww
See, I'm in this for the paper, I don't love the hooos
Niggaz broke in the hood, worried about mines
Grown ass men, wearin starter piece shines
You know them little pieces, with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
When the gossip starts, I'm always the topic
You too old for that shit dog, why don't you stop it
Shorty, I been watchin you watchin me
Now tell me what you like more, my watch or me
Haha

[Chorus 2x]
If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me
Like me duke, you not like me

*Ad-libing to the end*

[repeat 2X]
50 bars of pleasure, 50 bars of pain
When I'm dead and gone niggaz gon' remember my name, 50

[50 Cent]
Yo, Black is flashy like Alpo, gun happy like Papi
Sneaky muh'fucka 'mind me of nigga that clapped me
He ain't the type you shoot dice with and win dawg
Unless you want to get your ass laid out in Gilmore
He had some soldiers, 'mind me Troy and E-Bags
When they came through they hollored like, "Whattup Conrad?"
Grimy niggaz, they loved to get gully
Summertime, still had on black gloves and skullies
The Lex 450 pulled up that's Cornbread
Them niggaz from Philly woulda called him an old head
But he a O.G., 'mind me of Chaz and Bump, real low key
Sounded like they don't know nothin about drama
For this money shit many men do trauma
Switchy walked in son, this bitch had the baddest ass
The bulletproof glass was rolled down on his S-Class
Heard in D.C., he kept mad blocks in order
Picture this, a young nigga gettin it like Rich Porter
Sonny came in for half a pit - he got knocked
He on lock still controllin the spot from Comstock
Pop pulled up in the CL5, surprisin Caine
His man just got fucking merked by some lame
Heard he got it in the Range nigga Caine popped one in his brain
over some-thang, took his watch and his chain
Country boys off the hook down there in Richmond mayne
In the black 740 I sat, my hat turned back
"Down down baby," Nelly singin my wrist blingin what?
I'm waiting on this nigga Wise, three loaves for two pies
Son he smokin that shit, I can see it in his eyes
Comin up Wise, and locs is close
And locs ride 'round lookin for wires to toast
Benny hopped out the Escalade with a few thorough men
From B-More, they sellin heroin in Maryland
Reverts back to Diesel, killed like 4 fiends
His popularity grew, that only meant more cream
First it was him and his brother, now he got a team
Went from 5 and a half grams to livin the dream
Seen he pulled up, God damn, you know his format
Bentley is all marble in the door, mink floor match
Hit the hazards, out the stash box popped 2 glocks
Peace "All Eyez on Me," 2Pac
Everybody know he a boss he still gotta floss
He on the same bullshit that sent Gotti up north
That's Ty in the blue TS, stuntin like he Nicky Barnes
He broke but he talk like he a Don
Homes hoppin out the Jag that's Max, Haitian cat
Kill a nigga quick remind me of Haitian Jack
I peeped his style son I know his steelo, he on the d-low
He smile at niggaz mumblin fuck you in Creole
Heard war stories bout how he maneuver with the Ruger
Hold the iron horizontally and send shots through ya
Few niggaz tried to merk him, most them got found
Some turned away try to run they in wheelchairs now
Banks hopped out, bulletproof this, bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel, bulletproof hat
Got out a black Hummer, he blew 90 on that
Poppin mad shit like he gonna bulletproof that, let's go

[repeat 2X]

Since 'How to Rob' a lot of niggas been naming names
Monkey see monkey do, I done changed the game
Still niggas acting like I don't get down or something
Like I aint the next nigga to wear the crown or something
You gonna talk about your chips till we run in your crib
And you gone ask dumb questions like "Can I Live?"
Look, If I shoot you, I'm famous
If you shoot me your brainless, you said it yourself
I'm slick enough to twist your lines and send them back at you
Swift enough to snatch the mack and pop that at you
Take it personal see if I won't send you to hell
I've done told Ton and Pok? they better have my bail
But if its over a mil don't put the crib up dun
Cause if 50 get free nigga, 50 gonna run

[Chorus]  2x
It's best you be a gentleman
and you watch what you say (bwahh bwahh, nigga take that)
Or Jesus Christ can't save you once you go gangsta, friend
(bo! bo! bo! bo! bo!...It's gangsta)

[50 Cent]
Look I'm supposed to be cocky, I ain't a po' no mo'
I ain't gotta steal from the corna' store no mo'
Got my own crib, I ain't sleepin' on the flo' no mo'
Bouncers don't try to play me at the do' no mo'
But when they see me they say search him
"He might have the nine
He might shoot this motherfucker up like Shyne"
It's been a while since a new nigga came tight like this
Ya man, he aight, but he ain't quite like this
Niggas is feelin' it
The Benz pullin up on the set (uh huh)
Me jumpin out 30 tho on my neck (uh huh uh huh)
And since you said it was nothin' to sweat (what)
That you was outta line so here's what you get
A verbal ass kickin'
Jesus Christ sent me to test ya
Let's see how see how he act's under pressure
Till Makaveli returns it's 'All Eyez On Me'
Till the feds build up cases and find pie's on me

[Chorus]  2x
It's best you be a gentleman
and you watch what you say (bwahh bwahh bwahh, bwahh nigga take that)
Or Jesus Christ can't save you once you go gangsta, friend
(bo! bo! bo!, It's gangsta)

It's gangsta, 2000 shit

(Echoing)
Ya'll know what you need to do, get together,
 make a We Are The World record, faggot ass niggas)

[Chorus: *Scratching*]
Pain In Da Ass "Fuck You" 3x

Styles "I don't give a fuck who you are"
Pain In The Ass " Fuck You"

[Verse]
Either I'm trippin' off the ecstasy
Or I could feel the world turnin'
I'm havin' flashbacks, I can feel the shells burnin'
Comin' up, I was taught never back down
That's why I act the way I act now, hold the mac down
32 shots, squeeze til there ain't a shell left
Come with my gun smokin', you can smell death
They get the first laugh, I get the last laugh homie
Hit the gas on it, pull up and mash on 'em
There's a lot of talk in the streets about me
Niggaz know, ain't nothing sweet about me
Get back to questions, like "50, who shot ya?...
You think it was Preme, Freeze or Tah, Tah?"
Nigga, street shit should stay in the street
So, keep it on the low
But everybody who's somebody already know
A few words for any nigga that get hit the fuck up
My advice if you get shot down, is get the fuck up
LET'S GO

Chorus (Different Variations)

[Verse]
Maaaaaaaaan
I told niggaz not to fuck with me they still push me
Figured they'd get away with it cause Tone and Poke pussy
I been gone through static, shot at with automatics
Since 90, when Nas came out with "Illmatic"
If Suge was home, Death Row would be good for me
Cause Tommy Matola ain't shootin out in the hood wit me
I've been shot 9 times my nigga that's why I walk funny
Hit in the jaw once, why I talk funny
With a Ruger on my hip, I walk the street with no care
Think my grandma's prayers the only reason I'm here
My wrist icy, keep my ears icy, keep my neck icy
That's why you bitch like me, so I'm a heavyweight
How dare these niggaz take me lightly?
I ain't come to make friends and niggaz aint gotta like me
My own homie said "50, you done lost yo' mind"
Cause I shootout in broad day, run and toss my nine

Chorus [Different Variations]

[Verse]
Can't find a nigga in the hood, that say "50 ain't hot"
When I drop, I'm sound like Eminem and Kid Rock
Play the block, with the watch all rocked the fuck up
Jukes me, A week later y'all be shot the fuck up
Born a healthy baby, I wasn't always crazy
This aint how moma rasied me, this how the hood made me
The D's call me by my government name
I be dumb and shoot up parks 
Have niggaz runnin' like "Jesus Comin'"
There's wet pillows in prison, niggaz cry in the dark
Cause if they did in the day, niggaz would question they heart
So when they come home, the come home
Walking that tough walk, talking that "Rockavalede"  
Talk'll get you shot in New York - BBBBLLLLATTTTT  
Sex, money, murder, I gotta eat
But I aint tryin do +Hard Time+ like +Pistol P+
See, niggaz uptown understand me in the street
You niggaz uptown'll "Stan" me in the street
Ha-ha

"Niggas bit off Nas shit"  - Ghostface Killah

(Repeat)

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
You can be a ridah and ride, or a coward and hide
Either way you go against me, you still gon die
I got four macs, a few nines, I'm ready for beef
You wanna talk, it ain't about money, then let it be brief
I need a drop for when it's a hot, a hummer for when it's cold
An ill attorney's in my corner when these fake niggas fold
The shit I kick fuck with niggas mentally, makes them wanna mention me
And see me doing a quarter century in the penitentiary
Nastradamus predicted 50's the future, that's a fact money
I run up on your workers with the mac, like where that pack money
I'm a tell ya'll what Papi told me
I got what you need, 19,5 a key
I stay catching a stunt, frontin' in somethin' mean
And I'll clap any nigga for the right amount of cream
Run up on them all with the same problem solver
Beat up ass, tape on the handle, trey eight revolver. What!

[Chorus]
Projects too hot, niggas better hope we never hit rock
Cause then we gonna run up in your spot
Screamin' get the fuck on the floor, give us the Ro'
(Repeat)

[Verse 2 - Nature]
Aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
I'm like Sugar Shane Mosley, it ain't no beef
You're staring, a ticket holder that sits in row three
Next to Ron Artest and Kobe
Yo I woulda went pro too, then I let them phillies slow me
I'm like a black man's asthma, seeking a pump
Breathin' deeper when I'm creeping up
Ya'll need to fuck with the tightest, I stick niggas
Ensevilitus, leavin' whole families in silence
My virus is obvious, past on to most rap fiends
Un cured, ain't no vaccine
Last seen at the automatic teller machine, maxing out
Or in the studio booth, blacking out
It's Con Ed style, real twisted, I disappear on some Blair Witch shit
Comin' back I'm rich kid
Either or, you can't stop me with my feet in the door
Or walk away from the street or the morgue, play your part nigga.

[Chorus - Last line cut off]

"Niggas bit off Nas" - Ghostface Killah
"Admit it, you bit it" - G. Dep
"Tell these niggas somethin' God" - Ghostface Killah

[Verse 3 - Nas]
What, yo
I disturb niggas and white boys, with five pointed stars
Tatted on they arms, pimp your moms, like I'm Magic Don Juan
From Queens to Hong Kong, weed in the bong
We smoke that, leave our minks on the coat rack
Those that plot on me, nine times outta ten the nine is on me
Feds search the God, but nothin' they find on me
When I rap don't wait to clap applaud sooner
Unless you hate a nigga like George Bush Jr., I bring awkward to you
Porsche maneuvers thru the city like New York sewers
Stinkin' up the air, Central Park, horse manure
Rims is 22 inches, Benz suspensions
22 inch dick when I'm pimpin'
Impotent you niggas get me sick, wanna be soundin' like
You knowin' my arithmetic, but we don't sound alike
50 Cent with Braveheart-ed, we ride to the grave depart us
You fake niggas imitate what I started, let's go

[Intro - Once]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1 - Nas]
Hats off, to da rich ones who flash and floss
Pour some liquors out to my dogs trapped up north
Reminisce on the deceased who no longer exist
Only wishin' we could bring them back with songs like dis
Old flicks on us chillin' wit da old time click
Holdin' nines, thoughts of death, not our lives we risk
How it use to be, early morn, pumpin' in shifts
Jakes wit pale faces in the night is the scariest
They handcuff me, they knew my government and alias
Various calls were made up for awarin' us
The D's in the marked vans and cabs
In our land, hoodrats get stapped by niggas who forty
Turnin' out young lady's and make them make thoughties
Got them coked out, the hood is bugged out
Thug babies, famous in they strollers
Before they walk they knew the hood talk
It's in the air of New York
So everybody'll pick em up, kissin em up
Treatin' them like they own, in dis hood we call home
Fist fight till we grown and these guns come out
Circle of life, it's kinda deep how we end out.

[Chorus]
Yo them niggas that wanted beef before
Don't want no beef no mo
Now that they know who I rep with
QB NIGGA!!!
Who I rep with
QB NIGGA!!! (repeat)

[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
Ya'll niggas better sober up before ya'll speak to me, don't come at me high
Last rapper that raised his voice to me, got japped in da eye
Now if I say I'm gone get you, I'ma get ya
On da strength of da inf, from long range I can hit ya
You find out them niggas who wit ya ain't even wit ya
After da gem stars split ya, you need an MD to stitch ya
Peep how I use words to paint pictures
Peep how I got niggas with bodies askin' me for ten cents to got hit ya
Look my name up in the law book, Curtis Jackson
Known for creatin' action, by rapidly clappin'
Nigga I stay strapped, so much I nickname gats
Got a tech I call Tina, a nine I name Nina
Two niggas went to see Allah afta they seen her
This QB shit, bout to take me to da next level
Next crib, next Benz, next bitch, next bezel.
It's that real.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Bravehearts] (Millennium Thug, Horse, Jungle, Wiz)
Yo, aiyyo, who da fuck wanna war
I got a four four, pierce ya'll niggas jaw
You see me thugged out, iced out, Guinness Stout
Hopin' out the Range wit da gun out
Smack your man down, you ran off
I was gonna hit him with two, I left some for you
I put four, QB rugged and raw
I got somethin' for these rap cats, fish held back gats
Scope wit a beam on it, loc put your cream on it
Shine don't scheme on it, I make your dream about it
Forever, whatever whatever get gully
Shots thru your leather and clothe, With your skelly off
Break ya'll clowns off
Yo hollow tips will flood your jacket, I don't give a fuck who you be
Millennium Thug, now who da fuck want it with me.

I mastered the art of slap boxin' niggas in da dark
QB's big man, Horse of the Bravehearts
I'm da Sasquash of rap, collector of gats
Testin' macks at your bulletproof vests and hats.

How bout that, guns bust off, I bust back
When trucks backfire, I bust back
How bout that, stomp a muhfuckin' rib out ur back
Ya'll niggas ain't gangsta rap, ya'll click like Josey and the Pussycats
When we come around da front, stop.

Uh huh, ya'll can't fuck around ya'll get dropped
When guns pop, who's tellin'
Twin barrel nines wavin' and yellin', QB NIGGA WHAT
Two-time felon, straight to da melon, straight to da dome
Send a nigga back, get da shells, go straight home
Never slip, my +Ill Will+ to survive is so deep
Can't sleep, cousin to death, makes me weak
Pullin' triggers at my shadow, Bravehearts pop up
Wiz, Jungle and Horse shot your block up.

[Chorus 2]
Them niggas that wanted war before
Don't want no war no mo
Now that they know who I rep wit

(50 Cent)
Yo this is 50 cent, yaknawsayin?
I'm here with my man Whoo Kid, you know how I put it down nigga
It's not safe around here as soon as the street lights
G-Unit nigga

{*random shout outs*}

(50 cent and G-Unit)
We can't get Money selling weed...WE GON SELL COKE
Ain't no money sellin' coke... WE GON SELL DOPE
Ain't no money sellin' dope... WE GON SELL X
And if niggaz wont by the X... WE GON SELL TECS

(Lloyd Banks)
My advice for y'all niggaz is stop frontin
'Cause 50 say pop somethin', I'm gon pop somethin', what up?

(50 Cent)
Don't make me send a nigga to you, 16 shot ruger
Send twelve shots to you, run four in the clip
Get in the whip, it's a wrap

(Lloyd Banks)
Nah fuck that

(50 Cent)
Man, you done hit the nigga twice in the head, that's that
Niggaz running with the steel out, now it's time to peel out

(Lloyd Banks)
50 let me drive

(50 Cent)
Nah I got this, nigga chill out

(Lloyd Banks)
It'd be nice to get the niggaz ice, get it, give it back

(50 Cent)
Just get in the corner store cause it's full of them A-rabs
They blowin' the shit up like it's okay
I got a bomb on my waist I'm Kamikaze (*laughing*)
I dare Ds to get next to me

(Lloyd Banks)
Or a nigga to creep up and put a tec to me {*explosion*}
Yeah, yeah that's it, it's a freestyle
The fuck you want for free?
Fucking A-rabs just ran the planes into the fucking building
Coke price went up 10 grand this fucking week

(50 Cent)
Uh, yeah, 50 Cent
It's Murda Mix Tape Vol. 3
Whoo Kid, Stretch Armstrong nigga
Take that, yo, aiyyo
Niggas don't wanna see 50 on a track
I got these cats that rap scared of me like I'm Ace and Jack
Fuck that, if I was you, I be scared of me too
Yo Stretch, roll the weed, while I tell 'em what I need
I need cream by the stacks, shells for the mac
Rims for the 'Ac, and a bitch to blow her back
I need the coke to come back, mad time on a jack
I got the Fendi sweaters, all I need is the hats
I need the police to chill, stay the fuck off my back
See a nigga in a Benz, sway peddling crack
I need a stash box son, so I could stash the gat
I need a stadium light, to leave 'em blind as a bat
Flipping from under my plate, while I'm running from Jake
I'm making mistakes, look I need extra pace
My man up north, need the new Stretch Mix Tape
I'm physically fit, nah for real son I'm in shape
I need that Beyonce bitch, to take me out on a date
Niggas follow my footsteps, 'cause everything I say, slick
But I need y'all niggas, to get off my dick
My description in three words, real witty cat
I'm in the club in ATL, I'm where the titties at
What, what, 50 Cent nigga, 2000 shit, Stretch Arm-Strong
Whoo Kid nigga, Whoo Kid nigga, Whoo Kid nigga
What, Whoo Kid nigga, this how it's going down (*echoes*)

Aiyo, I know these niggas don't like me
But I don't like none of ya'll niggas, you know what I'm sayin
50 cent, 9-9, motherfuckin doo wop
Volume 3, take it however the fuck you wan' take it
Faggot ass niggas (50 Cent show these niggas how to rock)

Yo, they done shot that boy down like a dog in the street
Left him smelly, man fuck that, roll em over take that fellas pellet
You ain't never heard a motherfucker spit like this
Not even puff, and that nigga there made crazy hits
Every few years a nigga come who crazy hot
I'm the next best thing since Biggie and Pac
Now I'm sayin this shit slow, so you don't miss it
Don't be a statistic, my jewels from the district
Stay with my biscuit, touch mines and get twisted
Son I'm off the meter, my mind locked on crime
See I'm tired of all these rappin niggas dyin to shine
And I'm tired of fiends askin for a dime for nine
Hearing this next punch line from me, may sound strange
You sit your 5-dollar ass down, before I make change
Yo the sale went stale, caught em real bad
Fresh out the jail, shit is really real
Niggas is still in jail, and I pray they don't tell
20-man inditement, my lawyer gotta fight this
Niggas know, I ain't never pressed for dough
And niggas know, I don't serve nobody I don't know
Son said he was from O.T., pay 11 an o.z.
My man brought em to me, see he ain't really know b
That it was hot, dude was a cop
He was just tryin to pop, to put the new beams on his drop
First I served him o.z.'s, then I served him whole keys
Now we all co-de's, damn man I O.D.
You know how it is on the street, niggas is holdin the heat
Po-Po walking to beat, we burnin l's up in the jeep
Ain't nothing sweet, we used to move so strategic
It's over I can't believe it, damn it's over
Fed's ceased the six, the Lex' and the Range Rover
Now a nigga rollin in a Toyota Corolla
Used to never get high, now I'm never sober
380-6 shot glock top load-up
Keep it in my waist son, I'll put one in your face
I ain't got nothing to lose, nigga so stay in your place
Just jumped bail, I ain't been on the run long
But it feel like a motherfuckin marathon

Bump Dat
Niggas try to stunt on my click 
Then when I get on that shit 
I bring it to 'em where they pump at
12 Gauge mashberg 
No shell in the head
Before you put in work, you gotta pump that
You done hit a nigga with it and you runnin to polices
Come and take my advice, nigga, dump that
This is serious, these rap niggas, I'm just havin fun with it
50 Cent, nigga, Bump Dat

[50 Cent]
My son ask "Daddy why carry a gun, you ain't a cop"
Looked at him and said "Sometimes you gotta shoot or get shot"
Wanna go to show-and-tell and show the class my glock?
Show 'em the clip
Show 'em the beam
Show 'em how Daddy lean
In the convertible Jag
22 inch mags
For a high school drop out, shit, that ain't bag
I'm not a blood or a crip, I'm doing my own thang
G-UNIT
Shit, I done started my own gang
I don't go that funny dance
I don't throw gang signs
But I'm a gangsta to the core so I stay with a nine
Think all I do is rap, then you don't know me good
Have Smurf hangin out the sun roof to light up your hood, man
Cause Lethal ain't never seen Blaco comin'
But if he did .. you think he woulda started runnin?
And I move with the Doublemint Twins and two macs
And leave you flat your back

I gotta half a mil deal with no diploma

Its hard to live, but its easy to die
So I'm going through life lookin death in the eye
These rappers ain't gun slingers
They R&B singers
G-Unit, come thru with some guerilla niggas
Minimum wage ain't gonna pay the rent
Cause the seats in the coupe got the Fendi print
And this shit right here for the listeners pleasure
I'm still on the strip with the fifth and my ever
Its T-O-N-Y
Stay with a semi
Milk your crack spot - till the shit be bone dry
You think you pump hard?  Nigga I pump harder
My phone ring so much, I walk around with the charger
When the D's come around, I'ma swallow my crack
Shit the work out later, and hit 'em with that
If it's a direct sale
I'ma change the bill
Tryin to push the new Range cause they changed the grille
Look nigga we icey thugs
We stay with them things so we stay with some Nike gloves

You should sit, scibble lines and see where it take ya
Had violent tendencies, so they thought I was dumb 
Why the so called smart kids was poppin' guns
I think about poppin' a gun, and then get the lump sum
Grampa my role model, yousta suck on a bottle
A pint a Crown Royal, make your insides boil
Been smell like Ben Gay, cause his back go out
He the one that taught me, what bein' black's about
Now peep the roach on the walls, that fall and crawl on my friend's 
Wrist, Sittin' up in them Benz, to be in the pen
In the hood we hit the number, but never the lotto
Life in the fast lane, one wheel hit the pothole
Let's go, let's flow nigga

[Chorus - Singing] - 2X
War, what is it good for absolutely nothin'
But niggas keep frontin'
Fuck a nigga, live like a soldier

See I always get my way girlfriend, I'm spoiled bad
Keep my hydro stashed in a Crown Royal bag
Your performance will determine the price

And 9 times outta 10, I was pissy when I was with you
But they don't make a liquor strong enough for me kiss you, nah

I don't fuck wit' scurry ass niggas
That ain't got a care in the world

Admit it, I'm that motherfuckin' nigga you lovin'
New York nigga, soundin' like I'm straight up southern
What bitch, don't try to play me close to see what I'm drinkin'
Yeah I'm rich, I ain't a trick, what the fuck are you thinkin'

Or 1 to 3, for an extra G
RIP to Etho, I miss Hevo
When I die, I hope heaven look like the ghetto (yeah)
Picture me trick, and take a loss

[Verse 2 - Tony Yayo]
I never mix money and product with my friends (uh huh)
These chips, make relationships come to an end (what)

And been on the block, ever since bunny tops (c'mon)
250 grizzies, scrape the plate (scrape that plate)
Got me on 750's straight from the plate (straight from the plate)
You can call on your soldiers, call your recruits (uh huh)
I do you dirty like Raheem did Dirty is "Juice" (Juice)
Allow myself, to introduce myself
This is Tony, the talk of New York, I'm holdin' the belt
I got thug in my blood (blood), game like a pimp (pimp)
And wrote my first verse, takin' baths in the sink (yeah)
And yo I fear no man son, I never heard of a fair one
Never gotta borrow a handgun
Niggas on the street, gettin' smoked like bran son
So I stay dirty like "Sanford and Son" (yeah)
Groupies gossipin' stay runnin' their lips (woo)
Cause they seen the Gucci seats in the 6 (uh huh)
And seen the Fendi grips on the four fifth (what)
Shit, I sell bricks, shit, I sell shit on a stick (stick)
Enough of the talkin', let's take it to the valance (uh huh)
The New York streets, will leave you physically challenged (challenged)
Don't be surprised, If I spit at you
Then come to your wake, and serve fiends at your funeral
Our bread is goin' towards a brick of dope
Cause I've been goin' hand and hand since "Different Strokes"
I'm a 50, an eighth, you a half a blunt
You the nigga in the mirror that practice stunts
WHAT!

Yeah nigga

And I'ma drink a lot a water 
And I'ma take Golden Seal, so my PO don't find out

Yo, niggas wouldn't rob Frankie if they had the chance
Wasn't cause of him it was cause of his man Lance
Frankie cut crack
Lance hold the Mac
If fiends fuck with Frankie's pac's
Lance cut the crack heads blocked up
Thought he was locked up
Came thru stuntin' wit his wrist all rocked up
Shoulda seen him smile, missin' the tooth
Coupe missin the roof
He like "What up, 50?"
I'm like "What up with you"
Lance had a reputation that was well earned
Heard he taught niggas how them shells burn
Out there in Red Firm
At the dice game, he rolled ahead, crapped in the crack
I'm like "Nah, I ain't paying for that!  Nigga, shoot it back"
Niggas lookin at me like I'm crazy, they shook
I don't give a fuck who he shot out in Red Hook
Asked him about ????
Yeah, Bizzy was my man till he beat me for ten grand and sold my Mac for
seven grand (Fuckin' crazy)
The man was crazy I could tell by his look
Cause he looked the way I look
When I look for a jooks
Bitch

[Skip]
Everytime I'm in the kitchen, you in the kitchen
Let me finish this brick, 'fore you put that fish in
Listen, I know we just came from fishin
But I'm on a mission, you see, there's money that I'm missin
I got 'em posted, so the move and I'm gonna murder y'all
You and all the trouble goin through by servin y'all
And only cause my man heard of y'all
Other than that, shit, y'all won't get served at all

[Tony Yayo]
I went from oodles and noodles to lobster and shrimp
I went from bare bubble coats, to brand new minks
And yo my neck upgraded, my wrist's upgraded
I stay C of F, I ain't got time for Jacob
I'm still on the strip, tryin to get my grims off
Nigga tryin to flip and its a Mexican stand off
I put a hole in your grill, with the nine mil
Dressed in all black, lookin for souls to steal

[Chorus] - 2X
Little bit of dust, little bit of cocaine
Little bit of dro, little bit of heroine
A little bit of ecstacy
That's why your bitch want to be next to me
We sell a little bit a everything

[Young Buck]
I put the two Mags, up to your doo rag
And rockaby baby, I'm in the blue Jag with new tags, in case you wanna chase
I never knew that, the impact, comin up out a Desert Eagle
A make a nigga wob and wiggle screamin call my people
We got these fiends pourin liters, and they shootin needles
Need to be takin your connection, cause we got it cheaper
Shit I ain't new to this, I met this air stewardess
Who knows the ins and outs on how to get it in and out, nigga

[Lloyd Banks]
Ya if I put a dress code all black, nine hows and a laser
And the party is an ink pen, bottle, or a razor
Your hollerin for praise ya, catch me in the hood with a model named Taysha
And the swallow game major
These cowards ain't gangsta, they tellin you lies by sellin you dreams
And they ain't fill ins, they fiends
Plus they rat, and it's too hot to chill in the sun
My pops 39 years old, and still on the run

[Chorus]

[Juvenile]
Wodie what you want, you want dope, you want coke
Wodie what you want, you want X, you want dro
Shit you got beef, I got a tec and a fo'
You feelin' hot and moist, I even get you a ho
If you don't got no whip, I get you a car
If you don't got no skills, I get your some more
My nigga we don't cut it, we serve it raw
Got anythin you want, play us awful hard

[50 Cent]
My 22's bling, so niggaz scheme
745i clean, this little shell nigga, fuck a triple beam 
Coffee pot to cook coke, Joe to smoke, I was born to loc
Method cut the coke, 50 no joke
I ain't "Scarface", no women, no kids, I don't give a fuck 
Better teach that bitch, and that little nigga to duck
With a P-90 Ruger, I put shots all through ya
If you survive you gonna feel what talent do to ya

[Chorus]

[Intro]
New York City (New York City), you are now rackin' with 50 Cent (with 50 Cent)
Are you ready? (are you ready?) (*gun cocks*) I said are you ready? (are you ready?)
See you with me nigga? (with me nigga) Drop that! (drop that)
Paid for a hooptie but I wanted a drop

[Verse 1]
G-UNIT! Somethin' new, somethin' new
I'm not that nigga, in your video
I'm not a trick, I don't love the hoes
And niggas know I be, on the low
But I miss my dough, and I twist my dro
I'm not that nigga, that you think you know
I walk around with a big four four
You front on me, I'm gonna get at you dog
I be right at your crib, waitin' at your door
(What up bitches)

[Verse 2]
Comin' up I ain't had much, I wanted a lot
I had paper for a hooptie, but I wanted a drop
So you know, I had to make somethin' out of nothin' (Yeah)
Like turn an empty spot, into a crack spot pumpin' (woo)
Also hard at 19, I bought a Benz I did
The older niggas really wasn't feelin' the kid
Tried to find out where I lived, so they could run in my crib
But you can't hustle a hustler, I peeped in a sled
Back then niggas yousta call me boo
In 6 months, I sold a million gold tops on got brew
Country came around, ease it and clappin' then
Country left, strange shit started happenin'
Like C shot Ra for some ends, Ra shot Dro for some chins
Cory shot Drew, and we was friends
Money turns boys into men
The cycle never changes, shit just starts again

[Verse 3]
Nah nigga, ain't nothin' change nigga
Yeah I've been gone for a minute, but I'm back
Damn 50 good to see you back in the hood
You see my cherry red SL, nigga I'm doin' good
Sometime I can't find the words to say how I feel
So I take a quote from Menace, "look at the wheels"
I'm addicted to stuntin', now that I'm holdin' somethin'
I got a trunk full of guns, from VA today
(oh yeah, let me hold somethin')
Nigga you high or somethin'
I don't play games, I'm about my money, nigga buy somethin'
I got a few fifths, I got a few nines
Here nigga, take one, catch it took, and bring me mine

[Outro - 50 Cent talking]
Yeah, don't ever say I don't do nothin' for you nigga
You know, uh, don't say I don't look out for ya
Ya know what I mean, but make sure you nigga, you go catch some jokes
And you come back, nigga have 'em, and have my paper for that thang thang
You know what I'm sayin'? Say I don't want it back, nigga don't try to use it
And don't get it back for me, nigga and no shit like that
In fact, I can see ya'll niggas now
Run around sayin', 50 gettin' all this rap money, and he won't help us (haha)
Sit tight nigga I'm comin'
You know, new shit, all this shit I put out on the mixtapes
Is for the mixtapes, I got a million, OH MY GOD!
My shit is so hot right now, I'm in a zone

[Chorus - 50 Cent] (Tweet)

[Tony Yayo - talking over 2nd part of chorus]
Yeah, um, YAYO!

[Tony Yayo]
Don't call me bitch, don't be naggin me
Cause the police thinkin 'bout baggin me (baggin me)
You wanna call me on my cell, but don't got money for bail
And you the main reason that I'm stuck in the jail
You showed 'em where the Mag at (uh huh), showed 'em where the stash at (uh huh)
Got a order of protection, no I'm doin five flat
In my heart I thought you was the one
"Til you dialed them three numbers 9 1 1 (BITCH)

[Chorus - 50 Cent] (Tweet)
(Call me) Why you naggin me?

(*Starts off with the beat of Tweet's "Call Me,"
then changes over to Bubba Sparxxx & Jadakiss' "They Ain't Ready")

[Intro - 50 Cent talking]
Uh, yeah, G-Unit, uh, yeah 50 Cent, uh, yo

[Chorus 1 - 50 Cent, imitating Timbaland]
Timbaland sounds so good, but I might not be ready
I don't know
If I spend a 100 grand on the beat, then we done bumped already
Now here we go

(*harmonizing over the beat - doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
(doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo) (Pee Wee Herman)
(doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
(Niggaz look down to Pee Wee Herman)

[50 Cent - Verse 1]
50, lefty, no gun in my right palm
Bronx niggaz love me, like they think our mics on (WOO)
These rap niggaz not like me, they too soft (yeah)
Get shot down, I get up, shakin' shit off
You know white collar crooks, do jokes on lap tops (uh huh)
Real niggaz snatch glocks, and run up in spots
We can talk Trump talk, real estate, stocks, and bonds
Or gangsta shit, my Rugers and glocks in palm (uh huh)
Danger, ring the alarm, kiss the ring of the Don
I conquer like Genghis Kahn, I said song in this song (god damn)
I won't hesitate to put a knife or a slug in you
And watch you bleed out, that little bit of thug in you
You don't want to bump heads with me, and get hit up
You, you ain't got what it takes to fuckin' get up
Holla niggaz names on records, that shit is played out
But holla mine in your next line, and get layed out

[50 Cent - Chorus 2]
My jewels look so good, and my chain is so heavy
I don't know
If I should stunt for these hos again, cause I did that already
Now here we go

[Lloyd Banks - Verse 2]
(Lloyd Banks) I don't give a fuck if your favorite rapper dies, to me thats my spot
I'll celebrate his burial and eat at IHOP (yeah)
I've been hungry since a little nigga weed in my high top (Woo)
Face burgundy red, in need of a eye drop (uh huh)
I had the black Delta Force, blue in the front
Back when Jordan was flyin', and Ewing could dunk
Of course, you can fuck now, you was buyin' the shrimp then
Me on the other hand, Don Bishop and Pimp King
(*harmonizing of "doo, doo" plays in backgroud until G-Unit is yelled)
I'm runnin' from a digital Munster
I do this for the hood and every kid in a dumpster
My name is poppin', and I ain't been at it long
My neck's 16, and made Flex drop a Benz latin bomb (G-UNIT!)
I'm the best thing to happen to hip hop
Since (uh huh) "Life After Death" and that Tupac shit drop
I'm even good to a white boy with a slick top
Stuck up in the mountains with a gun and the wrist pop
Who? where?, Master P says our watch don't tick tock
I'm cleanin' out my 6 shot, watchin' the Knicks flop
Damn near the whole damn passenger green
Thats how my bedroom, look like the World Trade after the scene (smoking)
Breaking news, hijack, bus passenger scream (yeah)
I'm your worst nightmare, I crush half of your team
To me your line up is pussy, three wet Pampers
The uzi will have you shakin' like them G-Dep dancers (damn dude)

(*50 Cent - harmonizing "doo,doo,doo"*]

*beat stops

[Lloyd Banks]
What the fuck happen to the rest of the beat man?

(50 Cent laughing)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Everywhere I'm at everywhere I go, I stay surrounded by hoes
Even when I'm tryin to be on the low, I'm recognized by hoes
Man, its gotta be cause of the dough, its got to be cause of the dough
Cause the game sure wasn't like this before, it wasn't like this before

[Verse One]
50 Cent I'm makin hits now
Don't try an act like you ain't heard I'm the shit now
Some bitches changed, cause they know I'm fittin to blow
You should see how they react when I come through the door
In the club my niggaz, we fittin to ball out
Drink till we fall out
Some shit jump off, nigga we goin all out
Shots big enough to tear the fuckin wall out
I'll have your punk ass on the dance floor tryin to crawl out
I had bad luck, then my luck changed up
You see the Range, you see the rims all blinged up
You ain't hear what I charge for 16, I'm makin a killin
These other rap niggaz just catching feelings

(Chorus)

Haha, yeah
Yeah that's it nigga, what the fuck you thought
I ain't giving niggaz more than 16 for a motherfuckin freestyle
The fuck you want for free man
Ya'll niggaz be wanting a lot for free man
Fuck them other niggaz, other niggaz can't rap
That's why they give you 100 motherfuckin bars for nothing man
You know what I mean

Haha, the fuck man

Lloyd Banks in the house, bad news
Tony Yayo in the house, bad news
50 cent in the house, bad news whenever 50 around it's bad news
Tray pound's in the house, bad news
40 Kal's in the house, bad news
I got a knife in the house, bad news whenever 50 around it's bad news

[Lloyd Banks]
Niggaz mad cause I'm flossin' bad
I ain't a wrestler, but I'll put your bitch the Boston crab
I talk money cause it costs to brag
Round here bitches walk around wit the hair that the horses had
Rap it get your face stuck on them bricks
I don't really like to exercise but I'll push up on a bitch 
Y'all sweet like ninety-nine bananas 
That's why I got ninety-nine niggaz wit ninety-nine hammers
They all want a nigga to stop
Cause I rap slick enough to slip the ring off of Vivica Fox
I'm just a playa that found out where the coaches know
That's why I'ma be around longer than the Oprah show
You and your man y'all both should know 
That all it takes is a finger to send you where the ghosts go
Shit I been hated since the fifth grade
That's why my best friend the tray pound, a ice pick, and a switch blade

[Chorus]
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, Banks' back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, Tony's back at it again)

[Tony Yayo]
Rule number one pick a target and study him for weeks
See where they rest at and lay with their peeps
Now you got the drop, know their daily routine
So the second rule please leave the crime scene please
Third rule pick a day, fourth rule pick a time
Fifth rule pick a fifth, sixth rule pick a nine
And the seventh rule make sure your sidearm sweet 
So when the shootout you leave him six feet deep
Eighth meet in a fast car with disguise
Use a ski mask with shades on your eyes
Ninth rule don't say shit cause po-po listen
Fuck around you end up being stuck in the system
And the tenth rule don't put a tag on a broken heart
Just put a toe-tag on your mark
And rule number 11, you caught a body but you not a legend
You better watch where you heading

[Chorus]
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)

[50 Cent]
Don't go go against me I'll hurt your feelings
Stones in my cross the size of your earrings
My confidence level's high nigga can't tell
Lickin my lips at ya bitch like I'm LL
I smile like a nigga in jail receiving mail
Better yet like nigga Bookers that made bail
From day one I came in the game they said I was hot
They got scared, "Cent got money," and I got shot
You so much pressure on me when you compare me to 'Pac
I'm just a new kid, I can't help that I'm hot
What little niggaz say to 50 cent don't matter
I'll fire shots at the chef and watch the sheeps scatter
My enemies never turn into friends, my friends turn into enemies
You scared then get the fuck around me
Record execs, know not to play wit my check
I come through with my knife cause I'm a pain your neck (YEAH!)

[Chorus]
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)

Lloyd Banks in the house, bad news

Catch ya slippin' i'ma give you what I got for ya
My clip loaded wit' 16 shots for ya
Never had a hot gun on your waist and blarin' to shoot
Cause a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you?
Homie you ain't been through what I been through
You not like me and i'm not like you
I'm like a animal wit' it when I spit it it's crazy
Got semi-autos to put holes in niggaz tryina play me
One shot is not enough you need least a uzi to move me
After four bottles of Dom the kid start feelin' woozy
I write my life you write what you seen in gangsta movies
I'm gangsta to the core nigga you can't move me
I found my space at the top I got this rap shit locked
I never heard of you you heard of me I murder you
Spit shells through your convertible
Lowest you notice?
Rich or poor hollows still go through your door, this is raw
You scared of me you not prepared for me the kid is back

[Scarlett] We from the Harlem streets
[50 Cent] E, F
[Scarlett] Don't talk me to death
[50 Cent] G, H
[Scarlett] It's elementary

[Scarlett]
Picture me rolling Range Rover
Same color your Air Force Ones
White on white, ya like?
Red I flight the night
From L.A. to N.Y.
I'm Harlem bound
You see how bitches tense up, when Scarlett 'round
Niggas get the heart to holla while we up in the club
But get intimidated when they see me sitting on dubs
I hear 'em whispering " dat ain't a man, shit that's her."
She roll with them G Unit niggas, that's what's up
Disrespect me, I'll have niggas blast ya up
Take my advice, don't let ya peoples grass ya up
I got a fetish for the chips
20's for the six
Hollows for the clips
Try me, if you think I'm playing bitch
And the police we'll have another crime scene taker
Jim Star crush your head, give your ass a shape-up
Uptown niggas known for the money they make
Everybody ain't shook, you see doing the shake

[50 Cent][Hook]
The boss spending ends
Saying, "Gimme that Benz, 20 inch rims, and four TV's"
The snitch in the precinct saying
"He sell X, he sell techs, and he sell D"
The balla by the bar saying, 
"Everybody drink, the best champagne, it's all on me"
Snitch in the back of the police car
Pointing out the window saying, "He robbed me"
It's elementary

[Lloyd Banks]
1,2,3,4
[50 Cent]
Lloyd Banks' in the house
[Lloyd Banks]
Now get the fuck on the floor
I slid through the front door
With the 9 and the velour
A cal in my pocket
You wil', I'mma pop it
I'm down for a profit
I'm ghetto as hell
You can't you tell?
My road dog, under the jail
Getting frustrating mail
So I'm drinking and smoking
Thinking and hoping
This cell gon' open
You can dance next to me, but don't throw an elbow
I'll throw one back and leave blood on your Shell Toes
Hell no
I ain't paying for pleasure
Your pussy don't bring rainbows and pots of treasure
It's every girl's dream, to floss with the team
Long on the suine
DVD's on the screen
Blowing on cream
Waiting for you to scheme
You ain't gotta know how to read, to spray a magazine

[Hook]

[Tony Yayo]
I don't wanna grow up, I'mma hustler kid
Go'head and stunt, see I don't pop two your wig
I'm artistic, intelligent, so much ability
When I use them big words, your bitch be feeling me
So ya'll niggas hate me, 'cause your wives be our groupies
Ya'll irritate me, like loud people in the movies
Fall back, matter fact back down
'Cause I just passed security without no pat down
You can catch me in the bathroom blowing a sticky
Or catch me on the dancefloor feeling some tits
Sex sells, so I'mma P-I-M-P
So my pockets never be empty
It ain't no problem, we scoop them models
We got condoms, coups, and lavish condos
50 got me getting ass like I never did
So when I step in the club, hoes love the kid

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
The cat in the house go
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
The bird in the cage go
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet
It's elementary

[50]
Nah, I don't be fuckin wit them fat bitches

[Chorus]
Don't be stuck on the things they say

[50]
Them Twinkies got your ass gettin' fat fat
Them cookies got your ass gettin' fat fat
That paint got your ass gettin' fat fat
Bitch you grown, that ain't baby fat fat

In the gym I see your ass up on the stair master
But you got it on level 2, bitch go a little faster
Look girl I ain't gon lie, I'll tell you how I feel
They should hand cuff your big ass to the treadmill
You wanna work out now, cause you know its gettin' hot
And your big ass fin to pop all up out the halter top
Find the right chick, wearing some tight shit, and it's on
See your ass wearing some tight shit, we like "She wrong"

[Chorus]
Don't be stuck on the things they say
now you know it's a nasty world (know it's a nasty world)

That Burger King dun got your ass fat fat
McDonald's dun got your ass fat fat
That Dominos dun got your ass fat fat
Yeah, It's nothin' but a little baby phat phat

[Lloyd Banks]
I like 'em slim in the waste, curves in the right place
A bitch wit hips, lips, and a nice face
Your appetite'll put a dent up in a nigga salary
You need to stop burnin that weed, and burn a calorie
Your attitude is like you always have gear
You got a pony tail, you ain't always have hair
I just wanna see your Capri's comin' down
Mami we run the town, stay away if you 300 pounds

[Chorus]
Don't be stuck on the things they say
now you know it's a nasty world (know it's a nasty world)
I ain't fuckin wit you anyway
cause I know your a nasty girl - You's a nasty girl (know your a nasty girl)
I ain't never gon discriminate
so let me compliment your eyes

[50]
I'll say something nice about ya eyes, cause you's a big bitch man
Yeah, It's nothin' but a little baby phat phat
Them Entenmann's dun got your ass fat fat
Them Little Debbie's dun got your ass fat fat
These cup cakes dun got your ass fat fat
Yeah, It's nothin' but a little baby phat phat

[Tony Yayo]
I ain't no trick, I ain't have to borrow with my wallet
Freakin' off in your car, on your closet
It ain't nothing wrong wit a big, strong girl
If you can cook your ass off, I'll give you the world
You can be skinny or fat, white or black
Nigga pussy is pussy so, yeah, I'll hit that
I'm a freak, sure I love minage a trois
And I really care lees if you twice my size

[Chorus]
Don't be stuck on the things they say

Them Twinkies got your ass gettin' fat fat
Them cookies got your ass gettin' fat fat
That paint got your ass gettin' fat fat
Bitch you grown, that ain't baby fat fat

Stay the fuck away from, you fuckin fat bitch
Fuck wit Tony Yayo, ho

[50 Cent]
Yo, yo we can't stay alive forever
So if shit hit the fan then we might as well die together
I'm high as ever, more holes and more cheddar
G-Unit move around wit them pounds and berreta's
Yea faggot, if I want it I'm gon' have it
Regardless if it's handed to me or I gotta grab it
Don't make a ass outta yaself tryin to stop me
I'm cocky, raps rocky, nigga you sloppy
You know that I'm, 8 levels above you nigga
I'll club you nigga, I never heard of you nigga, ugly nigga
I'm the wrong one to provoke
You rattin on niggas is only gon' leave you smoke
So the only thing left now is tools for these cowrads
I got no friends, fuck most of these cowards
They pop shit 'till we start approaching these cowards
While we lay around dollars, they lay around flowers

[Lloyd Banks]
I got a intergangstress who argue and steams wit reefer
And who flip when I call a bitch like she Queen Latifah
Not all the vehicle's is long enough to stash the streetsweeper
This shit can get uglier than the Master P sneaker
We slidin through the ruckus, wit prada on the chuckus
Soon as spring break ho's home from college wanna fuck us
I ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckas
I'll sick rottweiler's on you fuckas, cops followin to cuff us
Top dollars to discuss this, whole lotta zeros
When it comes to paper I blow a soul outta aero
I'ma break before I lay floor berry
Besides, every rapper ain't a star, nigga plad ain't bulbary
You can't tame Lloyd, smokin by the big screen
You changin the channel looks like I'm playin the game boy
I know to watch botherin ya vision
You reach and I'll put a dot on ya head like its part of yo religion
Why party wit a pigeon?
I'm blowin a 10 cuz Bush handin flyers for a party in a prison
I'm in the gucci vest wit the green and red straps
I'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack
Now every morning's a fast start
And there aint problem gettin dressed cuz my closet got more aisles than pathmark
Run, move startin a wave
and leave wit 12 shells in ya mouth like a carton of eggs
I'm the young pimp pardon my age
I don't got long hair but if I did she be puttin my braids
Niggas find what club they at
take 'em wit us, and run a train on 'em like a subway mac
get advances from grey agra
see these record labels got most artists gettin fucked like the gay rappa'
i go the college on the tour
I'm goin down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur
I keep ya ammo clean, text polished in the drawer
Camera's by the hamper that mine into the floor
by now, you probably heard of me
fresh outta surgery, flashy as a fuck, you gon' have to murder me
Burglary, I'm leavin wit cha nike's bergendy, White T, bergendy
you match now, back down
niggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear
catch me on the boat wit weed smoke and official gear
heavy when I toke, C notes from different years
Besly in the robe, re-motes for liftin chairs
You ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya
I send cars to crib like I'm a cab dispatcha
you better off wit ya stupid guys, lookin for a coupe to drive
you ain't gettin nuttin but ya french fries supersized
it's a damn shame y'all still local
I'm in a million dollar studio layin my vocals
Nigga

[50 Cent]

Back seat of the Benz truck or Expo
Back seat of X5 or Range Rov'
So when I pick you up, you know how this shit go - hoe

[Tony Yayo]
Hey yo, my truck talk for me
If I was bummy and ugly
Your bitch'll still have love for me
As long as I push a truck, rims chunky
Never open my lips, your bitch wanna fuck me
Beep the air horn, hop in turn the heat on
Pick you up off the streets get your feet warm
She giving sex cause the Lex truck takes unleaded
Big thick thighs, eyes browner than Sahara deserts
Deuce-Deuce, bitches, yeah they caught your eye
And them loud system full of bass and highs
You see that X5 BM
Packed with Puerto Ricans
Bad mommies on the low, just creepin
Niggas be frontin like they bubbling coke
But they really struggling with a high car note, ha ... (YEAH)

[50 Cent]
Might see me in the Jeep
Rollin' 'round 4 deep
And you know we on the creep
Nigga, I'm holdin' it

[Hook]

[Tony Yayo]
Back seat of my truck lets swing an episode 
Fuck a hotel we have sex on the road
I pull the seats back
Put the sheets in the luggage rack
Pull out my balls
And play an Aaron Hall track 
I tell a chick "Bend over, mami"
Hit 'em with the Henny Dick
Now my windows foggy
Its time to party, I got TV's, CD's and DVD's
Now bitch, get on your knees
You could be a model chick or a silly hood rat
Don't cum on my leather, don't stain my floor mats
Where's your baby mama?
She in the truck and I'm blessin her 
Undressing her
Make hop out for air re-freshener
I ain't stressing her
'Cause my rims keep checkin her
She's 21, my rim size older than her
TWENTY TWO'S

[50 Cent]
Niggas say they want beef
But when they see me in the street
They don't slow down to speak 
'Cause they know I'm holdin ..

[Hook] 

(chorus)
When you frown at me is it because I wont provide for you girl

And you friends they see it to screaming we know what your up to do girl
I'm after my cheddar

(50 cent)
I gave you your style Gucci this Fendi that
Burberry bag shoes and the hat to match
I like the way it look but bitch I aint buying that
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but no more Prada shoes
When I just wanna chill you wanna go out
See me parle with some other chick you wanna show out
You say I'm wrong when I dog yo ass like I should
now you reminisce about all the time I treated you good

(chorus)

(Lloyd Banks)
when you think about me grinding my fans
You even got more watch on but it's to much time on your hands
They say behind every good man is a woman
So tash pull up stash the cannon linen
I'll never be your chofuer to the mall
You'll learn to appreciate cd's and posters on the wall
fatal attractions is mad real
Last bitch I deaded got mad and swallowed 50 Advil's

(chorus)

(Tony Yayo)
They say money make the world go round
Material things make a hoe go down
I see you in your Prada Gucci and BCBG
Bitch I'm rich but I don't trick on GP
That's 5 dollar dresses and 10 dollar skirts
Bitch play the strip and put in work
Birds wanna have my baby since I signed my contract
Now I got to double up in case the condom snap

(50 cent)
Look don't ask me for shit man
I aint got nothing for you man what?
Bitch what the fuck you mean I can't sing bitch
Bitch I'm Luther Vandross in the shower

[50 Cent]
It's a fact homie, eagles don't fly in flocks
But the eagles I got own sixteen shots
Like beefin', homie I ain't sayin' a word
I'll run up on your punk ass squeezing the bird
Now what New York niggas know about country grammar
Not much, but we know how to bang them hammers
When I pull out that thing, you better break yourself
Or win a trip to ICU, and you can take yourself
If you lucky motherfucker, I'm solider I told ya
Push ya shit back, put my knife through ya six pack
Gat bust, adrenaline rush, blowin' the dust
Five point O, burnin' the cluth, while I'm burnin' the dutch
You thought them other niggas was hot, I'm turnin' it up
This the blueprint, nigga are you learnin' or what
You done told me you respect me, now tell me I'm the nicest
Admit it nigga, I'm a mid-life crisis

[Hook]
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! (I got the rep of a villian, the weapon concealin')
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! (full of controversy until I retire my jersey)

[Lloyd Banks]
It's like niggas rate the respect of who gat bigger
Banks been blowin' on purple stuff before that fat nigga
Henny's make dollars, and dollars make death threats
I'm doin' remixes to bulletproof the Lex next
Duck nigga, everdays war
I'm heavy on sports, to my draw like NBA's store
Don't make me send the piece at you
I'll have your man walk around with another rest in peace tattoo
Look creampuff, you can get killed here
Nigga you ain't invincible, even Superman in a wheel chair
I've always been a picky man, but I ain't a flowered star
So I'mma fuck all fifty fans
Look, whether you like it or not, right in ya spot
All in your grill, wearin' the crown, airin' em down
We're in the pound puttin' fare in the clown
I'm running with gangstas, don't make one of em shank ya

[Hook]
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang

[Tony Yayo]
I'mma ride with my rap shit and my body armor
Ride like a Taliban suicide bomber
Four five six feet, I off ya feet
I kill ya with a pillow when you fall asleep
Your records can't sell, your company is buyin' em
Give it up, Burger King is hirin'
You shoulda been a cop, cause you snitch a lot
Talkin' to the jakes, you bound to get shot
I used to watch Big Bird and Scooby Doo
Now I'm choppin' big birds and them bundles too
For that Master P money, that shoppin' spree money
That coke, that dope and that ecstasy money
I'm tryin' to build empires across the state line
So move like vampires, never see me in the daytime
I jump out with a nina and a mack
I have you like Khia, my neck, my back

[50 Cent]
Ga ga G-Unit! (body) haha, yo, yo

I need no introduction, everybody (body)
Heard of 50 Cent, and heard of G-Unit
I'm not Hi-Tek and I'm not Kweli (Kweli) - you see me in the club
You better tell the bouncers to treat me special, I'm somebody (body)
Cause I get on that jet, in 5 minutes flat
Niggaz'll come back, shoot up your party (party)
If I don't have fun, nobody havin' none
I'm tryin' to holla at ya, come here shorty (shorty)
Shout out to my nigga Juvie, Wacko's here
Buck, my niggaz from New Orleans, wodie (wodie)
If we on the same page, when you see me on stage
You gonna throw your hands up, and you gonna applaud me (plaud me)
You know how I get, I'm still on that bullshit, nigga, nigga

[Tony Yayo]
I run around with the trey (body) pound like its a sport
And call my name in the bench, while I sit in court
I got a million dollar smile (body), and a fist full of pesos
And the wrist so icey, it could light up a stage show
In the club (body), nigga I stay holdin'
Cause I'm on point for them wolves, and sheep clothin'
I play the bar (body), with a double shot of Henny
Cause after this spot, its cheaters, and envy
(Shorty if you feel a nigga, call me) (body)

[Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, Banks, yeah
Look you ain't got to like me, that's (body) cool, I don't give a fuck
Clowny time ain't gonna put me in a bigger truck
Fuck kids, it (body) ain't my turn to be stressed
A bitch worse nightmare is a paternity test
I'm too young to be faithful (body)
If money means love, I hate you
I only trick on the first of April
Holla at me, if you thugged (body) out shorty ready to fight you
Dice, roll a blunt, and pull the snub out for me
And if your not don't even (body) call me

(*gun shot fired, yelling*)

Yo, niggas be askin me "yo 50 who you got beef wit?"
I'm a tell yall niggas who I got beef wit
I got beef wit any nigga I can't make no money wit
If I can't make no money wit you, fuck you nigga
G-Unit nigga, thats whatsup cause I said thats whatsup

[Tony Yayo]
I get money, money I got
so its a 100 grams or better when I'm going to cop
I never hold the toaster cause I use my little soldier
And my down bitch as a holster, like I'm supposed ta
heavy pistol sales for living
my gun rip through lungs and tear through tissue
while  I'm out for the ends, you out for a rep
thats the same thing that have yo mama in a black dress
see me in a black lex, hard-top
My mink drop-top, fresh out the carlot
I got the gift of raw pugilist speeches(?)
So I'm gon sell like the box office features
Niggas in the hood can't see G-UNIT!
but deep in they heart they wanna be G-UNIT!
cause we got them three b's: benzes, burners and bitches
and plus we on the road to the riches

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You can say what you want about me
As long as you don't get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out

[Lloyd Banks]
Lately I been going through a phase
Hope they aint tap the phones
Cause we got pumps the size of saxophones
Therefore I'm on the move with the squad
I'm stingy as ever, known to trick fast food on a broad
Picture me putting jewels on a broad
I'd rather put shoes on the car
A pool in the yard
You don't really wanna fool with the god
Nigga my front line long enough to fill two boulevards
In this game, you only make it far if you loyal
And if you grew up with your mother and your father you spoiled
Why swing, you gotta be strapped to get rid of me
Ill leave you in water like the statute of liberty
Tryin to be cool
Blowin green that strong enough to make a white boy open fire on a school
Keep rappin for your hood, I'm rappin for benzes
And long assault rifles with straps on the lenses

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Yall niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!!)
What I learned from Gotta Rock and Spank G (Un-Huh)
Yall niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!!)
What I learned from watching Brucie B
Look, I shot the sheriff
And nigga if you get too close yo punk ass getting shot
Here's the plan, I'm a keep stackin my ends
Till I'm on airplane seats in the Maebach benz
I'm all about the chips
I done took them trips
22's on the 6
26 on the bricks
And them outta town niggas, I'm chargin yall more
I tapdance on the shit I aint servin it raw
You sell smoke, look nigga I got what you need
But it aint goin cheap I got mouths to feed
Niggas always sayin damn 50 you bugged
Cause I got hoes giving niggas the date rape drug
Gimme his watch and his chain
We not the same, he a lame
He want pussy I'm bout my money man
Crap table in Vegas had his bitch on my dick
Threw a 7 so many times they thought the dice was fixed
Yo its 50, when your mindframe change and start to rearrange
I'll see you another day motherfucker it's 50
Shots 'til your heart drop and freeze up, ease up motherfucker

[Chorus]

I don't hesitate to pull out the burnin' nigga
I stick my snub nose in shit, that don't concern a nigga
I'm the reason that Coupe, ain't got no top
I'm the reason that Rouger, ain't got no shots
And when I squeeze, I tend to keep on squeezin'
If your lucky, you can run, and keep on breathin' (yeah)
When my knife hit ya windpipe and you start wheezin' (huh)
You put your hand over the hole, and it gonna stop the breathin' (woo)
I am what I am, and I ain't gonna change

Trust me, I'm not what you used to homie (grrr)
You little faggot, I'll tell ya fuckin' boss to blow me (uh huh)
I'm puttin' pressure on you, you payin' the pump (yeah)
About to die like a man, but you live like a chump (uh huh)

I can't wait to see you scatter, when I pull out and dunk ya (TAKE THAT)

[ Chorus ]
50, it's 50, it's 50, motherfucker (uh huh)

You spend a lot of time talkin about how you ball out

Why you screamin' war senseless, I'm tryin' to spaz
Swing my knife, tore break it off in yo ass
Niggas get hugged up in the huddle, I know how to clear 'em out
Four fifth, four shots, that'll fuckin' air 'em out
In the hood niggas love me cause I keep it real
G-Unit niggas, they gon' always make bail

[50 Cent talks till end]

[50 Cent]
I wanna be the reason you smile after you wipe ya tears
The reason you have the courage to confront ya fears
The reason there's two karats in each of ya ears
I splurge with the paper ma, I don't care
How you like it, pumps or boots, jeeps or coops
Minks or leathers, fifty fall off never
Whats mine is yours and whats yours is mine
So when I shine, you shine
The finest champagne, we can toast to life
Crap table in Vegas, you can toss the dice
Don't let ya fears let you confuse sayin' "fifty's bad news"
I need you in my life girl, your too much to lose

[Beat switches]

[Hook]
Nigga, you won't deny that I'ma fuckin' ride out
Then you'll bump heads wit me

That it ain't cool to fuck wit me

[Tony Yayo]
G-Unit, I roll wit gorillas
Fuck a big body guard, I hang wit pint size killas
I ain't tryin' to be dirty, still on the strip
I'm tryin' to be dirty, filthy rich
Give a nigga too much rope, he think he a cowboy
Give Tony too much dope, I'm pushin' the big boy
V12, SL detailed
I rap and wait for them checks in the mail
If you hatin', your due time life will expire
Cause my guns speak jamaican, they be like "Bloodfire!"
Where I'm from, niggas be on some sleak shit
They hungry, use they lighters to cook their beef stick
And this 'dro and this nestle got me right
So my lungs be as black as Wesley Snipes
I'm on first class flights heading towards Vegas
Ya slot machines niggas, we crap table players
I roll a seven, cause we crap table players

[Hook]
Nigga, you won't deny that I'ma fuckin' ride out
Then you'll bump heads wit me
I'll put a hole in yo ass, you'll see
That it ain't cool to fuck wit me

[Lloyd Banks]
I know a lot of niggas want Banks gone
My kind of beef will fuck up ya grill and not the kind you put franks on
I'm hidin' out, so my meals is home cooked
I deal wit more ho's than a chinese phone book
Your high with your messed up ratchets
I'm out blowin' haze bags the size of ketchup packets
Fuck who's in ya ride, there's tools on my side
By the females standin' with tattoos on they thighs
There's a lot of cats losin' they wives
Cause next time I see 'em, they got black and blues on they eyes
Nah, I ain't ready to die, but I'm prepared
But I'd rather grow old with grey hairs in my beard
They know me in the field, the kid with the fans
That argue over my balls like Kobe and Shaquille
If you talkin' bout millions throw me in the deal
Big city, stadium tour, ruining the bill motherfucker

[Male voice talking]
Right now with the situation gettin' better
So I'm doin' you things, holla

[50 Cent]
Yeah, 50 Cent, uh huh, check me out

I'm wild as ever, foul as ever
Reap whatever, whatever, whatever
They say I'm a slick talker, shit talker
Grimy ass New Yorker
Come gutcha, gum futcher, lay your ass out
If you ever catch beef nigga, call on me
If you fucked up in school nigga, it's all on me
I get a left foot to drop a nigga, pistol to pop a nigga
Break you off proper nigga, the cops ain't gonna stop a nigga (yeah)
Let's get this money man, them hos come with the paper 
I'm done to go wherever this game takes us
Look homey, you see my 22's, sittin' on low bros
That simple mathematics, that equal more hoes
I smoke a lot of dro, I got a lot of flows
Shit I didn't have to say that, ya'll already know

[Chorus] - 2X
From New York to New Orleans
A problem, holla at me

If everythin' is alright

Ya'll niggas can blow some trees
Have coke and some Hennessey
My niggas from U.T.P.
Everythin' is alright

[Young Buck]
For those who couldn't figure me out, what this nigga be bout
Cookin' it, and cuttin' it, and flippin' it, in 24 hours
I keep a dyke, on the back of the bike
In the summertime the white
Air Force One's, Louie Baton, Nike style (woo)
Don't really talk much (uh huh), I let my money speak
I know you saw us, shit we a 100 deep
I'm sippin' Don, with Juan, Bird, and smokin' weed
Shakin' them haters off, bouncin' to this jukin' beat
Fuckin' with 50, cause he strictly about head bustin'
Lettin' New York know these Unica niggas ain't stuntin'
Nigga we ain't runnin', I guarantee you that
After these messages we'll be right back
Take off that necklace a, because this tech will hit a
Innocent bystander who don't respect a nigga
After you finish your collard greens and cornbread
Get you a glock, and come around here where my mom stayin'

[Chorus]

[Skip]
From South I 95, 85, 65 right at the I 10, get your money widened
I got the Columbian, and I'm gonna hold 'em down
When you get close, call nigga I'm gonna guide you down
You got it now, (got it), well then what time you leavin'?
In a couple of hours, some time close to this evenin'
What us speed with V8, them cops then heated
They locked my partner Gus up for smokin' weed and speedin'
But he'll be home though, probably about the same time you get ya
Shit yeah, seems like we paid his bond like last year
But anyway, you know that thing we thought that was, but wasn't?
Well come to find out, my homey found somethin'
But he had to choke a bitch, and fo' pound somethin'
Cause I told him, what you told me about the chump and he chumped 'em
Put the barrel bottle pump, and pumped 'em
And pumped 'em and pumped 'em, and pumped 'em and pumped 'em

[Chorus]

So hurry up and copy and go selling nicks and dimes
Shorty she so fyne, I gotta make her mine
A ass like dat gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em everytime, punch 'em with every nine

They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme
Been on parole since 94 cuz I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did it three ta nine
If D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin dimes

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]
You said you a gangsta
But you neva pop nuttin
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long tyme
And you ain't got nuttin

[Verse 2]
Damn Homie, in highskew you was tha man, homie
What tha fuck happened to you?
I got the sickest vendetta, when it come to the chedda
And if you play wit my paper, you gotta meet my berretta
Now shorty think I'ma sweat her, sippin on amoretta
I'm livin once than deada, I know I can do betta
She look good but I know she after my chedda
She tryna get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gonna let her
Be easy, stop tha bullshit, you get your whole crew wet
We in tha club doin' the same ol' two step
Gorilla unit cuz they say we bugged out
Cuz we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 3]
Me I'm no monsta, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm jus me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no acta
But it's me you see on your TV
Cuz I hustle baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
If you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas sayin they gon merk 50 how?
We ridin 'round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR 15's?
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf beams, huh

[Chorus 2X]
QB NIGGA!!
Who I rep wit
QB NIGGA!! (repeat)

[Lloyd Banks]
Marsh' knows man
Talk tough, 'til you get cuffed and start tellin, damn~!
Everyday I shot a new bitch
And when I'm done with her it'll look like...

[50 Cent]
At first they didn't want me, now they want me
See a nigga gettin paid they wanna push up on me
You should see these hoes chasin a nigga
I have 'em in the hotel tastin a nigga
50 like a lollipop, lick me baby
Then lick Dr. Dre and Shady, OH~!

Yeah!
50 Cent, Lloyd Banks
Tony Yayo, G-Unit!

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
This rap shit plays a major part in my life
So if you jeapordize it I got the right (What?)
To send a motherfucker at you tonight (Uh-huh~!)
G-Unit!!

[Lloyd Banks]
And I ain't stoppin 'til my click poppin, swimmin in barrels of money
Ma can walk around with her head up cause her child ain't a dummy
It's funny - niggaz'd rather see you sufferin and hungry
I'm comfy as hell, skatin with another nigga's money (WOO~!)
You lie your ass off; you know you ain't that tough
I'm pullin your mask off, as soon as you act up (WHAT~!)
You know what I came for, a peace of the game or
Artillery that's 'bout as long as a chainsaw
I buy the weight, but it still feels like I'm dreamin
40 calender, my pillow kinda feelin my semen
The physical pressence of a female's the form of a demon
That's why I, fuck 'em and leave 'em get my nut while I'm breathin (YEAH~!)
If you thought they'd catch me slippin now I'm duckin and drippin
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you grippin
You trippin, no record can get my ass in position
Death wish for no religon whether catholic or christian
Listen; I went through momma bitchin in and out the kitchen
With probable cause as poppa was in and out the prison
We got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours
We got more four-fives and 9's then a deck of cards

[Tony Yayo]
You can take me out the hood, but can't take the hood out me (Cause what?)
Cause I'm ghetto (I'm ghetto)
Niggaz hatin when you do good, but when you broke
Your friends and your enemies they love you (they love you)
Chi-Chi, get the llello (get the llello)
Picture me bein cracked, out of town trips on the train - WHAT~?!
Chi-Chi, get the Yayo
Picture me bein cracked... (TONY YA-YO!!!) here we go
You can sniff me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie
I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin country
Wall Street niggaz, they cop me on a low
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow
It's time to go, on a bus, the train, a plane
I'm smuggle, I'm nuttin but trouble
I'll make your money double, cook me in bakin soda
I'll turn your who-rock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill ya 'fridgerator
Feed your family, turn your man to a hater
You can put me in the door panels or your stash box
Put me in your Nikes, Timbs and Reeboks
If you copped three and a half, you hustlin backwards
Cop a hundred grams, you movin forwards (what?)
I'm tryin to move more birds, in P.A. all day
On the corner of 3rd - nigga what?!

[50 cent)
You can take me out the hood, but can't take the hood out me (WHAT?!)
Cause I'm ghetto (I'm ghetto)

Picture me polishin pistols, I'm comin to get you, the shells hit you
You scream, think I'm playin - I mean it
Man I done brought all these pistols, let's get it poppin
Start to wavin my embroidered shell casings get to droppin
The devil's 'round the corner I got to much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket, just stunt and I'll pop it
I'm dyin to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you numbered for death
As the world turns, the lessons should be learned
Count all my blessings, clean up my weapons, I'm ready for war
The strong survive, the weak shall perish, I told you before
Hoes they compliment me now like 50 - nice chain!
Belagio, twenty grand of chips at the dice game
Ballin out, can't stop it, you gotta watch MTV
BET, nigga you see me~!!
I wonder if you mad, cause I'm doin good
Or cause niggaz feel me, more than you in yo' hood
And it hurts cause you love 'em and they don't love you back
Cause they know you just rappin and you don't bust your gat
You pussy!!

Yeah explain it to the niggaz in your hood nigga
They know you fuckin front nigga
Talk all that gangsta shit on the record; I see you nigga
Niggaz know me nigga; ask around in my hood nigga
Read the "Daily News" nigga you see them talk about me nigga
I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit
You pussy... get it poppin!

{NON-STOP... can't forget... Shady, Aftermath!}

[Young Buck] (chorus)

(chorus)

[Lloyd Banks]
Uhh Yea

But he don't wanna see me in the streets
Niggas get capped up, smacked up and killed
I like to do it gangsta style yea I do it for real
I'll be yo dentist get yo chest filled Wit bullets
Yea yo plan failed to ruin the G-units name
Lets do it like Trina and stop playin' games
I'm a spit heat flashes make you look like a lame
And when I head in the club hoe's give me they name
I'll do it like li'l' flip and say
You a lame so yo dame must be playin mind games
If you think you mess wit G-unit
Think about we go in the streets and handle our business

(chorus)

[Tony Yayo]
I'm back on that gangsta shit
When I'm in the streets y'all know who I'm wit
G-unit we kill niggas that talk shit
The Game has gotten so selfish
We the one's who put him on the map
Take this track rewind it like Boom Boom Clap
And you'll find out who's goin' get ya

I hope you figured out why we made this song
Cuz you really don't want to fuck wit us we King Kong

(chorus to a fade)

[50 Cent]
Yeah, I stay with my ratchet nigga
Go 'head and talk bad nigga
You best be on your best behavior out this motherfucker!
Ha ha

[Chorus: 50 - singing]
I stay gangsta'd up, niggaz ain't got shit on me
Annnnnd, I stay wit my gat, in case I gotta pop somebody
Geeee-Unit clique, you're blind if you can't see
That weeeee run the streets, nigga you better ask somebody

[Tony Yayo]
I got a rifle with a scope in the trunk of the Viper
So I shoot off the roof like the D.C. sniper
I just bought a bezel, and a brand new piece
And a level two vest and a brand new piece
See y'all hip-hop niggaz don't want no beef
Y'all get shot and rat to the hip-hop police
Nigga two guns up, I run up in your label
Why your guns in the house like a couch potato?

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
These hoes want me to stop, but this is the worst part
I was born with this game like birthmarks
I don't trip, but I'ma get a little watch from my modelin chick
Cause she spent a lot of time on my dick
I get a new fan every single time that I spit
Gray & blue Benz, lovin every diamond I get
Fast and fury in the Rang Rove' cause my bread folds
Beef I hit your neck and turn your jewelry into red gold

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I'm from the bottom man niggaz know I came up hard
I got a temper man I'm looking for some shit to start
Man my tax bracket change, I'm sittin on some change
The hoes man they changed they don't treat me the same
It's not my looks that's got me all up in them drawers
It's the new M3 with the Lamborghini doors
Man them D's they done turned them dogs into dopefiends
Smell a leak in my clothes so they barkin at me - WHOA!!

Yeah, that's gon' have to be good enough
I lost a friend tonight
Jam Master Jay... rest in peace
I send my love to his family
50 Cent y'all

[Chorus]

[Outro]
G-Unit, God's Plan!
Damn... {*gunshot*}

[50 Cent]
Hold up
Son them niggaz know who hit that nigga son (I know, I know)
They - how the fuck, we gon' know who hit him, and they don't know who hit him?
The hood talkin man, e'rybody know~! (I know, it's fucked up)

[Intro]
Now I lay thee down to sleep
Niggaz try and lay me down wit heat
And if I should die though before I awake
I pray my Lord my soul to take

[50 Cent]
If dead men could talk in your sleep your homey told you who got him
Would you have the heart to shoot the nigga that shot him? (Huh?)
Or would you start switchin upv
You thinkin 'bout the penitentiary and bitchin up?
What if he said money ain't everything, the hood raised us wrong
All jookz'll get your money long but look here I'm gone
Would that touch your heart? Have you feelin funny inside?
Would that be enough to make your punk-ass ride?
What if he gave you a little list of things to do?
Said he wouldn't have to die, he could live through you
Would you load the gats, and get ready ro ride
Or would you lock the door at yo' crib and hide?
It's a cold world even when it's hot outside
Whether sunshine or rain, you still feel pain
Hit him cause he was your strength, now you in a daze
Your homey turnin over in his grave... cause you PUSSY!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
"Y'all know who killed 'em, filled up" - B.I.G. {*repeat 3X*}
"Y'all know who killed 'em, filled up with the lugers from they Rugers or they Desert"
(RIGHT~!!)

[50 Cent]
Them boys smoked your homey, ye ain't gon' do nuttin back?
Not even if he told you you next to get clapped?
It don't take much for them shells to make the best of you
Your peoples gon' probably cremate and burn the rest of you
You done did too much dirt to try and make it to heaven
Nigga is you down for this 1-8-7?
When you reach the pearly gates, how you gon' explain
You gon' try and tell God you've been framed?
Y'all did everything together, he was your dog
Now you Uptown coppin, and he in the morgue
Them niggaz he gave packs to, they kept the cake
His sister and his baby momma talkin to Jake (uh-huh)
Niggaz that rocked him, they came to the wake
But they ain't come inside, they sat out in the ride
At the funeral, homicide all in the buisness
Walkin 'round askin niggaz to tell 'em who did it
Niggas is throwin blows now you ready to rumble?
Thirsty niggaz are animals, the hood is a jungle
Broke nigga'll body somethin over a bundle
Man a three-year-old kid in my hood know what a gun do

[Chorus] - repeat 'til 15 seconds left

[Outro]
Sha Money, XL!
Shadyville, teamwork, music

50 Cent; Lloyd Banks!

[Intro]
Nobody get hurt if nobody don't move
Just give it up smooth (G-UNIT~!)
Motherfucker you move I'll flash my tool
and blast my tool (G-UNIT~!)
Nigga you don't know me, and I don't know you
You think you know my crew (G-UNIT~!)

[Lloyd Banks]
I been a problem since the old days, pimps and gold caps
Now I'm in O.J. Simpson throwbacks
Y'all was wonderin where my ass been
Probably vacationin on South Beach gettin head like an aspirin
If you gassed, I can let the tec pound your ego
Or lock you in a closet with the West Nile mosquito
The press crowd in people, especially celebrities
I'm heavily shittin on any Tom Dick or Gregory
Nigga you better be strappin; they want you dead if you rappin
I'm tryin to cave your head and your back in
I'm gettin bread and relaxin, and attractin a fan base
of females with e-mails and letters to fax in
In Vegas with a toaster and a blunt
And the hotel I'm checked in, got a rollercoaster in the front
I'ma post 'em when I stunt, the Sammy Sosa of the month
Better yet the whole season, nigga I'm still breathin
Even though my dollars are green
I rap for the kids that's too poor to waste eggs on Halloween
I'm gettin swallowed clean, my habits are good
Collectin all the karats I could
Slidin from a stash spot to conceal the torture
And a good silencer to make it sound like the Wheel of Fortune
All this careless talkin, cause I'm travelin and flossin
Havin a good time, and you havin a abortion
You sucker for love, gettin married and divorced then
can't even afford the batteries for your Walkman
I'm out the hood, burnin Cali weed on Slausson
Where set trippin turn to tragedies and coffins
Look, I mean what I'm sayin, you schemin I'm sprayin
Your team end up layin, on the sofa screamin and prayin
Sayin, G-Unit niggaz be rollin crazy, holdin 80's
Older ladies starin cause they starin in that gold Mercedes
Since 50 hooked up with Shady, now they tryin to book up and pay me
If you think I'm shook up you crazy, baby
The boy strapped two ninas
Smokin out a bag big enough to fit on vacuum cleaners
I wore a glove when I blazed you fatty, I ain't your baby daddy
She flippin, now he tryin to grab me out the navy Caddy
I ain't your ave-y, papa was a rolling stone
Stockin up to own a home, pocket full of loaded chrome
Drop and get a hold of dome, I know your motive homes
You mad, cause I'm fuckin half your Motorola phone
I'm swift with the women I'm good with my words
A lot of, niggaz is hatin on what I deserve I'm hotter
Front if you want, end up on the curb in your Prada
And your mans runnin, ambulance comin
Another day another dollar, on the low from the Impala
I can have a six still in my shower, motherfucker~!

[Outro]
Nobody get hurt if nobody don't move
Just give it up smooth (G-UNIT~!)
Motherfucker you move I'll flash my tool
and blast my tool (G-UNIT~!)
Nigga you don't know me, and I don't know you
You think you know my crew (G-UNIT~!)
I send a nigga that you thought you knew
to come through and put a hole in you (G-UNIT~!)

[50 Cent]
Lloyd Banks, ha ha!
50 Cent! I ain't even gotta work hard
Look at these niggaz, ha ha ha
The fuck you gon' do now nigga!
You done had the same niggaz in the background for a long time
Think they gangster, but goin back and forth to jail
Well jumpin the turnstile don't count nigga
HA HA HA HA~!

[Chorus]
If you think you can fuck with this G
You got to be cra-zeeeee
I won't do a joint wit'chu, no matter how much
your label try an' pay meeeee
I'm on top of hip-hop, I run with Aftermath
and motherfuckin Shadyyyyy
It's simple, I see you'd like to be me
Y'all niggaz, can't fade meeeee

[50 Cent]
I could be a gentleman or gangster, the bitch done chose
Got semi-autos to put holes in, niggaz and hoes
My wrist all froze, for flicks I pose
Fiends sample my D's and those, I suppose that's about a 9
So far the grands stack for niggaz sniffin white lines
Sell anything under the sun to get mines, I'm gon' shine
Stunt for the summer, H2 Hummer, got paper now I'm picky
Change the rims, drape the watch, trade the Timbs, I upgrade
Now I'm paid - catch me in the Trump Tower lobby
Strokin other niggaz hoes is my hobby
Treat me like King Musabi baby, suck me baby
I roll with Shady and Dr. Dre, ohhhh~!
I'm down to, try my luck, see if I can fingerfuck in the truck
G-5, 50 so live
Soon as my zipper go down her eyes wide
Got her in the telly on the bed with her hands tied, wooo!

[Chorus]
If you think you can fuck with 50
You got to be cra-zeeeee
I won't do a joint wit'chu, no matter how much
your label try an' pay meeeee
I'm on top of hip-hop, I run with Aftermath
and motherfuckin Shadyyyyy
It's simple, I see you'd like to be me
Y'all niggaz, can't fade meeeee

  "Is this what you want?"
G-Unit, God's Plan!!

[50 Cent]
G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!
50 Cent nigga, Tony Yayo (yeah)
{WHOOOOOO... KID}

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Yeah! And you don't stop
I do a one-eight-seven on your motherfuckin block
Yeah! And it don't quit
It's G-Unit in your motherfuckin ass bitch~!

[Tony Yayo]
They say good things should happen to those who wait
But I'm stuck in the game still slingin weight
For that eggshell white, that tan and the brown
For a XL-6 or a seven four pound
Suede seats is hot but Italian leather is better
And with cameras in the mirror, nigga cars costs cheddar
I'm on first class flights, with flyin cooks
Cause my verse sound nice when they fly in hooks
Now I'm blowin weed yo, in Beverly Hills
With some bad freak hoes in the Montreal
Next year it's the new Hummer, stash box with the llama
I drive through in the blue data bomber
Heaven or hell'll prevail when I'm a goner
Cause I eat up tracks, like Hannibal and Dahmer
I'm the first one out, and last one on the corner
Cause life is a hustle, any day you be a goner
P89 Ruger, with the silence off
Let off a clip it sound like spitballs goin through straws
We got, plenty of ratchets but not on sale
We even got villagers that hold shotgun shells
These rappers is talkin 'bout bricks in they rhymes
You never did shit but some Mickey Mouse crimes
I don't respect it, my work is never watered down
So on the first I get mo' checks than Nike Town
Sling in thirty-one hundreds, I been on the block
Since niggaz did the snake, running man and the wop
When I was 15, I ain't want no workin papers
I played the strip all night, servin niggaz
Listen nigga, we live like Italians in jail
I got C.O.'s bringin cell phones to my cell
Get rich in the game, niggaz out to get you
Fill your ass up with led turn yo' ass to a pencil
I jumped out with the Ruger rapid-fire
I had you on the run like Omar on "The Wire"
I'm the only rapper you know that stay on the run
I'm the only rapper you know that stay with a gun
I'm a hustler, O.G.'s love to hate
Cause I got old school money put away in the safe
You can catch me in the hood where that dope and coke at
Or you can catch me in cali in the Hollywood throwback
I'm a bail jumper, you know them fish scale pumper
Fuck Judge Wong, he won't catch me on the corner
Nigga pay poor tax, homey you owe me
You wanna rap we can battle for your see through Roley
I be in M mansion, strippin them models
His bathroom's so far you gotta piss in a bottle
There's too many indians and not enough chiefs
Why you buy all the guns if you ain't got enough beef
The shit I spit'll cause an all out riot
And my new four-fifth'll cause a hollow-tip diet
I'm the type to tie up your lady, and gun butt your baby
I'm like the mob nigga, fuck you pay me~!
I'ma hide my assets, and disappear
Make a quick twenty mill' and vanish in thin air
I've finished my work now its time to cop
And meet that Chinese lady at the baggage spot
I need twelve 12's, and fifty-eight 58's
Cause I got eight sales and they all gon' wait motherfucker!

[Chorus]

YEAH~!
{Ha ha... WHOOOOO KID!!}

[50 Cent]
Yeah... 50 Cent, uh-huh
Governor, G-G-G-G-G-Unit~!

She ain't that chick from the burbs that's a stranger to drama
She that Uptown Girl with the cock at the sauna
Went out her way to let her know that I want her
I told her I - know fo' sho' we belong together
And I wouldn't break her heart, my intentions are better
And I, shared the same dreams she had about cheddar
When the D's came she was down to hold the baretta
I got a thing for babygirls, me and her against the world

[Governor - singing]
We used to think the same schemes, with the same dreams in mind
10'll bring you back 20 if the crook is on time
And she knows daddy loves to eat
Take a seat and let my baby rub my feet
She was a clear thinker, with a plan to rule the world
But understandin her place is my girl
Talk about hardcore, to win she'd give her life
Or shoot to kill, to protect this life

[Chorus: Governor]
The world will hear, what's really goin on, in my life - my life
The world will see, what was really down down, in my life - my life
If you only knew, the pain I feel; if you only could feel the streets is real
If they only knewwwwww, what's goin onnnnnnn, yeah~!

[50 Cent]
You're sunshine, your smile make my day
It's simple - your dimple your eyes
Your lips, your thighs, got me hypnotized
Communication's deep, I love it when we talk
Hate it when you leave but when you leave I love to watch you walk
You make a nigga forget about a life full of drama
She got expensive taste, she get it from her momma
Materialistic; still a nigga want her
Consistantly missin her touch when she gone, uhh
She smell like Chanel, she feelin me and I can tell
With the right woman by my side I feel like I can't fail
I've been around been up and down my attitude is fuckin ass
She a rider, I'm in heaven when I'm inside her
Workin up a sweat, kissin on her neck, "12 Play" in the deck
Fo'play correct, have her drippin wet
She looked in my eyes and say she like it but I know she love it
I just keep doin what I'm doin and think nuttin of it

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

{*abruptly ends halfway during the last line of the Chorus*}
"STOP!!"

[50 Cent]
Yeah...
She like it she love it, she kiss it she suck it
She want me to want it, she want to climb up on it
Smile, ha ha... {yeah, Lloyd Banks} (ha ha ha...)
50 Cent (yeah...) {*SHADYVILLE~!*}

[Lloyd Banks]
Mami we can, creep through the ghetto wit'cha, feet in stilletos
Hit the, club and party as long as you sneak in the metal (YEAH~!)
Or we can head to the house, from the house it's the floor
From the, floor to the couch, from the, couch to the door (WOO!)
Then it's, out to the store or, out to the mall
Watchin, out for the law, cause of this pouch full of raw
I don't care how much you love her don't, vouch for the whore
Cause the first chance she get I'm in her mouth on the tour (WHAT?)
I'm lovin the ladies, with no husbands or babies
Since little I've been active, lost dozens of babies (C'MON!)
Gettin a hummer stuntin, in your cousin Mercedes
Or roll up on you dumpin, pourin guns at your 80's (WHAT~?!)
You the man on your block? I'm the talk of the town
That's probably why they wanna see me in chalk in the ground
But you can find me on the corner with a pack of marijuana
Middle finger to haters nigga you fuckin with the greatest

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Yes, I wanna go, to a mo-tel
Just for fo' hours, only short stay
We don't have to go, far far away
To have some fun, try things my way
Bitch grab your bag, get in the Escalade
Put the seat back, we're onnn our way
There's no games to play, nothin else to say
Listen to your man, you'll like things my way

[Lloyd Banks]
You make me wanna, rest in the tower make a, mess in her flowers
How 'bout, sex in the shower or, neck for an hour (AOWWWW~!)
You got a ring on your finger even, one in your nose
Squeezin some on your toes, runnin your tongue like lobes
Ohh remember spin the bottle? You coulda been a model
While you begin to swallow, niggaz in Timbs tomorrow
No love, no hoes, no paper
Nah no ice, no Mo', there's no acre
Your bitch look good I'ma take her
Won't have to fight to make her the first -
{*abruptly ends*}

[Tony Yayo]
Mmm, yeah, uhh
Mind playing tricks on me man

It's a, regular day and a regular routine
'Til I hear this tragic news from about two fiends
Your man 50, just got popped 9 times
And I heard through the grapevines it's all cause he rhymes
In front of his grandma, I'm standin on the lawn
Wearin no Teflon, I wonder if he gone
I know in my heart I wanna cry
Havin thoughts in my mind is my man gon' die?
As I frantically run toward's 50 spot
I panicky peep like fifty cops
It was blue & whites, DT's and homicide
With yellow tape locked off on both sides
With four-fifth shells on the floor
And DT's ringin doorbells, goin door to door
Yo I'm stressed out, smokin bogie after bogie
Duckin the sarge cause the sarge fuckin know me
I jumped in Jeep truck and got a mac to spit
And we did about a buck cause Mary Mack I lit
at the time, I started thinkin back some shit
How we used to sling crack and stack our chips
With Kev, P-Low, Big Jewel the Kid
And my man 50 used to smack a bitch
And the good and the bad on the 1-3-4
And them hoes that we had on the Cash Money tour
Now I'm at the hospital, stop daydreamin
All I see is 5-5-1 and there's beefin
Baby moms is screamin, whole family grievin
But the word is, that my man's still breathin
I dropped to my knees and I thanked the Lord
And got a long shitlist all across the board
Motherf... {*ends*}

I love niggas, I love niggas~!
Cause niggas are meeeee
And I should only love that which is meeeee
I love to see niggas go through changes
I love to see niggas, shoot the shit
But there's one thing about niggas I do not love

[50 Cent]
Yeah... did it again nigga!

[Chorus: Notorious B.I.G.]
To all my Brooklyn	"Niggas!!"
To all my Uptown	"You niggas understand!!"
To all my Bronx		"In this world nigga!!"
To all my Queensbridge	"Swept you away.."

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick
and kicks it quick, you know how black niggaz get
with the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, makin crazy G's
Hittin buckshots at niggaz that open spots
on the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make 'em wet in they pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out

[Chorus: 50 Cent - repeat 2X]
We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel us nigga
Biggie yo' nigga, 50 yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigger, leave a nigga fa' sho'!
We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo' nigga, 50 yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigger, leave a nigga fa' sho'!

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Then we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A., cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North bound first stop, Watertown or Bitch-skill
Where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha hahhh, yo chief, pass the buddha

[Chorus]

[Verse: 50 Cent]
When I was young my M.O. was to go hand-to-hand
Even my P.O. she called me the Ginger Bread Man
I catch a new case, and tell her ass "catch me if you can"
Don't let your people fill you up wit octane, I'm not playing
Get gassed up to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it - thou shalt not fuck wit North C. Papa
50 Cent, I'll break yo ass off propa'
There's no place like home, New York - New York
I run the city, and I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they smacked silly or sprayed wit the Mac Milli
They don't want drama really
Pussy niggaz get hard lip syncin my lyrics like Milli Vanilli
In the hood they feel me {*gun cocked*} hah!! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit
Every bootlegger you know, pump my shit bitch!

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent - singing]
She said she love it, she like my muuuu-sic
She like that I'm thuggin, she loves G-Unit

[50 Cent]
What? Uh-huh; she feelin the kid
Baby girl you can push me, pull me, scratch me, screw me
Holla my name out while we fuckin on top
You can ride like a rodeo, oh you freaky and I know so
I'm with it if you like it in your butt
She's a working girl
Get on top and let me see you work it girl
Don't stop - get it, get it
You can ride 'til you're satisfied
Thought of your lovin in my brain make me sing in the rain
(Peep what she said)

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
She like my music... G-Unit!
WOO~! Yeah... G-Unit {NON-STOP}

[Tony Yayo]
Man anything goes when it comes to hoes
Ma your feet look good, let me suck on them toes
And if your body smell right, let me lick all them holes
I bust a nut in your face and wipe my dick on your clothes
Baby - spark the blunt and light the incense
Now it's time to freak off with my project princess
Y'all groupies wanna talk, and send fanmail
Cause y'all see me in The Source and the XXL (ha ha ha~!)

[50 Cent - singing]
Everybody wants to be real
Still they wanna hide how they feel
Nigga you're supposed to be real
When niggaz find out that you're tellin
Nigga you gonna get yo' cap peeled
Cause they get it, and now you know you gon' it
Truuuuuuuuuuuue, I know true thugs are hard to find
Just let me find you, f'real
I'll put a hole in yo' ass with the blue steel
Keep yo' punk-ass from tellin - HA HA!
Oooooh nigga you, tell on me
And you'll diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeee-hiiiiiiiigh

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]
I hustled then I got that ching ching ching
Then I bought my bling bling bling
That's how I got your fuckin bitch on my dick

[Tony Yayo]
You can catch me run inside nigga, doin my thing
Cause what I write with my pen got me next to Don King
I'm blowin H-2-O, in a H2
With a project chick named Rachel
I got rocks on my neck, with a big-ass piece
And come through in a Lex with Claudette Ortiz
With no roof on the top, that's my Sunday car
In the Hummer lookin hot, that's my Monday car
I got a stable of hoes, now I'm a P-I-M-P
And bring in bitches on a Amtrak with grams of D
We got beams on the gat, we detail our weapons
And the way that I rap, we e-mail addressin
Niggaz hear what I spent, and wonder how I write it
G-Unit gon' win, we on automatic pilot

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
With menage-a-trois' I got these dykes wet
Off of blue E pills with the knife checks
I'm still blowin green in the PJ's
Laid out in the cut readin screenplays, nigga be ea-sy
Don't talk grea-sy, the rap game needs me
I spent 16, you gettin charged by the freebie
Y'all niggaz in court, spillin the beans
About the kid from New York that be killin the fiends
I'm a H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler
I got 2 maids but fuck it I need a butler

[Chorus]

BITCH!!

[Missy]
This is a Missy Elliot one time exclusive (Come on)

[Chorus]
Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
  {*"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it" - backwards 2X*}
If you got a big [elephant], let me search ya
To find out how hard I gotta work ya
  {*"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it" - backwards 2X*}

[50 Cent] (Missy)
(REMIX) Unh Yeah
Now Missy she too much for me (I'm freaky)
She took me to to the crib man, she told me (eat me)
Now my babymama I told her ass not to beat me
Her broke ass wanna fight, Missy know how to treat me
She sitting on cash, she got money out the ass
Gave her them back shots and got money out her ass
Now you can see me in the coupe like WHAT
Next time I'll hit her in that G5 TRUCK
I've got the magicstick, I can go for hours
From the bed to the floor, to the sink to the shower
With her back to the bed and her legs to the sky
I can go hard, know why, big girls don't cry
I had visions of Missy with her money by the tub
Ching! Ching! Jackpot, I think I'm in love
I'm looking for Missy now so I can get my back rubbed
This the shit she hollered in my ear before we left the club

[Missy]
I'd like to get to know ya, so I can show ya
Put the pussy on ya, like I told ya
Gimme all your numbers so I can phone ya
Your girl acting stank than call me ov-ah
Not on the bed, lay me on your sofa
Call before you come, I need to shave my cho-cha
You do or you don't or you will or you won't cha
Go downtown and eat it like a vul-cha
See my hips and my tips don'tcha
See my ass and my lips don'tcha
Lost a few pounds in my whiffs for ya
This the kinda beat that go wa-ta-ta
Ra-ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
Sex me so good I say blah-blah-blah
Work it! I need a glass of wat-ah
Boy oh boy its good to know ya

[repeat chorus]

[Verse 2]
If you're a fly gyal, get your nails done
Get a pedicure, get your hair did
Boy lift it up, lets make a toast-ah
Lets get drunk, its gon bring us clos-ah
Don't I look like a Halle Berry post-ah?
See dem Belvedere playin tricks on ya
Girlfriend wanna be like me nev-ah
You won't find a bitch that's even bett-ah
I make it hot as Las Vegas weath-ah
Listen up close while I take you backwards
  {*"Watch the way Missy like to take it backwards" - backwards*}
I'm not a prostitute but I can give you whatchu want
I love your braids and your mouth full of funk
Love the way my ass ba-bump ba-bump bump
Keep your eyes on my ba-bump ba-bump bump
And think you can handle this ga-donk ga-donk donk
Take my thong off and my ass go boom
Cut the lights off so you see what I can do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Boys, boys, all type of boys
Black, white, Puerto Rican, Chinese boys
{??} thanga thang, {??} thanga thang
Girls, girls, get that cash
If its 9 to 5 or shakin ya ass
Ain't no shame ladies, do your thang
Just make sure you ahead of tha game

Just cause I got a lot of fame sup-ah
Prince couldn't get me change my name papa
Kunta Kinte, enslave a game, no sir
Picture black sayin, "Oh yessuh massa"
Picture Lil' Kim dating a pastor
Minute man, big men can outlast ya
Who is the best? I don't have to ask ya
When I come out, you won't even matt-ah
Why you act dumb like ughhh, duh
So you act dumb like ughhh, duh
And the drummer boy go pa-rum pa-pum pum
Give ya some some some of this Cinnabon

[Chorus]

To my fellas, ooooh
Good God, I like the way you work that

[50 Cent]
G-Unit (bo!) We in here (bo!)
We can get the drama poppin we don't care (bo! bo! bo!)
It's going down (bo!) Cause I'm around (bo!)
50 Cent, you know how I gets down.. down

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
What up, blood? (What)
What up, cuz? (What)
What up, blood? (What)
What up, gangstaaah?

[Verse One]
They say I walk around like got a 'S' on my chest
Naw, that's a semi-auto, and a vest on my chest
I try not to say nothin the D.A., might want to play in court
But I'll hunt or duck a nigga down like it's sport
Front on me, I'll cut ya, gun-butt ya or bump ya
You gettin money? I can't none with ya then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I.
I'm the type to kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit then they know me
I grew up around some niggaz that's not my homies
Hundred G's I stash it (what) the mack I blast it (yeah)
D's come we dump the diesel and battery acid
This flow's been mastered, the ice I flash it
Chokes me, I'll have your mama pickin out your casket, bastard
I'm on the next level, right lane forget bezzle
Benz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle, blood (what)

[Chorus] - (first time w/o first line)

[Bridge]
We don't play that, we don't play that, we don't play that
(G-Unit) We don't play around

[Verse Twi]
I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder
When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger?
When the fifth kick, duck quick, it sounds like thunder
In December I'll make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine
Any chick I fuck with is a dime
I'm like Patti LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own
Where I lay my hat is my home, I'm a rolling stone
Cross my path I'll crush ya, thinkin I won't touch ya
I'll have your ass usin a wheelchair, cane or crutches
Industry hoe fuckers, in the hood they love us
Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chuckers

[Chorus]

[Bridge] - repeat 4X

Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy, right?
I, I owe you for this one

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waiting for a track to explode on (Yeah!)
You can stunt if you want and ya ass'll get rolled on (It's Fifty!)
If it feels like my flow has been hot for so long (Yeah!)
If you thinking I'm a fuckin fall off ya so wrong (It's Fifty!)

[50 Cent]
I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven
Sittin politic with passengers from nine eleven
The Lord's blessins leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I ain't even got to try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at yo dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
Fifty fear no man, Warrior, swingin swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand writin lines knowin the Source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut wit a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone'll stop ringin again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Eminem]
If ya patiently waitin to make it through all the hatin
Debatin whether or not you can even weather the storm
Unless you lay on the table they operatin to save you
It's like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above

They think they crazy but they ain't crazy, let's face it
Shit basically they just playin sick
They ain't shit, they ain't sayin shit, spray em' fifty
A to the K get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fuckin mayhem, you stayin wit me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose wit this uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the messege? Am I gettin through to you?
You know what's comin, you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix em' up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killas tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put ya life in this, nothin like survivin a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Them cowards fucked wit the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children, its nuclear showers
There's nothin spookier
Ya now about to witness the power of fuckin fifty

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
If the gun spark I'll hear all of the shots go off
It's fifty, they say it's fifty
See a nigga layed out wit his fuckin top blown off
It's fifty, man that wasn't fifty
Don't holla my name

You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw you should watch yo mouth
Cause I'll break yo face
Have yo ass runnin, mumblin to the jake
You goin egainst me dog, you makin a mistake, I'll split ya
Leave ya lookin like the Michael Jackson jackets wit all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper
Yo bitch a regular bitch, you callin her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keeping her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in ninety four, gWe don't love them hoesh
I got pennies for my thoughts now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin lookin mean on the six
Niggas wearin flags cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood, they get filled up wit holes

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Lloyd Banks]
Man we gotta go get something to eat man
I'm hungry as a motherfucker

[50 Cent]
Ay yo man, damn what's taking homie so long son?

[Lloyd Banks]
50, calm down, here he come

[9 Shots]

[Banks and 50]
Ahh, ohh, what the fuck!?

[50 Cent]
Ahh! son, pull up! pull up!

[Intro: 50 Cent - singing]
Many men, wish death upon me
Blood in my eye dawg and I can't see
I'm trying to be what I'm destined to be
And niggaz trying to take my life away
I put a hole in nigga for fucking with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk, when you talk about me
Cause I'll come and take your life away

Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

[Verse One]
Now these pussy niggaz putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt, that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, something special happen every time
I'm the greatest, something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga, go'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

[Chorus - singing]
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me

[Verse Two]
Some days wouldn't be special, if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This if for my niggaz on the block, twisting trees and cigars
For the niggaz on lock, doing life behind bars
I don't see only god can judge me, 'cause I see things clear
Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means, with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggaz ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie?

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Every night I talk to god, but he don't say nothing back
I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggaz keep pulling techs on me
Psych says some bitch dumb, put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much, when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me, Tuck got knocked
I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate nigga? You can't read between the lines
In the bible it says, what goes around, comes around
'Hommo' shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here, for a real reason
Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fucking breathing

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go shawty, it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look mami I got the X if you into takin drugs 
I'm into havin sex, I ain't into makin love 
So come gimme a hug, if you're into gettin rubbed

[Verse One]
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggaz heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes, they wanna fuck 
But homie ain't nuttin changed hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut - hey nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood, in L.A. they sayin "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggaz'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm fully focused man, my money on my mind
Got a mill' out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feelin my style, she feelin my flow
Her girlfriend willin to get bi and they ready to go (o-kay!)

[Chorus]

[Bridge: sing-song]
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things 
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look nigga I done came up, and I ain't changed

[Verse Two]
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toastin to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryin to pull me back right?
When my joint get to pumpin in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin about money homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggaz hate then let 'em hate then watch the money pile up
Or we go upside your head wit a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin be

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither nigga
We in the club all the time nigga, it's about to pop off nigga
G-Unit

(Chorus)
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man I'm on some hood shit

Give me some dro, purple haze, and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man I'm on some hood shit

(Verse 1)
Everytime I ROLL up, niggas holla ROLL up, and I tell'em HOLD up,
You ain't gettin money you ain't smoking
In my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzos, smoking on indo
Hiiigh as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat, only if you got beef
Man you better holla at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Everytime I pop up, a lot going on in my hood

I shoot the dice, I holler get'em girls
Daddy need new shoes
Daddy need Perelli's to look mean on 22s
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny
The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semis
They was just harassing me cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)
But I- twist that la, la, la, la

I get high as I wanna nigga
Go against me, fa sho, you's a goner nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me, tell me you love me, don't stare at me man
I'd hate to be in the Benz clapping one of my fans
Let me show you how to greet me, when you meet me, when you see me
If you real my nigga, you know how to holla "G-Unit!"
There's no competition, it's just me,
50 Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I can go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Now who you know besides me who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffin on white lines
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach them how to buck them 380s and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib, sippin Guinness, watching Menace
Then Oh Lord, have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog
My team they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave nigga, go ahead get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot, so ain't shit you can tell me
Niggas calling me to feature, man fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good
I ain't got to write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood

(Chorus)

G-Unit, are you ready
G-Unit, are you ready
G-Unit, are you ready
Nigga, ready or not, here I come, come, come

(Skit)
"Aye you want some of this shit"
	"Naw, I don't want that shit"
"I don't give a fuck, I don't play dat shit"
"And I'm fin'nin to buss a cap in a nigga"
	"Man SHUT the fuck up"
	"Whoa slow down, slow down, slow down"
	"You see that brick house right there"
	"That's the nigga crib when he come out you gotta tighten his ass up"
	"I'ma get in the other car"
"Aight" {*a car revs up*}
{*gunshots*}

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If there's beef, cock it and dump it, the drama really means nothin
To me I'll ride by and blow ya brains out (brains out)
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you wit them thangs out (thangs out)
I do what I gotta do I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfuckin tape in court
I'll kill you - I ain't playin, hear what I'm sayin, homie I ain't playin
Catch you slippin, I'ma kill you - I ain't playin, hear what I'm sayin, 
homie I ain't playin

[50 Cent]
Keep thinkin I'm candy till ya fuckin skull get popped
And ya brain jump out the top like Jack-in-da-box
In the hood summer time is the killing season
It's hot out this bitch that's a good 'nuff reason
I've seen gangsta's get religious when they start bleedin
Sayin "Lord, Jesus Help Me" cause they ass leakin
When they window roll down and that A.K. come out
You can squeeze ya lil handgun until you run out
And you can run for ya back-up
But them machine gun shells gone tear ya back up
God's on ya side, shit I'm aight wit that
We reload them clips and come right back
It's a fact homie, you go against me ya fucked
I get the drop, if you can duck, ya luckier then Lady Luck
Look nigga, don't think you safe cause you moved out the hood
Cuz ya momma still around dog, and daddy ain't good
If you was smart you'd be shook of me
Cuz I'd get tired of lookin for ya, spray ya momma crib, and let ya ass look 
for me

(Chorus)

[50 Cent]
My heart bleeds for you nigga, I can't wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in ya eyes, I can see the bitch in you
Nigga you know the streets talk
So they'll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind, I'm down to ride till the sun burn out
If I die today, I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts that I've been in I'm by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now, shit changed motherfucker I can hire some help
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter fin'nin to get get shot it won't do 'em no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fuckin hurt when it rain
Oh you a pro at playin battleship well this ain't the same
Lil homie this is a whole different type of war game
See the losers and up in shackles of motherfuckin chains
Or laid out in the streets leakin out they brains

(Chorus)

[50 Cent]
After the fist fights it's gunfire boy you get the best of me (best of me)
If you don't wanna get shot I suggest you don't go testin me (testin me)
All the wrong I've done the Lord still keep on blessin me (blessin me)
Fin'nin to run rap cuz Dr. Dre got the recipe (the recipe, recipe)

Yeah, uh ha, aye Dre
You got me feelin real bulletproof up in this motherfucker
Cuz my windows on my motherfuckin Benz is bulletproof nigga
Cuz my motherfuckin vest is bulletproof nigga
Cuz my motherfuckin hat is bulletproof nigga
But the Doc said if I get hit I might get a fuckin concussion
Better that then a hole in the head right nigga, heh heh ha ha

Yea, ha ha, yea, yea

[Hook: 50 Cent]
If I can't do well, homey, it can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top
Fo sho I'ma make it hot, baby (baby)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I apply pressure to pussies that stuntin I pop
Stand alone squeezin my pistol I'm sure that I gotta
Now Peter Piper picked peppers, and Run rocked rhymes
Now 50 Cent, I write a lil bit but I pop nines
Tell niggaz, "Get they money right," cause I got mine
And I'm around quit playin nigga you can't shine
You gon be that next chump to end up in the trunk
After bein hit by the pump, is that what you want?
Be easy nigga, I lay your ass out
Be-lieve me nigga, thats whut I'm about, gangsta
You could find a nigga sittin on chrome
Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone (Yea!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent] + (Dr. Dre)
I'm down for the action, he smart with his mouth so smack 'em
You holdin a strap, he might come back so clap 'em
React like a gangsta, die like a gangsta for actin
Cuz you'll get hit & homicide'll be askin, "Whut happened?"
OH NO look who crept in with the FO'FO'
20 inch rims sittin on LOW-PRO
Eastside, Westside niggaz ALL KNOW, I'm LO-CO
Even my mama said, "Something really wrong with my brain"
Niggaz dont rob me they know I'm down to die for my chain
G-UNIT! We get it poppin in the hood
G-UNIT! Muthafucka whuts good?
I'm waitin on niggaz to act like they dont know how to act
I had a sip of too much jack, I'll blow 'em off the map
With the mack, thinkin it's all rap
Til that ass get clapped and Doc say "It's a wrap"
(It's a wrap, nigga)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I been feelin I have to teach lessons to slow learners
Go head act up, get smacked in the head with the burner
I dont fight fair, I'm dirty-dirty
I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga ya'heard me?
When streetlights come on niggaz blast the nines
Get locked up, they read books to pass the time
In the game there's up's and down's, so I stay on the grind
Niggaz on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
They aint nothin they could do to stop my shine
This is +God's Plan+ homey, this aint mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma; who always gotta throw her two cents
I'm the drop out who made more more money than these teachers
Roofless/Ruthless like the Coupe but I come with more features
I am whut I am, you could like it or love it
It feels good to pull 50 grand and think nothin of it
Fuck it

[Hook] - repeat 2X

Uh huh, hood make it hot

Come off, now watch your chain
Fo' I blow out your brains
Shells hit your chest go out your back mayn (back mayn)
See me I put in work, man I been doin' dirt
For so long when niggas get laid out (laid out)
Niggas run through my crib, to holla at the kid
That's when I start bringin' them thangs out (thangs out)
Then we go through the strip, hangin' up out the whip
Dumpin' clips off at they whole clique mayn (clique mayn)
When witnesses around, they know how we get down
So when the cops come they ain't see shit mayn (shit mayn)
My soldiers slangin' 'caine, sunny, snow, in sleet or rain
Come through the hood and you can cop that (cop that)
I'm sittin' on some change, G-Unit gots the game
Come through here stuntin' you get popped at (popped at)

[Chorus] 2x
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots but you don't hear me though

[Young Buck]
I came in this game knowin' niggas gon' hate me
Just for the simple fact they know that I'm a rida' (rida')
I got a hell of a aim, I keep on tellin' ya mayn
I swear ain't nobody gon' find ya (find ya)
When I get lifted I'm tempted to tear your block up
Your niggas can't run cause I'm behind ya (behind ya)
Me and Chilly in your city wit' a couple nine-milli's
You better stay in line bro' (in line bro')
Cause if I walk it I'll talk it, you know we'll walk up and pop it
I love the sound of gunfire bro' (gunfire bro')
Right now we smackin' 'em wit' platinum
And they hate it cause we made it, that's what we keep that eye for (that eye for)
I represent it cause I'm in it, UTP until I'm finished
Juvenile, they can't stop us (can't stop us)
And I admit it, I live it
I'll knock a baller off his pivot with this motherfuckin' choppa'

[Chorus] 2x

[50 Cent]
My twenty-inches spinnin', you always see me grinin'
And you hear niggas call me grimey (grimey)
They hit me wit' them bricks, and I ain't pay 'em shit
I'm outta town, they can't find me (find me)
When I come back around, man I'ma back 'em down
I run up bustin' that Tec mayn (Tec mayn)
If you ain't got a gun, and you can't fuckin' run
My advice is you hit the deck mayn (deck mayn)
But if you get away and come back another day
My soldiers'll leave you wet mayn (wet mayn)
Cause we know where you be, and we know where you stay
And we'll come trippin' through your set mayn (set mayn)
Man you heard what I said, now get it in your head
I ain't payin' no fuckin' debt mayn (debt mayn)
Cause you'se a middle man, but you don't understand
You'se a fuckin' fake ass connect' mayn (connect' mayn)

[Chorus] 2x

Yea, G-G-G-G-G-UNIT! (G-UNIT!)
Ha ha...

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely, 50 don't BACK DOWN
Everywhere I go both coasts wit toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that MACK DOWN
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fuckin hold SHAQ DOWN
Next time you in the hood and see an ol G
You ask about me, the young boy don't BACK DOWN

[50 Cent]
Any living thing that cannot co-exist with the kid
Must decease existin, little nigga, now listen
Yo mami, yo papi, that bitch you chasin
Ya little dirty ass kids, I'll fuckin erase them
Your success is not enough, you wanna be hard
Knowin that, you get knocked, you get fucked in the yard
Youza poptart sweetheart, you soft in the middle
I eatcha for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace
and your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his +Knight+ to be Suge
You can buy cars but you can't buy respect in the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectfu cuz to me you're a mystery
I know niggaz from ya hood, you have no history
Never poked nothin, never popped nothin, nigga stop frontin
Jay put you on, X made you hot
Now you run around like you some big shot
Ha, ha pussy...

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
"The rap game is all fucked up now! What are we gonna do now?
How we gonna eat man? 50 back around"
That's Ja's lil punk ass thinkin out loud
Southside, Tah died, that's just how I get down
I'm back in the game shawty, to +Rule+ and conquer
You sing for hoes and sound like the cookie monster
I'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers
All the other hard niggaz, they come from Yonkers
It's been years and you had the same niggaz in the background
You never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah, Crack child
Them niggaz dead, they just SUCK, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say "they like them in the hood"
I'm back better than ever, on top of my game
Even them country boys sayin "50 we feelin you mayn"
Now you stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne
I'm New York City's own...BAD GUY (BAD GUY)

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I ain't tellin anyone you pussy
I ain't tellin anyone you gettin extored
It ain't over.... (G-UNIT)
I've been patently waitin to BLOWW
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the "50 Cent Show"
This is my life, my pain, my night, my gun
Now that I'm back, you can't sleep
I'm a nightmare huuhhhh
You hired cops to hold you down cuz you fear for your life
You heard about them guns I done bought, right?
I ain't goin no where, I done told you nigga
I'ma G-Unit motherfuckin solider nigga (They not gon like you)
I know, I know...ha, ha (G-UNIT)

(Chorus)
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P
(Repeat)

(Verse 1)
Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her cause they wanna
I spit a little G man, and my game got her
A hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
Look baby this is simple, you can't see
You fucking with me, you fucking with a P-I-M-P

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
I'm bout my money you see, girl you can holla at me
If you fucking with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me, if you curious to see
how it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl we could have it all
We could really splurge girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up, if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, BITCH

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holla at a hoe til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless, me I got on gator shoes
I'm shopping for chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper
Man this hoe you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin know
You saying it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch choose with me, I'll have you stripping in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Nik my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your hoe out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six
Hoe make a pimp rich, I ain't paying bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shiiit, TRICK

(Chorus)

Yeah, in Hollywoood they say there's no b'ness like show b'ness
In the hood they say, there's no b'ness like hoe b'ness ya know
They say I talk a lil fast, but if you listen a lil faster
I ain't got to slow down for you to catch up, BITCH

[50 Cent]
(Uh huh) I know you like my style
(Uh huh) You like how I break it down
(Uh huh) I know you like style

Wanna get rich I'll show you how

On ya mark, get set, let's go, switch the flow
Teach ya how to turn yayo in to doe
The original don dada nobody bomb harda
Ya heard what I said boy, I'm hot, I'm hot
The hoodrats they say "He so crazy"
The snitches they say "He tried to spray me"
That's what you get for tryin to play me
The Aftermath and my wrath is so SHADY
No matter how you try you can't stop it
I catch ya stuntin in the Bentley Coup cockpit
If you a pimp why ya hoes stay outta pocket
Front and find out how my P-40 glock hit
[Yayo] "50 you need some help"
Chill Yayo I got this
Where I'm from the D's tryin to knock us
They swear to God that it's me sellin the choppas
Man I ain't give them lil niggas no product

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
(Uh huh) I know you like my style
(Uh huh) But how much do you like my style

[50 Cent]
The birds they say I got a way with words
I be like "baby girl I like them curves"
If ya not busy tonight then we can swerve
I'ma bachelor baby, fuck what you heard

From the tellie in ten minutes I'll make you a believer
Tongue touch ya'll have ya shakin like you havin a seizure
I make hits about what I do in my leisure
G unit gang, can't another clique out to see us
Niggas lip sync the lyrics cuz they wanna be us
Groupie hoes from the hood they be tryin ta G us
Try ta holla at the kid, e'ery time they see us
Girlfriend quit pretending I'm the nigga ya love
And I ain't got to say nuttin you know that I'm thugin
Put my hands on dat ass and ya say that I'm buggin
We family baby, kissin cousins
Now look what the riff raff done drug in
For the cheese my degrees is hotter then ya oven
I'ma New Yorker but I sound southern
And we sip DP till the Don stop bubblin
After we play, ok,  got to ya husband

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

[50 Cent (Tony Yayo)]
Em said you gone like my style
Dre said you gone like my style
I said you gone like my style (Uh huh)
You gone like how I break it down

You're not really, really ready (ready)

You're not really, really ready (ready)
My knife flip open and then I gets to pokin
You're not really, really ready (ready)
Them shells start poppin and bodies get to droppin
You're not really, really ready (ready)
You think ya ready, ya not (ya not)

[Verse 1]
I let my watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me, BOW! What up homie

My whip saying quit playing bitch get in
My earring saying we can hit the mall together
Shorty its only right that we ball together
I'm into bigger things y'all niggaz y'all know my style
Ya wrist bling bling, my shit bling blow
My pinky ring talk it say fifty I'm sick
That's why these niggaz is on my dick
Some hate me, some love my hits

See I'ma lier man I really don't care

You try and play me I'ma blaze it in
My chromes cost more than the crib ya momma raised ya in

[Chorus: repeat 2x]
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper now you can't tell me shit nigga
You can find me in the fo' dot six nigga
In the backseat fondling ya bitch nigga

[Verse 2]
New York niggaz, copy niggaz like it's all good
Fuck around we crip-walking in the wrong hood
I'm fresh up out the slammer, I ain't no fucking bama
I'm from the wild whody, but I know country grammar
See me I get it crunk, niggaz go head and front
I go up out the trunk, come back, rollout I'm done (yeah)
My money come in lumps, my pockets got the mumps
You see me sitting on dubs, that's why you mad chump
Don't make me hit ya up, 50 cent will split ya up
I lay you down, them carnids will come and get ya up
See 50 play fa keeps, and 50 stay wit heat
I can't go commercial, they love me in the street
I'm real bloody man, the hood love me man
Don't make me show up in ya crib like bro-man
Locked up in a pen, I still do my thing
C-O screaming shut the fuck up in the pen

[Chorus] (2x)

I'm in the Benz on Monday, the BM on Tuesday
Range on Wednesday, Thursday I'm in the hooptay
Porsche on Friday, I do things my way
Vipe or Vette, I tear up the highway
Shorty she can tell ya about my dick game
But she don't know me, she only know my nickname
Left the hood and came back, damn shit changed
These young boys, they done got they own work man

[Chorus] (2x)

[50 Cent - singing]
New York City!
You are now rapping... with 50 Cent
You gotta love it...
I just wanna chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe

[Nate Dogg ]
Girl... it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl... it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl...

[50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
would you poof, and disappear, like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap, you chill and drive
I'm askin questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin me?
In the bed if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

[Nate Dogg]
Girl... it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl... it's easy to love me now (Woo!)
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl...

[50 Cent]
Now would you leave me if your father, found out I was thuggin?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin?
Are you mad cause I'm askin you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate?  Cause if so, girl you're a blessin
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
and when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
would you believe me, or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes
To make it up I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I'll say anything to make you smile

[Nate Dogg]
Girl... it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl... it's easy to love me now

Would you still have love for me?
Girl...

Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us

[50 Cent]
I need you to pray for me (and)
I need you to care for me (and)
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading, 'cause I know where I've been

The flow is bone crushin', it's nothin'
I come up with somethin'
Come through your strip, frontin', stuntin'
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinners
Haters hate that I'm winnin'
Man I've been hot from the beginnin'
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm fittin' to catch a felony
Pistol in hand homie, I'm down to get it poppin'
Once I squeeze the first shot (gun shot), you know I ain't stoppin'
Till my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with, or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smokin', still locin',
what nigga, lay your ass down paramedics get you up feeling

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got somethin' for your ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy

[Lloyd Banks]
I done lost my bigger nigga, and I didn't cry
To young to understand, the consequences of a man
Livin' a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas, cause they funny   
20 years, of watching my mama's tears
Got my heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong, cause I need it
These niggas don't want me ballin', they want me buried
Balled in the dirt, from shots flurried
Layin' with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
'Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels, gonna call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flyin'
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm runnin' from nothin', my stomach is touchin', what I'm clutchin' 
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder, so I'm bolder
Hennessey and soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier

[Chorus 2X]

[Eminem]
These are my ideas
This is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my balls, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be
What you see on TV, what you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boopers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags, living fantasies
Frontin' like it's all fun and games, 'til the shoot'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playin'
Ain't sayin' we ain't layin' down at night and ain't prayin'
I bullied my way in this game, man I'm done playin'
Man I'm done sayin' that I'm done playin', I'm a start layin' into these
motherfuckering cocksuckers
There's no way I'm back down, like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man, bowin' to his knees
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whao, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you Marshall
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showin' you fuckin' old farts,
A whole other side, I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fuckin' marshmallow 

[50 Cent]
Unh, yeah..I like the way this feel right here
yo...turn me up in the head phones just a lil' bit
yeah..

[50 Cent + (Lloyd Banks)]
There ain't shit in this world deeper than loyalty and love
(Except loyalty and love, between thugs)
For you, I pull up in the whip and spray the whole strip
(For you, I walk up close and lay a nigga's kid)
For you, there ain't a damn thing that I won't do
I'm a Thug, this my way I show, my love for you
(Nigga for you, I get the coke, I'ma turn it into cash)
For you, if we go broke, we gon' rob a nigga ass
(For you, if we get knocked, I'ma have to take the weight
'Cause with a record like yours dogg, you ain't stayin' upstate)
Nigga for you, I kill a whole God damn crew (Why?)
'Cause I know you'd do the same thing too...haha
I ride, you ride for me, my enemies your enemies
How could you not love a Thug like me?

[Chorus]
Would you ride for me? (you ain't even got to ask)
Would you die for me? (nigga, they blast you, they blast me)
Would you cry for me? (shit, when I die I don't cry for me, just keep reppin' Southside for me)
Nigga, you ride for me? (you ain't even got to ask)
Would you die for me? (nigga, they blast you, they blast me)
Would you cry for me? (shit, when I die I don't cry for me, just keep reppin' Southside for me)

[50 Cent + (Lloyd Banks)]
(Nigga, I'm the stem, you the crack
I'm the clip, you the gat
I'm the glock, you the mac
I'm the artist, you the trap
I'm a pen, you the pad
I'm the Dutch, you the bag
I'm the knife, you the stab
I'm the driver, you the Jag)
I'm the ice, you the bezel
I'm grimy, you ghetto
I'm the bow, you the arrow
I'm the shell, you the barrel
I'm a pimp, you a player
I'm dope, you the hustler
I'm a nine, quiet me down, you the muffler

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]
You can catch me in public housing, wit' bundles of D
Or in the Santa Monica mountains, bundled up to ski 
Since, time is money, I rhyme on the clock
And walk through the strip with a nine in the ox
You seen the ice, you know it's top notch
And when it comes to dice, I'm seeing' shorty to the shot box
Banks stop, guns pop through your tank top
And leave you wet up like a sonar range drop
When I grind, I wear the same thing tomorrow
When you grind, it's Showtime at the Apollo
Damn near every rapper gotta hide sixteen
Well my flow's like a ho that's sixteen
I ran through niggas, dismantled niggas
They mad 'cause they see me in Cancun bitches
But I'm ghetto, straight from the 'hood my nigga
If there's no toothbrush I'ma use my finger
I got so many minks, and so many leathers
The crib is surrounded by animal protesters
I'm a grown man, still livin' like I'm young
With the mind of an old man, full of wisdom
Here the cops come, task force van
Rock so much ice, I'm called Jack Frost man
And while we sippin' on cris', you sippin' backwash man
Your team got heart, but your heart's in my hand
You want sixteen bars, in song format
Or sixteen cars on your mom's doormat...wha

[50 Cent]
Yeah.. 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo
G-UNIT!

[Lloyd Banks]
This rap shit plays a major part of my life
So if you jeapordize it I got the right
To send a mothafucka at you tonight
G-Unit! And I ain't stoppin' to my clique poppin'
Swimmin' in barrels of money
Ma could walk around wit' a head up and challenge you dummy
It's funny, niggaz rather see you sufferin' and hungry
I'm hungry as hell, skatin' with another nigga's money 
You lyin' your ass off, you know you ain't that tough
I'm pullin' your mask off as soon as you act up
You know what I came for, it isn't the game ball
Artillary that's about as long as a chainsaw (Lloyd Banks!)
I'm wide awake but it still feels like I'm dreamin'
Forty cal. under my pillow, condom feelin' my semen
The physical presence of a female, form of a demon
That's why, I fuck 'em and leave 'em
Get my nut while I'm breathin'
'Cause they thought they'd catch me slippin', now I'm duckin' and trippin'
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you rippin'?
You trippin', more records could get my ass in position
Death wish for no religion whether Catholic or Christian
Listen, I went through Mama bitchin' in and out the kitchen
With probable cause, Papa was in and out of prison
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours
We got more four five's and nines than a deck of cards

[Tony Yayo]
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me ('Cause what?)
Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Niggaz hate when you do good
But when you broke, your friends and your enemies
They love you, they love you
"Chi Chi, get the llello"
Picture me being crack, out of town, trips on the trail
"Chi Chi, get the llello"
Picture me being crack (Tony Yayo!)
You can sift me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie
I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin' country
Wallstreet niggaz, they cop me on the low
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow
It's time to go, on the bus, the train, the plane
I'll smuggle, I'm nothin' but trouble
I'll make your money double
Cook me in baking soda
I'll turn your Hooprock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill your 'frigerator
Feed your family, turn your man to a hater
Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox
Put me in your Nik's, Timbs or Reeboks
If you cop three and a half you hustlin' backwards
Cop a hundred grams, you movin' forwards
You tryin' to move more birds
...In PA all day, on the corner of Third

[50 Cent]
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me (what?)
'Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Picture me polishin' pistols, I'm comin' to get you
The shells hit you, you screamin' 
Think I'm playin'? I mean it
Man, I done bought all these pistols
Lets get it poppin'
Start wavin' my emboies shell cases get the droppin' (C'mon)
Like if it's down the corner, I got too much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket just stunnin' I'm stoppin'
I'm dyin' to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you know my contestants
As the world turns, there's lessons to be learned
Count all my blessin's, clean up my weapons
I'm ready for war, the strong survive, the weak will parish
I told you before, hoes they compliment me now like "50 nice chain"
Belagio, twenty grand in chips at a dice game
Burn out, can't stop gotta watch MTV, BET
Nigga you see me!
I wonder if you mad, 'cause I'm doin' good
or 'cause niggaz feelin' me more than you in your own 'hood
And it hurts 'cause you love 'em and they don't love you back
'cause they know you just rappin' and you don't bust a gat
You pussy

Yeah, explain it to niggaz in your hood nigga
They know you fuckin' frontin' nigga
Talkin' like gangstas on a record, I see you nigga
Niggaz know me nigga, ask around in my 'hood nigga
Read the "Daily News" nigga you see them talkin' about me nigga
I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit
Pussy, lets get it poppin'

G-G-Unit, G-G-Unit, G-G-G-Unit, G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit, G-Unit!

[Chorus: Brooklyn]
I still be riding through the 'hood
Brooklyn to Compton, it's all good
From Southside Queens to Inglewood
We representin' like we should

[50 Cent]
I'm hot boy, I told you before
Got that Benz and that Hummer off the showroom floor
I know you hate it when I pop up, wrist all rocked up
In The 'hood, empty niggaz locked up, they rats all knocked up
Baby after baby, the 'hood is crazy
Niggaz'll set you up and wet you up, trust me they shady
Got a pet bulldog, I keep under my linen
It don't bark, they spark when the revolver spinnin'
We winnin'

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Hold up, hold up, get a good look at my rims
God damn, look at them twenty-fours diamonds spin
Now the D's, they harass me in the 'hood
A few times, niggaz try to blast me in the 'hood
Fuck it's all good
Catch me in the coupe - on the lean
Wit' needles and samples and diesels for the fiends
The money stay on my mind, so I stay on the grind
Plus niggaz like to stun, so I stay wit' my nine
I ain't the type nigga that be out, runnin' his mouth
Talkin' gangsta and shit, with my gun in the house
Now homie, you better get to know me better
Before you be leakin' pints of blood into Iceberg sweater
When the tails come flyin' up out the beretta
You gon' feel like it's yo' fault and say "Man I knew better"
Look dogg, I don't play that shit
I pull that thing out I'ma spray that shit
That how I get down

[Brooklyn]
Brooklyn she's so sick in the hood
Got these fat bitches get the spit in the hood
Cause I throw diamonds, shot that fifth in the hood
That's what you get for talkin' all that shit in the hood
Yeah I'm still a minor, remember this
Everything Brooklyn choppy broads still behind ya
Brooklyn to Compton it's all good
Get robbed, get shot, shit is poppin' in the hood

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[50 Cent]
Niggaz screw they face up at me
On some real shit son they don't want beef (nah)
I cock that, aim that shit out the window and spray
There ain't a shell left in my heat
Y'all niggaz better lay down, yeah I mean stay down
You get hit with AK round, your ass ain't gon' make it
You niggaz'll get laid out, your blood and your brains out
Have you on the concrete ship already sinkin
I'm from Southside motherfucker, where them gats explode
If you feel like you're on fire, boy drop and roll
Niggaz'll eat yo' ass up, cause they heart turned cold
Now you can be a victim or you can lock and load
The party jump, shorty bouncin that ass, I want her
Gimme a second I'ma holla I'ma see whassup
I got my razor in my hand, got my pistol in the trunk (uh-huh)
Carve your ass up nice you play me like a punk

[Chorus: 50 Cent singing]
In my hood - niggaz got love for me
But I don't go nowhere without my strap
In my hood - a little 'dro, a little Hennessy
and niggaz just don't know how to act
In my hood - niggaz is gri-mey
I stay on point, I roll with my gat
In my hood - niggaz might buck at me
So I keep somethin around to buck back

[50 Cent]
In my hood... I don't trust a muh'fuckin soul
When the D's come they fold, on my first case they told
Where I'm from it ain't safe to have more than a eighth
Niggaz'll come to your place, put a gun in your face
Tell you open the safe, as your heart start to race
Cause a robbery could turn into a homo' case
Co-operate, or Doc'll have to operate
Niggaz I'll pop you, run a light then pop at Jake
Trust me son, niggaz'll go hard for that cake
These thirsty niggaz are lurkin, you'll have to catch 'em and merk 'em
I'm observin in my hood, cause niggaz be dumbin
Shots forfeit the dice game, all you see is the runnin
They make it harder and harder to pump on the block
I'm a hustler, how the fuck I'm 'sposed to eat when it's hot?

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
In my hood - the house party off the hook until them shots go off
Well that's what you get for stuntin on my block showoff
Up, you shit out of luck if niggaz catch you slippin (uh-huh)
Crack money slow so you know niggaz is trippin (yeah)
Shorty down there on that Queens tracks takin a whippin
Sheeit, bitch get out of pocket, she need some discipline
Peep the fiend shootin diesel in his arm in the alley (ahh)
Look at the chrome spinner spinnin on that black Denali
The grimey niggaz where I'm from don't wanna see you chipped up
You shy nigga on jux, you about to shoot your whip up
It ain't good to do good in my hood
{*click-clack, BLAM*} You know not to do good now

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
In my hood...
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, who's heart's Jello, 'cause

[Chorus 2X]

Shady Aftermath nigga, G-Unit, rap juggernauts of this shit, we takin' over
(Chorus)
I gotta make it to heaven, fuck going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven, fuck going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven

Some say I'm paranoid I say I'm careful how I choose my friends
I been to ICU once, I ain't going again
First D got murked, then Roy got murked
And homey still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt

I smell somethin' fishy man it might be a rat
Damn niggas switchin sides on niggas just like that
You know me, I stay wit a bitch on her knees and give guns away in the hood
like its government cheese

Spray off Suzuki's eleven hundred cc's
No plate on the back, straight squeezing the Mac
In the hood they identify niggas by they cars
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar

I ain't gotta be around to make shit hot
I send Yayo to dump 30 shots on ya block
So spray dat Tec nigga if I say get it done
An make it wet niggas if you round me son

2 x (chorus)

When I come through the hood, I don't stop to rap ta niggas
Get close enough to smack you then clap you nigga
Pac tried to front so I waved the chrome at his ass
Point blank range I spat and threw a bone at his ass

Two weeks later niggas came through with Mac's to lay me down
They sprayed I played Dead and got the fuck off the ground
Out the blue I get a phone call g50 wadduph
they sent a bitch at me I sent the bitch back cut up

I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you boy
Front on me, you gon meet one of my soldiers boy
Cousin twin shot up his mamma crib now he in Jail
Trippin on Fliks of Blu Cantrell pussy in black tail

Pac mamma moved, but she don't talk to him no more
The shells from twin 4-4's, blew the hinge off her do'
Without that check every month how she gon pay for the crib
Man social service finna come an take dem kids

2 x (chorus)

Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
the courage to change the things I can
the wisdom to know the difference
In AA they make you say that
that's the prayer they burn in your head when you a case act

Man I might talk to you while we up in them pens
but when we come home that don't mean we goin' fuckin' be friends
Shells scratch ya head close enough to hear 'em whistling
Thank god they missed you, an go grab ya pistol

In the hood niggas runnin' round actin' crazy
Buying little air Jordans for maybe babies
See it might be his, and it might be yours
Cause them broads in the projects is straight up whores
Man it don't take much for you to get in them draws
You can have 'em on they back or on all fours

You ain't got to tell me, you feelin' this shit
cause I hear what I'm sayin' I know I'm killin' this shit

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I, don't know what you take me for
I, really don't play that shit
I, ain't got to get you hit
I get out myself and spray that shit

[Verse One]
I got a itchy-itchy trigger finger, nigga it's the killa in me
not to spray this shiiiiiiit
I got enough ammo shots to blow I put a hole
in any motherfucker out this biiiiiiitch
I unload to reload when you get hit I suppose
you gon' be strong enough to take this shiiiiiiit
I'm in the hood ridin 'round with a fo'-fo' pound
Can you see through the limousine tiiiiiiints?
I do dirt, the gat bust, I get to kickin up dust
'fore the Jakes come around here kiiiiiiid
Niggaz get knocked if D's start askin question
My name end up in all types of shiiiiiiit
I'll be a gangsta nigga 'til I die fo' sho'
Whether I'm po' or I'm filthy riiiiiiich
Now what you know about movin that Peruvian flake
for that cake, I get rid of dem briiiiiiicks

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Verse Two]
Now I gotta have shoes, you know chrome 22's
Every time I get a brand new whiiiiiiip
I rode around in the 5 'til my money got right
Then I went back and got that siiiiiiix
I'm in a big white Benz on a hot sunny day
I call it the milktruck an' shiiiiiiit
I'll have your hoe eyeballin at the light damn pimpin
You should take time to check that biiiiiiitch
If I'm ridin through the hood actin like it's all good
but I'm lookin for jux an' shiiiiiiit
In the middle of the night, you can turn on the light
Find me and my niggaz in yo' criiiiiiib
Nigga holla if there's a problem and yo' niggaz got drama
I got burners for sale and shiiiiiiit
Got them macs, got them 9's, got them techs full of dime
Hollow-tips and them extra cliiiiiiips

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Verse Three]
Man I'm tired of tellin niggaz over and over
E'rything about me be gangsta
Man I'm tired of tellin niggaz over and over
I won't hesitate to pop or shank ya
Man I'm tired of tellin niggaz over and over
They can't hustle when I'm in this shit
Man I'm tired of tellin niggaz over and over
You don't listen, you gon' get yo' ass hit

"This is 50"

Yeah!  Nigga cherish me
Like the water you drink
Like the air you breathe
You need me to live
Yeah

[50 Cent]
Ah-ha man!  Ay you know where them niggaz be at right?
{*click-clack*} Take me to 'em

[Chorus: 50 singing]
All through the hood I keep hearin niggaz sayin
- I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggaz done put a hit out and they talkin like the shit okay
- I'm down to ride tonight
We rollin, whip stolen, AK loaded
- I'm down to ride tonight
Weed smokin, straight loc'n, lockin loadin
- Somebody gon' die tonight

[Verse One]
This is nuttin new, I been in this position before
Grandma crib, niggaz outside of her door
Different day same shit, old mac new clip
32 hollow-tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggaz never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin, I'll have 'em tongue-kissin my tec
Gwan come, test me, pussy bwoy, don't try it
Police response never fast enough to shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin with son
'Fore we find out where yo' bitch get her hair and nails done
It's elementary, life is but a dream
You know row row your boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or yo' life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said, "Damn - niggaz wanna stick me for my paper"
"And pray for my downfall," I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that Kevlar and vest shit, that wild wild West shit
There's eighty-one one carat stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make motherfuckers wan' kill me
Every projects in every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, and my mob ain't with me
You can bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin on me'll shorten your lifespan
Hold the mic with my left, my knife in my right hand
YEAH!

[Chorus]

{*sounds of gunshots and people screaming, tires peel out*}

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Clickity-clank, clickity-clank
The money goes into my piggy, bank
Clickity-clank, clickity-clank
The money goes into my piggy, bank

[Verse One]
Man I'll get at you - my knife cuts your skin
I'll get at you - blow shots at your man
I'll get at you - dupe I don't pretend
I'll get at you - I'll put that to an end
That damn shit is old, don't be screamin "Get at Me Dog"
Have you runnin for your life when I match ya part
I get to wavin that semi like it's legal
A lil' nigga hurt his arm, lettin off that Eagle, you know me
Black on black Bentley, big ol' black 9
I'll clap your monkey-ass, yeah black on black crime
Big ol' chrome rims gleam, you know how I shine
C'mon on man, you know how I shine
I'm in the hood, in the drop, Teflon vinyl top
Got a 100 guns a 100 clips, why I don't hear no shots?
That fat nigga thought "Lean Back" was "In Da Club"
My shit sold 11 mill', his shit was a dud
Jada' don't fuck with me, if you wanna eat
Cause I'll do yo' little ass like Jay did Mobb Deep
Yeah homey in New York niggaz like your vocals
But that's only New York, dog yo' ass is local

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah get more money, more money
Yeah - yeah, yeah get more money, more money
Yeah - yeah, yeah get more money, more money
Yeah - yeah, yeah get more money, more money

[Verse Two]
Banks' shit, sells; Buck's shit, sells
Game's shit, sells; I'm rich as - hell
Shyne poppin off his mouth from a cell
He don't want it with me, he in P.C.
I could have a nigga run up on him with a shank
For just a few pennies out my piggy bank
Yayo bring the condoms, I'm in Room 203
Freak bitch look like Kim before the surgery
Send emergency, for Michael Jackson see
You'll picture and say she looks like me
Kelis said her "Milkshake" bring all the boys to the yard
Then Nas went, and tattooed the bitch on his arm
I mean like way out in Cali niggaz know you cuz
First thing they say about you is youse a sucker for love
This is chess not checkers, these are warning shots
After your next move I'll give you what I got
YEAH

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Outro]
When I get at you - I'll punch out your grill
I'll get at you - let off that blue steel
I'll get at you - nigga I'm f'real
I'll get at you - could get yo' ass killed
YEAH!  Yeahhh... hahahaha!
Y'all niggaz gotta do somethin now man
All the shoot 'em up shit y'all be talkin
You gotta do somethin baby!
I mean, I mean c'mon man everybody's listenin
Nigga e'rybody listenin
Hahahahaha!
I know you ain't gon' just let 50 do you like that
I mean damn, rep yo' hood nigga
Nigga you hard right?  Pop off
Yayo, get mobs of them niggaz on the phone
Tell niggaz I said grip up
Niggaz got a green light on these monkeys
Hahahahaha!

[Em] Gee wilikers Gatman they got me surrounded
[50] I'm on my way

[Chorus - 50 Cent & Eminem]
I got a gat man
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a black bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed
They say Batman

[50 Cent]
Robin, Cagney and Lacey, it's 50 Cent and Shady
The worst baby, put your hands on my people I'll react crazy
Put a hole through ya front and ya back maybe
But dude if you try me, I'll have ya ass hooked up to an IV
I'll leave no witnesses when I ride B
You fuck with me, you'll see
I'll react like an animal, I'll tear you apart
If a masterpiece was murder, I'd major in art
Niggaz knew I wasn't wrapped too tight from start
But bein' a little off, landed me on top of the charts (whoo)
So you take the good with the bad, I guess
Level three Teflon plate on my chest
And my cock back hollow tip in the chamber
Danger, anger will change ya
And make ya aim that and squeeze

[Chorus 50 Cent & Eminem]
I got a gat man
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man

[Eminem]
Motherfucker, you retarded you touch 50
I'll leave you dead, leave you dearly departed
We're walkin' away from a beef, in which clearly you started
I said we're walkin' away, did you hear me you wanna be thankful
That we ain't beefin' we're still breathin' and just leave it at THAT
Cause if me and 50 and G-Unit hop back in that BAT mobile
It ain't gonna be no more rappin', it's gonna be BRAAAAT [gunshot sound]
Retaliation will be like them muslim Shi'ite ATTACKS
Some where along the line, its like me and 50 made a PACT
He's got my back, I got his, back
It's almost like we're kinda like Siamese twins
Cause when we beef we pull each other in
to the bullshit like we're conjoined at the hip
It's just unavoidable some of this shit is washable
And some shit will never boil up
And some of it will just simmer at best
If left alone, we'll let it be so there won't be no sit downs
With no Ray Benzinos, there will no peace discussions with me
There ain't gon' be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fuckin' with me and I'll gladly quit fuckin' with you
Just spit ya sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through
Without mentionin me and the machine or Jimmy Iovine and Dre and 50
or D-Twizzie, Obie and just let it be or we'll be back with a

[Chorus - 50 Cent & Eminem]
I got a gat man
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed

[Verse 3 - 50 Cent]
Nigga you get it twisted, you can get ya wig splitted
I don't give a fuck, I don't care if police know I did it
Man I hustle, I get money, in the sunshine or a blizzard
I go hard for that paper, homie I just gotta get it
Got a money scheme, I'm plottin' in the county and I'm with it
You cross me and you gon' make a cemetery visit
That's gangsta, you know me I told it, cause I live it
Shell cases drop, when that chopper chop
Way up the block, get hit with copper tops
When drama pop, the llama pop
And it won't stop, you can run, call the cops
They say no, nigga's know how I be on it
That shit you got, put my pistol to you I want it
Its not a game, perfect aim you feel the flame
Up against ya brain, man it's so hot I'll make ya wish it rained

[Chorus - 50 Cent & Eminem]
I got a gat man
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed

[Intro - 50 Cent]
Yeah
Uh huh
So seductive
 
[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead girl, don't you stop
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Chorus - Olivia (50 Cent)]
I'll take you to the candy shop (yea)
Boy, wanna taste what I got (uh huh)
I'll have you spending all you got (c'mon)
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Verse - 50 Cent]
You could have it your way
How do you want it?
You gonna back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature rising, ok
Let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a tea kettle
I break it down for you now, baby it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teaching you about how strong I got you
When you show me what you working baby, No problem
Get on top, get your bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet, when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm trying to explain baby, the best way I can
I melt in your mouth girl, not in your hand (uh huh)
 
[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead girl, don't you stop
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Chorus - Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, wanna taste what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Bridge - 50 Cent (Olivia)]
Girl what we do (what we do)
And where we do (and where we do)
The things we do (things we do)
Are just between me and you, yea (oh yeah, yea)
 
[Verse - 50 Cent]
Give it to me baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
Cuz I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door, she kept pulling on my zipper
It's like a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs
Had me thinking about that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow mo on the floor when we grind
No she ain't stopping homie and I ain't stopping
Dripping wet with sweat, man it's on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gonna sip that heavy bubble man, every bottle is gone
 
[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead girl, don't you stop
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Chorus - Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, wanna taste what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead girl, don't you stop
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Chorus - Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, wanna taste what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa

[50 Cent]
Yeah, Shady, Aftermath

Every-body's - on the floor
Goin goin outta control
Set it off on yo' left, dog
Set it off on yo' right, dog
Set it off
Nigga I said set it off! (Set-set-set set it off)

[50 Cent]
Ha ha...
Sick with it, boy better get with it, what?
In the club I get it goin, goin, uh
Just movin to the music it's on
And the sounds of 50 and D-R-E
Everything's calculated and sound precise
Another move another mill', let's get right aight?
Success is my drug of choice, I'm high off life
Feelin lucky enough to bet it all on the dice
Shorty do what you wanna do, hit the dancefloor
And move how you wanna move, later on
we can cruise if you wanna cruise, it's whatever you want
The fact is I got more than I flaunt, yeah

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I do my thang, in the club
Every chance I get, I tear it up
Dancefloor jampacked, look
I got 'em goin goin outta control
Set it off on yo' left, dog
Set it off on yo' right, dog
Set it off
Nigga I said set it off! (Set-set-set set it off)

[50 Cent]
System thumpin, dancefloor jumpin
We 30 deep in this bitch, we stuntin
That's what you get, you in my hood
"I thought you understood" - you know me
V.I.P., no ID
Bottles of DP, I do it real B-I-G
Bitches break their neck to be where I be
Take 'em to ecstasy, without ecstasy
I'm a chef you need the hit I got the recipe
Doc got the antidote, it's in the drugs and the notes
Can you feel it?  Em said for me to make you feel it
And remind you that you rockin with the realest

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I'm hot boy, I'm burnin up
I do my thang in the club with the burner tucked
'Til the speakers all blown, we gon' turn it up
And do that damn thang, yeah do that mayne
Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
Get to poppin and shakin that thing on the flo'
A little dose of it, now I want some more
Nobody put that thang on me like that before
I be a fiend for it, it's the way you move
But I ain't payin for it, cause I ain't no fool
If you okay with it, tonight I stay with it
Hit the telly play with it in a major way get it

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Uhhhhh
Yeah
Uhhhhh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm a straight guerilla with it, cold hearted killa wit it
Any nigga gettin' outta line can get it
I make it hot, motherfuckers freeze up when I come through
Mac-10, thirty two shot clip in my snorkel
I might smile and say whats up but I don't fuck with you niggaz
My rap money slow up, I'll run up on you niggaz
I'm on the edge, I'm just waitin' on a nigga to push me
Put my hand on my strap, what you lookin' at pussy
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
So much chrome on my Benz, you see ya face in my rims
If your bitch wanna roll, I'ma let her get in
I don't play but I'm a playa till the motherfuckin' end {*gunshots*}

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I got no pickup lines
I stay on the grind
I tell the hoes all the time
Bitch get in my car (Bitch get in)
I got my 64, ridin' on Dayton spokes
And when I open that do'
Bitch get in my car

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me you don't know that, uhh I'm the shyiiit
Now you better watch ya girl mayn, I leave with ya bitch
I ain't ?? these hoes, man I'm bout my paper
If your bitch really bout it nigga I'm gon' take her
Backseat of my jeep, fuck till I fuck up her make up
Take her to the Diamond District, introduce her to Jacob
Tell her if she like me she should keep me icey
My game fuck with a bitch brain till she think she wifey
Spent a life savings in a day, cause she likes me
Committment for me, uhh nah not likely
One hour, Vivica, I thought I was onto somethin'
But then the next week, nah man it was nothin' {*gunshots*}

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Look into the windows of my soul, the eyes never lie
They blood shot red, its gaunja in my system, I'm high
First its pain when you lust for love, then its smooth and calm
Feel the rush, like a needles in your arm
Its a cold world baby girl, lovin' me is not enough
Find out when you fuckin' broke, love won't get you on the bus
Man you should see the pretty bitches that be sexin' me
They suck cock that make 'em hot, I just let 'em stand next to me
Hundred percent thug, freak too, I'll taste your love
69's the position, your mouths full baby huhhhh?
My conversations so deep, I get in your head
Next thing you know, you yawnin', turnin' over and I'm in the bed {*gunshots8}

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Hahaha
Quit playin' bitch get it
You know you wanna ride with a nigga
50 Cent
G-G-G-G-G-Unit
{*gunshots*}

[50 Cent]
Yeah, I'm tryin to catch me somethin
A little jux or somethin

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Nigga that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, move I'll break you off properly
I get mine the fast way, the ski mask way
Make money, make money money money
Nigga if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money money money

[Verse One]
You wan' spray at me go 'head; the last nigga that tried
got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Your lil' sister callin me stupid, reason why
her and your momma in the living room now hogtied
I came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait
Got a brand new cig in that ol' 38
I be schemin to put a lil' bread on my plate
Watch and dressers, look through a hole in the cake
I stick a nigga for his sign, sell him back the next day
You thought I really wanted your pussy?  Bitch please
This is stashhouse, jackpot, there go them ki's
My black G-Unit hoodie just wreak with marijuana
Cocaine comin out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious man, I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career
Make money, take money, yeah nigga, YEAH

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Who's that peepin in my window - WOW, the feds on me now
They know when I'm sleepin, they know when I'm wake
I know they got my phone tapper, I'm screamin fuck Jake
I'm tryin to stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad News, VA - now that sounds great
I see niggaz with that ice on, rims shined up
This town's one big pussy, waitin to get fucked
I holla at AI peoples to get gats
They charge me 500 apiece for two macs
Then I'm back doin me, I'm back out on the spree
Catch me a nigga slippin out pumpin that D
Get me a little crew I'll have 'em pumpin for me
The more product I take the more paper we see
Change my name, in NY they don't know where I be
Yeah a nigga doin dirt but a nigga low-key

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
She loves me, she loves me not (yeah)
She loves me not

The fiends need me
I aint around, they bones ache
Detox, rehab, cold sweats, watch them shake
I'm not that genie in a bottle, I'm in a bag
Take one hit and slide off to the Land of H man
When we first met, I thought you never doubt me
Now you tryin' to leave me, you never live without me
Girl I'm missing you, come and see me soon
Tie your arm up; put that lighter under that spoon
Now put that needle to ya arm princess
Stick it in, relapse
I'm back bitch, don't ever try that again
All the shit I did for you, I made you feel good
We have a love thing, you treatin' this like it's just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart you dirty bitch
I won't forget what you did
If you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids
Listen I don't give a damn if your ass starts smokin'
But we have a bond that is not to be broken

[Chorus: repeat 2X] 
We got a love thing
Girl you tried to leave me but you need me
Can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing
I can take ya higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be

[50 Cent]
Baby you know, on the low, ya sister been eyein' me
I'm good lookin', so you know so she be tryin' me
Heard she bi-sexual, she fuck what that girl
But boy oh boy, fuckin' wit me is a whole 'nother world
After that first night she fall in love, then chase the feelin
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote Sexual Healing
Kurt Cobain, we were good friends, Ozzy Osbourne too
I be with rock stars, see you lucky I'm fuckin' with you
I chilled with Frankie Lymon and Jimi Hendrix crew
See this is new to you, but to me this aint new
I live the lavish life
Listen if the mood is right
Me you and ya sister can do the do tonight
I never steer you wrong, if you hyper I make you calm
I'll be your incentive and your reason to make you move on
Let's make a date, promise you'll come to see me
Even if it means you have to sell ya mama's TV
I love you, love me back
No one said lovin' me be easy

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I love you
I gotchu' bad footed on glass
Chasin a dove
That monkey on ya back symbolizes my love
Your friends talk bad about me, bitch
You sit there and listen to them
Over and over you hurt me
My love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up
When you down, then they got nothin' to say
But when you call up, I come runnin' 
I always take the pain away
They set you up to let you down
You crowned, you prom queen
They know bout me behind your back
Call you a fuckin' fiend
We just need to be alone so I can kiss and hug you
Push me inside you 
No other man can love you like I do
Call me daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean real good
I find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should
It was written long before us, it was carved in a tree
Forever me and you baby, we were meant to be
There's more to life than laughter, what brought us together was fate
But we'll be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates
I'ma see to that, I'ma do whatever it takes

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Yeah, yeah we can ride to this
Just lay back, and cruise

Here's a taste of my life, it's bitter and sweet
I pour my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street
Put my Teflon on, and roll with my heat
I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggaz
In the race for the cheese I run laps around niggaz
Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds
Sooner as my sneaker wear in stores, Reebok stock soared
I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggaz could tell
A East coast crib the size of a small hotel
The shit journalists, write about me leave me confused
Have me feelin like the heavyweight champ when he lose
I read somewhere, I'm homophobic - sheeit
Go through the hood, there's mad niggaz on my dick
Now we can get hostile, or we can this smooth
TNT around, I can still make blow move

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are ridin to it - c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music - let's go, let's go

[50 Cent]
Last year I woke up with good luck, damn it feels good
On the low, I done fucked like half of Hollywood
Had yo' favorite actress, from yo' favorite shows
In my favorite position, you know how it goes
And my Bentley bumpin Prince shit, this is "When Doves Cry"
This is what it sounds like when hollow-tip slugs fly
Homey this is somethin you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, cause niggaz will ride and smoke you
Jealousy's for women but some niggaz is bitch made
They make you wanna run across they head with a switchblade
They point the finger at me, sayin I'm bugged
My flow's crack, you listen?  Your fuckin brain's on drugs
Look ice drippin on my neck, hands grippin on a tec
Fool trippin threw a set, you can get yo' ass wet
Cards messin up my deck, screws loose show respect
You try to come at me kid yo' ass better come correct

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
My momma gave birth to a winner, I gotta win
Pray the Lord forgive me for my sins (uh-huh) I'm still thuggin
Cruisin, rims gleamin like the stones on my wrist
Zonin, guess this is how it feels to be rich
Homey, you all front backwards if you chasin a bitch
Stupid - chase the paper they come with the shit
I'm fallin, in love with success
Entrepeneur, conniseur, I maneuver the best
Rollin, Ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle
Stunner have your homies burnin rest in peace candles
As wise men speak I listen and learn
A man dies, a baby's born, my nigga the world turns
Rappers I make 'em sick, when I say I'm the shit
They mistake my confidence for arrogance, they hate on the kid
In 99 I had a vision and made a decision
Bein broke is against my religion, now I'm caked up - what?

[Chorus] - to fade

[Chorus - repeat 2x]
Lil mama, show me how you move it
Better yet, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it
Shake - sh-sh-shake that ass girl!

[Verse]
Go, go, go, 50 in the house
Bounce, y'all already know what I'm about
The flow sound sick over Dre drums nigga
I ain't stupid, I see Doc then my doe come quicker, whoa!
Shorty hips is hypnotic, she moves it so erotic
Girl watch, I'm like bounce that ass girl
I get it crunk in here, I make it jump in here
Front in here we'll thump in here ohh!!
So gutter, so ghetto, so hood
So gully, so grimey, what's good
Outside the Benz on dubs, I'm in the club wit the snub
Don't start nothing, there won't be nothing, uhh!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let's party! Everybody stand up
Everybody put your hands up
Let's party! Everybody bounce wit me
Some champagne and burn a little greenery

[Verse]
It's hot! Disco inferno!
Let's go! You're now rocking wit a pro
I get dough to flip dough, to get more fa sho'
Get my drink on, then get on the dance floor
Look homie I don't dance, all I do it this
It's the same two step wit a lil twist
Listen punk I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Pay attention boy I'll teach you how to do this shit
You mix a little Goose wit a little Dom Perignon
And a little Hennessy, you know we fin' to carry on
I'm hollering at these shorties in the club trying to get right
We gon be up in this bitch till we break daylight

[Chorus]

[Verse]
You see me shining, lit up wit diamonds
Cause I stay grindin, uh huh!
Homie you can catch me swooping
Bentley Coupe and switching lanes, haha!
If you see me rolling, you know I'm holding
I'm bout my paper, yeah!
Nigga I'm serious, I ain't playing
I'll embed it in your brain, I'm off the chain, G Unit!!
Next level now, turn it up a notch
Em and Dre sent me to tear up the spot
Front on me, oh no, you know I'm loco
Hands up on the dance floor, okay let's go

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Yeah, Sha-dy, Aftermath - G-Unit!

[Intro]
Damn baby all I need is a lil' bit
A lil' bit of this, a lil' bit of that
Get it crackin in the club when you hear the shit
Drop it like it's hot, get to whippin that back
Girl shake that thing, yeah work that thing
Let me see it go up, and, down
Rotate that thang, I wanna touch that thang
When you make it go round and round

[50 Cent]
I step up in the club I'm like "Who you wit?"
G-Unit in the house, yeah that's my click
Yeah I'm young but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up boy, I done warned you
Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch
I ain't tryin to beef, I'm tryin to get my drink on
And my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'ma kick it at the bar 'til it's time to go
Then I'ma get in shorty ear and I'ma let her know

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin and touchin a lil' bit
Get to lickin and {fuckin} a lil' bit

[50 Cent]
This is 50, comin out your ster-e-o
It's hard to tell though cause I switched the flow
Eyes a little low cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get, your bitch, she on me dawg
She must, ta heard, about the dough
Now Captain c'mon and Save-a-Hoe
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
#1 on the chart all the time mayne
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man
She backed it up on me I'm like ohh man
I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin, party jumpin, I said loud and clear

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Baby you got me feelin right, you heard me?
My momma gone you can spend the night, you heard me?
I ain't playin I'm tryin to {fuck} tonight, you heard me?
Clothes off, face down, ass up, c'mon, ha ha

[Chorus] - 2X

[Chorus - 2X]
Y'all niggaz know (wut wut y'all niggaz know what I'm about)
Y'all niggaz know, find me at my do' when the guns come out

[Verse 1]
I do this all the time, stuck with a little shine
Walk with a little nine, case I get in a bind
They say I'm fuckin' crazy, they think I'm out my mind
Cause I'm down to bust a nigga head all the time
Now you know the hoes, they know how I roll
In that new Rolls with the suicide doors
22 inch chrome, a nigga money low
You try to touch me, I put out ya get ya brains blown
You go against the grain, pussy and you on ya own
You right there in my zone, welcome to the terridome
The ice blowin' my chain, blood blow in my veins
Blue still in the range, I'm doin' my thang
The semi auto spray, run if you get away
I'll find your whereabouts and clap at you another day
nigga play with the bread, get a hole in ya head
You touch a dime of mine thug and your ass dead

[Chorus - 2X]
Y'all niggaz know (wut wut y'all niggaz know what I'm about)
Y'all niggaz know, find me at my do' when the guns come out

[Verse 2]
In the hood, hoopty, hate low, niggaz don't know I'm around
Hop out, hit 'em up, lay my murder game down
You see me in ya projects, 187's in progress
Hard niggaz finna' soften up when that lead touch 'em
You cut 'em once and keep fight, fuck it just keep cuttin' em
Its real killa instinct, kill or be killed
Trust me, you don't wanna feel how hollow tips feel
Fuck around and get ya cap peeled
nigga you know the drill, Brownsville
Flat bush, ground heights, Brooklyn Zoo
Feed the wolves, they eat the food
And they ?? fathom too
nigga welcome to the jungle, New York New York
Gangstas who sign language actually let their guns talk
Look homie, I'm cool with some bloods, I'm cool with some crips
I'm cool but if there's a problem, nigga I got extra clips
I don't know karate, but I split the bricks
I don't love 'em loverboy, we the shit bitch

[Chorus - 2X]
Y'all niggaz know (wut wut y'all niggaz know what I'm about)
Y'all niggaz know, find me at my do' when the guns come out

[Verse 3]
I'll come through and touch ya, walk out then cut ya
In case your dumbass wanna tussle
AR-15, cooling system makes the shell case muffled
Scope, infra-red, run you're still dead
Hit your calf, hit your ass, hit ya back, then your head
Contract killa, murder for the scrilla
Search, find a nigga, run up behind a nigga
Shoot car windows out to flatline a nigga
Gun pop, heart stop, homie this is heavy
You on your way to meet your maker, nigga are you ready
No exception to the rule, death is promised
Plus I just bought my niggaz new macs and llamas
Got respect for you, ?? I will commodate you
One phone call and niggaz will exterminate you
No future fuckin' with me, there's no tomorrow
niggaz'll run up on you tonight and hit ya the hardest

[Chorus - 2X]
Y'all niggaz know (wut wut y'all niggaz know what I'm about)
Y'all niggaz know, find me at my do' when the guns come out

[50 Cent]
You ready? Okay let me wind you up
Do it exactly the way I said do it man
These niggaz is pussy you heard me?
Get up nice and close

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I put that battery in his back, I'm the reason why he move like that
That's my muh'fuckin toy soldier
I tell him pop that gat, he gon' pop that gat
You don't wanna play with my toy soldier
I say it's on then it's on until your life is over
Fuckin with my toy soldier
If youse a casualty of war, trust me I got more
You don't want it with my toy soldiers

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
Listen up close now, follow instructions
Catch a nigga slippin, run up on him and buck him
I ain't got no conscience no morals or nothin
They ain't wit us, they against us, we supposed to touch 'em
Here's what to do if you see him approach me
Pop that nigga, I don't care if he know me
Half the niggaz hatin on me used to be homies
I don't trust 'em when they smile or when they frown cause they phony
Everytime I come around they call the police on me
That's why the D's in the precinct know me
They know about my rap sheet, they know 'bout how I clap heat
Run like I'm in a track meet, swift with the mac, B
You can see the envy in they eyes fo' sho' mayn
Mad as a motherfucker that I'm holdin
See me in the back of the Phantom, rollin
Quick to make examples out of niggaz fo' sho' man, hold me down

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Shoot, stab, kill muh'fucker
If you ain't 'bout it I don't want you around, cocksucker
Every word out my mouth is felt; that oo-wop pop
Them hollows so hot, yo' ass'll melt
Barber razor in the club, stunt - I'll give you a shape up
Have your ass stitched, gored, your head all taped up
Niggaz know how I get down, see they know when I'm around
Ha ha, my soldiers around
And if some shit goes down - and a nigga get laid down
It's no surprise cause niggaz know how we get down
Black tints on the Testarossa, hammer out the holster
Gat in my lap in case you gotta get clapped
You monkey niggaz swing through my hood, we on that Gorilla shit
You clap off and miss, we come back, start killin shit
Catch us on the corner wearin black chinchilla shit
We organized, disciplined, plus we militant

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Two windows to a man's soul
... fill you with holes
Listen homey.. I'm the man for the job
So if he ain't.. (Yayo, c'mon!)

[Verse Three: Tony Yayo]
I'm in that two-door Phantom and the body's kitted
Waves in my head lookin like tsunami hit it
Niggaz scheme, but the infrared beam's on the mack
I'll put green on yo' head like an Oakland A's hat
One boy was a doja, now he a soldier
My little son Dula lettin off the Ruger
In a whip masked up, lookin for his enemies
Ridin gassed up, off double D batteries
His last casualties, is hooked to them IV's
(50 gimme the word) that's when I squeeze (yeah!)
Click-clack, take that, fall back
It's a contract, 50 grand, I'm 50 man

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Yeah!  This is the general speakin (yeah)
When I say move (ha ha ha) nigga you better move
Soldier, ha ha
I don't want nobody talkin to none of my niggaz
Come around here with that bullshit
Tryin to feed niggaz bad information and shit
That's how my toys malfunction

[Intro]
Ha ha ha!  I told niggaz not to shoot dice with me
Look at this stack, I got money, I got money!!
Ha ha ha..

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Ahh nigga don't trip, I'll kill you if you fuck with my grip
I won't hesitate to let off a clip
Ahh nigga don't trip, you gon' make me get on some shit
Run up on you quick, wet up your whip
Ahh nigga don't trip, you gon' get your monkey-ass hit
Runnin your lip, tryin to fuck with my clique
Ahh nigga don't trip, in case you didn't know who this is
It's 50 Cent bitch, G-Unit
Ahh nigga don't trip

[50 Cent]
I come through your hood, stuntin in my yellow Lamb'
Murcielago, top down, nigga damn
I'm the biggest crook from New York since Son of Sam
Cruisin, bumpin Buck's shit, Ruger in my hand
Thinkin the East ain't enough, it's time to expand
I plan to head out West and plant my feet down
A nigga big as King-Kong in the street now
I do a little house shoppin, and buy me a crib
It's palm trees and pretty bitches out in Cali kid
I touch the Hollywood paper, go and shoot me some flicks
Have some supermodel bitches come and suck on some dick
Mama'll turn in her grave if I married a white chick
But baby'll suck the chrome off a Chevy an' shit
Niggaz be wearin fake shines, I'm rockin a lil' charm
30 carats on the pinky, kiss the ring on the Don
Crack open that Cali bud, stuff the weed in the palm

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
And if you hustle, for me I'll hustle harder
I got what you need, them trees that hard that powder
My niggaz move G-packs, every hour on the hour
They shoot when I say shoot, so I'm in a position of power
You fuck around if you wanna

[50 Cent]
Where I'm from you learn to blend in or get touched
I don't need niggaz for support, I don't walk with a crutch
Niggaz know my steez, they don't fuck with me son
You got a appetite for hollow-tips, I feed you my gun
This is Ferrari F-50 shit, it's real laid back
Type shit you recline to in the Maybachs
I got two shooters now on the run from the fuzz
You get the same shit for 10 bodies you get from one cuz
I live life in the fast lane; hundred miles an hour
Chrome and some woodgrain
You know a nigga still really tryin to move 'caine
Make a little extra money on the side mayne, I ain't playin
I'm up early with the bird's word, puttin that work in
Pirellis on the Porsche chirpin, I'm makin moves
I got a hundred mill' from music, a hundred grand from crack
I'm goin to see my jeweler so I can blow a stack

[Chorus]

[Jamie Foxx ? singing]
La la lahh, la la la la la la la lahh

[50 Cent ? talking]
Yeah, uh huh, I like how the way that feel

[Chorus ? 50 Cent]
I'll build you, but if ever I fall down
And I need you to pick me up
Promise me, you'll be around
Hold me down, I'll build you up

[50 Cent ? Verse 1]
Listen, if you let me, I'll be the reason you shine
It's the secret, I want the world to know that your mine
But on some real shit, communications could be better
So I'm writing this song instead of a love letter
They gon' play it on the radio a hundred times a day
I figure when you hear it you gon' stop and think of me
I wanna get to know you, and be the reason you smile
Girl you know where I'm from, you know how I get down
When times get tough, tell me that I'm special
Not rap, I mean me, that I'm special
You know they say diamonds are a girl's best friend
Precious stones, could you put me before them?
If so, I'll see to it they always around
Nothing but the best, now how does that sound?
If I drop a jewel when we talk you can keep it
Girl you on my mind all the time, that's a secret (shhhc)

[Jamie Foxx ? Chorus]
Baby I build you up
Girl, if I, never show, I'd have you by my side
Oooohhhooohhh yeah
I'd build you up
Girl I, need to know for sure you're mine
I need to know for sure, right now
Girl, if I, never show, I'd have you by my side
I'd build you up
Girl I, need to know for sure you're mine

[50 Cent ? Verse 2]
I thinkin' 'bout you thinkin' that you feel the same way
Or is it just my imagination that get runnin' away?
If you ready to ride, girl, c'mon, let's roll
G-5-5 fly, ma, let's go
It's hard to measure the pleasure of havin' you in my presence
You're smile makes me smile, I'll show you my style
You can shop a little bit, I'll pick out some shit
One pair at a time 'til your shoe game sick
Now who knows what the future holds we'll be together probably
For, better or worse, like Whitney & Bobby
If you wanna play house, we can play house then
But wait, why pretend when you can move in?
Before I be your buddy in bed let me be your best friend
Girl, it's more than lust, I want your trust
You keep it real with me, I keep it real with you
'Cuz I know wit' you by my side there's nothing I can't do, yeah

[Jamie Foxx ? Chorus]
Baby, girl, if I, never show, I'd have you by my side
I'd build you up
Oooohhhooohhh
Girl I, need to know for sure your mine
Build you up, baby, when you're down,
Cuz your smile, like a frown, yes I will
I'm gon build you up baby
La la lahh, la la la la la la la lahh [repeat 8x]

[Intro/Chorus: 50 Cent]
God gave me stylllle, God gave me grace
- God give me style, God give me grace
God put a smilllle, on my face
- Ha ha, God put this smile on my face
God make me shiiiine, like the sun
- God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feeeeel, like I'm the one
- Sometimes I feel like I'm the one

[Break]
It ain't my fault, I just reach for style
I'm hot, I breaks it down
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down
The way I break it down

[50 Cent]
Listen you can call me what you want, black and ugly
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my CD's drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a track star runnin through life chasin my dreams
Best deal I made was tradin the mic for that triple beam
I zone off thinkin is there really heaven or hell
If so what happens to a changed man that dies in a cell?
I need no answers to these questions, cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me, but my music
It's a gift given from God, so I'ma use it - yeah

[Chorus] + [Break]

[50 Cent]
Some days I'm in the crowd, all by myself
Bunch of niggaz around, I'm still by myself
I drift off on a cloud, by myself
Thinkin 'bout nothin more, than life - what else?
These days it's hard to tell who really cares for me
So when you hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A O.G. told me God's favorites have a hard time
You're out the hood, that's good, now stay on the grind
I'm a sponge, knowledge and wisdom I ab-sorb fast
I'm in a class by myself, you do the math

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
It ain't my fault, yeah
Shoutout to Reverand Floyd Flake
It ain't my fault, Creflo Dollar, TD Jakes
Bishop Eddie L. Long. Easy-L shorty. Ha ha
Wooo! Feels good
Oh yeah, can't forget Bishop Morton
Cause my mama key on me, ha ha

[Chorus: Olivia]
Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
I'll be around to catch your call
Cuz you're my baby (you're my baby)
And I adore you
You always brighten up my day
I'll never ever let you wait
Cuz you're my baby (you're my baby)
And you're amazing (so amazing)

[50 Cent]
I'm from, city to city, to show to show
See me I been grinding across the globe
I hustle hard to get the grip fa'sho
So when I make time to call you, you should pick up the phone
Tell me, what's on your mind when you alone
I have you touching on yaself, girl all in the zone
Now if I turned you on
With things I say, would I be wrong?
Then I don't wanna be right
Matter of fact, I'd be on the next flight
Trying to get it on with you tonight
Do the things you like
Touch the right spot, have ya piping hot
While the wind blow through ya hair in the drop
Just lay back, relax to the sounds of the sex
And let me do what I do until you climax
You can go straight to sleep after it's all over
In the morning, roll over and we can start over

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Yeah, I called just to say
"Hope you're having a nice day"
You're special, I'd get into you
Oops, I mean I'm into you
Every chance I get, I find time to spend with you
Jet to bring you to me, just to watch a movie
Better yet, to watch you climb into the jacuzzi
Yeah, Bubbles in the bath, Don in the glass
Funny how time flies when you full of laughs
It's fun, but before long, a nigga gotta dash
For the lifestyle I live, a nigga need cash
To come quick, so I don't fuck with the stash
I know you like pumps and boots, I like Jeeps and Coupes
So I grind all the time to save me some loot
I put a spell on ya, I like to call it a spell
In the bedroom working it well, I don't kiss and tell
But I don't care if you kiss and tell
You can tell ya girlfriend the details

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[50 Cent]
Yeah, it is what it is man
Uh-huh

Sirens flashin you know the routine, the crime scene taped off
It started out a robbery, they blew half his face off
They seen him shinin, cross full of diamonds he bought grindin
His first slip off the ladder of success he was climbin
The D's came through, askin niggaz if they know what happened
Somehow my name end up in anything that involves clappin
Detectives at my mama crib, they say they wanna question me
They put me in a lineup last time and they arrested me
When it come to cookin coke, they know I got the recipe
I turn a quarter to a half, that's why they mess with me
I'm the neighborhood pusher, I move packs to make stacks
A little weed, a little X, a little H, little crack
Figure, I'll push it to the limit, take the shit to the max
Navy blue vest on, navy blue Yankee hat
Calm, in my palm's fully loaded firearm
First to let off last to run, everytime it's on

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I tell niggaz to suck my dick, get the fuck out my face
Cause I don't need 'em
Cause they're, never around, when I'm down
Shot and I'm bleedin

(What?  Nigga is there.. is there a motherfuckin problem nigga?)
(Oh, yeah that's what I, I thought so.. pussy!)

[50 Cent]
Niggaz be talkin 'bout me, they always callin me crazy
Fuck them O.G. niggaz, they stuck in the 80's
Sayin they gon' do me somethin, now you know that's a lie
Nigga you look at me wrong I let the hammer fly
I'm rich, I still wake up, with crime on my mind
Queens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime
When I say move, nigga move, or get caught in the crossfire
I prevents runnin, cut my fuckin hand on the barbed wire
This shit's crazy, it's just a different day it's the same shit
Hollow-tip partin yo' head, leave your whole fuckin brain split
They sick, they see me in that Aston Martin
What's the matter?  They can't get that hooptie started
Thought they was grindin, well God damn, where that money at?
Thought you was puffed up, cause you was lettin paper stack
You ain't a hustler, matter fact, youse a buster
I don't trust ya, I should send niggaz to touch ya

[Chorus]

(What?  Who say they gon' do somethin to me?)
(Must be out your rabbit-ass mind, fuck around kill one of these niggaz)

[50 Cent]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh..

Comin up I was confused, my mommy kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check check out +My Melody+"
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggaz had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent] + (The Game)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP)
(And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[The Game]
I told Dre from the gate "I'd carry the heat for ya"
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya
Put Compton on my back when you in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my N.W.A. gold
I had the whole crowd yellin "Free Yayo!"
So niggaz better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C.
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your lil' rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West coast mouth-to-mouth?

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent] + (Lloyd Banks)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP)
(And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[50 Cent]
From the beginnin to the end, losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change, it's stayin' the same

[Lloyd Banks]
How many of them boys is witcha'
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walking with a snub, cause niggaz do a lot of slick talkin
in the club 'til they coughin on the rug
Ain't never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke, my boy just got poked in the throat
Now it's an Auggie shirt and my coat
Now I'm speedin, reminiscin; holdin my weed in, never listen
If I see him I'ma lift 'em
And maybe that'll even the score
But if not, it'll be me on the floor

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent] + (Tony Yayo)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP)
(And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[Tony Yayo]
I started out at 15, scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and made them sales
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil deuce-deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin +Easy Jesus+, rockin a leases
My momma wit me when she found my pieces
I look back on life, thank God I'm blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest

[Young Buck]
You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, it's a hood thang; that's why I'm loved in Brook-lyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey, I'm still all good
Let me show you what a thug bout I'm born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put 'em in my fo'-five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent] + (Young Buck)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP)
(And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[Chorus]
Nigga, my gun go off!! 
You see tha barrell turnin'
You feel tha hollows burnin'
Nigga, now you learnin'

Nigga, my gun go off!! 
Call it attempted murder
Nigga I'm trynna merk ya
When I come back, bussin'

Nigga, my gun go off!! 
Don't trynna say I'm trippin'
When I get to flippin'
Then I smack tha clip in

Nigga, my gun go off!! 
We call it puttin' work in
Leavin' niggas hurtin'
Homocide's lurkin'

Nigga, my gun go off!!

[Verse 1]
Fuck boy you can see it to belie' it
Trynna dodge and wave it, end up a parapelegic
Belie' me, it's easy
I'll hurt you, I'll merk you, I'll pop some'in
Drop some'in, I ain't gone stop huntin'
Run-run till you're spun
One shot, one gun
One-9... 1-1, emergency
It's murder B
It's excellent execution when I'm pullin' tha trigga
No mistake, for that cake
I'm hittin' you and ya niggas
Feel tha flame when I aim
For tha top of ya brain
See tha spark and tha bang
Nigga shit ain't a game
Do tha math or get blast
Bullets go thru tha glass
Go-thru-ya-ass, fast
And tha leather seat sittin' Ave
Nigga
It's not a war when there's casualties on one side
I ride!
Turn it up on you niggas after Jay ride-by
I click-clack, that's that! I don't flash, I mash
I wave tha Uzi at 'em
I make a movie out 'em

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yeahh.
You better lose yourself in tha moment
Use it, fuck-tha-music, I'ma let it go!
You only get one shot before I back out and fire back
At ya hat, cha back, ya ass crack, ya nutsack
Ya caddilac, if you make it to that--I'm hittin' that!
The 70's was smack, 80's crack! 90's was grimey
Millenium macs, man
Clips on tha whips, I ride in 'em
Bad bitches I ride-inn 'em
Don't worry, I'll gett'em
Gat Jammed or un-jammed
Goddamn safest the safety don't work
Squeeze tha Eagle, it chirp
End up faced down in the durt--more than hurt
Bring tha beef where you hang out
Bang out
Shots rang out!
Hit ya shoulders, trynna blow ya brains out!
Hit ya hommies in they legs
Bet they have their canes out, tomorrow
You know tomorrow's just a day away
If you can keep ya heart beatin' then ya ass awake!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
AOWWWW~! It hurts...
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah - YEAH!!

D's tryin to plant a murder on me
In the precinct they sayin I done murdered homey
I told my lawyer I ain't heard of homey
And e'rybody know my niggaz buried him fo' me
You see I'm on your crib it ain't a burglary homey
They fin' to have me stuck in purgatory
I'm down to do the stickin when it come to the orgy
Conventional methods of sex, totally bore me
Wait~! I'm gettin sidetracked, back to the story
These cocksuckin {*censored*} got it in fo' me
{*censored*} they wanna {*censored*} me up
{*censored*} me find my burner and {*censored*} me up
But history repeats itself, they never learn
The Unit's the new people who gon' {*censored*}
Huh, we'll find out when niggaz let off the rounds
And this {*censored*} screamin {*censored*} down

[Chorus]
Get in the way, I'll murder dem

A nigga already got three strikes, I'll murder dem
I said I'll murder dem
Any motherfucker touch me, I'll murder dem
I'll murder dem
You don't believe me wait and see, I'll murder dem
You see I told you I'd murder dem

[50 Cent]
They sayin I'm an accident waitin to happen
I got one in the head, I'm just waitin to clap it
A pimp told me I was made for this mack shit
So just get you a white girl, don't fuck with no black bitch
I got two felonies, from sellin that crack shit
And the third one, came from showin niggaz my mac spit
See I'm down for that daytime action
Have niggaz crawlin under cars when I start to cappin
So they don't know what to say to the {*censored*}
But they know if word get back, somethin gon' happen
I've been shot, I've been stabbed, but I ain't been snitched on
When you snitchin where I'm from you gon' get your shit blown
Southside - I make the best of the worst
We gotta share the same bitch, okay I go first
Cause your, baby's momma is my, baby's momma
I come through to see my little nigga with the llama

[Chorus]

[Chorus: Akon]
Ohhhh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nuttin change still holla at my homies
Ohh and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggaz get to fuckin around
If niggaz get to fuckin around

[50 Cent]
Yeah... respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me if you could catch one in your wig
You see the Testarosa, the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line and nigga get clapped
I got a arsenal, an infantry I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now nigga I'll be the end of you
Forget your enemies and think of what your friends'll do
I drop a bag off, they'll let a mag off
The Heckler and Koch'll tear half of your ass off
I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playing
The hollow tips rain, when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lines or get the message from the 9
Paint a picture with words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine
I let 21 shots off at the same time, YEAH!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Yeah... where I'm from death is always in the air homie
Nana love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creepin through the hood wearin teflon
Hit the corners motherfuckers get left on
Niggaz know, if not they better check my background
Try and stick me I'll fill your back with mac rounds
Ask Prim' nigga 50 don't "Back Down"
I kick it funky like fiends in the crack house
Cross the line boy I'ma air ya ass out
Screw your face at me I wanna know what that's 'bout
Nigga I know you ain't mad I done came up
And if you are, fuck you cause I ain't change up
The O.G.'s wanna talk but I don't know these niggaz
And I ain't did no business wit 'em, I don't owe these niggaz
a minute of my time, I get it cause I grind
All across the globe like the world's mine, YEAH!

[Chorus]

[Akon]
{*cell door slams*} Konvict
Now tell me have you ever looked off in the distance
and seen the mac aimin at your head mayne (head mayne)
Before you know it life is flashin reminiscin
and your body is drippin and full of lead mayn (lead mayne)
I done been there (uh-huh) I done copped that (uh-huh)
It ain't never been a question I'm bout that (uh-huh)
Don't go there (uh-huh) you get clapped at (uh-huh)
And if you plan to fuck around and re-route that (uh-huh)
You'll never catch me ridin around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons unloaded will unleash
Stash up under the carpet like a can of sea breeze
50 don't make me ride on these niggaz (ay)
Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggaz (ohhhh)
50 don't make me ride on these niggaz (ay)
Cause I be long gone like the ripper, so

[Verse 1]
I took quarter water sold it in bottles for 2 bucks
And Coca-Cola came and bought it; for billions, what the fuck?
Have a baby by me baby, be a millionaire
I write the check before the baby comes, who the fuck cares
I'm stanky rich, I'ma die tryna spend this shit
Southsides' up in in this bitch
Yeah I smell like the vault, I used to sell dope
I did play the block-now I play on boats
In the south of France baby, St. Tropez
Get a tan, I'm already black, rich, I'm already that
Gangsta, get a gat, hit a head in a hat
Call that a river rat, shit, fuck the chitter chat
The baker, I bake the bread-the barber, I cut your head
The marksman, I spray the led-"Blood clot, chop your leg!"
Do not fuck with the kid
I get biz with the cigg, I come where you live, ya dig?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You can call this my new shit, but it ain't new though
I got rid of my old bitch, now I got new hoes
First it was the Benzo, now I'm in the Enzo
Ferrari, I'm sorry! I keep blowin up! (Oh!!)
They call me the cake man, the strawberry shake man
I spray the AR, make your whole click break dance
Back spin, head spin, flatline, your dead then
9 shells, Mac-10, "Who wan' get it crackin?!"
I was young, I couldn't do good, now I can't do bad
I ride, wreck the new Jag, I just buy the new Jag
Now nigga why you mad? Oh you can't do that?
I'm so forgetful, they callin me cocky
I come up out the jeweler, they callin me Rocky
It's the ice on my neck man, the wrist and my left hand
Bling like bloaw, you like my style
Ha Ha-I'm heading to the bank right now!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, I talk the talk, and I walk the walk
Like a teflon Don, but I run New York
When I come outta court, yea I pop the cork
I keep it gangsta, I have ya outlined in chalk(I-I Get It)
In the hood if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya I'm about my bread(I-I Get It)
Round the world if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya they love the kid (I-I Get It)

Bring 'em in, kick 'em out, bring 'em in, kick 'em out
Bring 'em in, you ain't freakin we ain't speakin bitch

[50 Cent]
They said we couldn't do it, look now, I did it
I topped "In Da Club," I'm still sippin the bubb'
The drama I'm widdit, I get biz, you get it
I breezed on that shiddit, I split your widdig
That's why a nigga bit it, I can't forget it
I said I didn't do it, witnesses said I did it
I'm fresh out on bail, my Benz is all kitted
Five TV's, my rims is so siddick
I cruise through your bitch and just fall in love with it
Baby come in - girl I wanna give it to you
Once I'm in - in sum, I'm a freak with it
Money come quiddick, hot shit I spit it
G-Unit kitted, blue New York fitted
Shorty wanna cut, oh yeah, I'm with it
She come to my hotel room, she know she gon' get it
It's exercise, my homey he been waitin
He next to ride

[Chorus]

[50 Cent - singing]
People always talkin 'bout
My reputation~! I don't love 'em, I don't need 'em
I don't love 'em, I don't need 'em, I don't love 'em
I don't care, what she do, with him
It's all good with me
Soo-oooh-ooooooooh

[50 Cent]
Yeah
They can't do it how I do it, I'm #1, I knew it
I thug, do my thang, and gangsters bop to it
It's hit after hit, damn I'm on the road
I'm like James Brown now, man I got soul
Naw I ain't a pimp but HELL YEAH I got hoes
I was born due to this, when I breathe I make a killin
You think I'm bullshittin, my money touchin the ceiling
Can't buy condos, I'm buyin the building
I'm pissin the wrong women, R. Kelly do it to children
You bet against me boy, I'ma hurt your feelings
Cause over and over I'ma keep on winnin
My Rolls Royce tinted, your Phantom rented
That's why we never ever ever see you in the hood with it
Man e'rybody know, like e'rywhere I go
When 50 in the club shit just go out of control
You can blame it on Em, or blame it on Dre; okay~!

In the fantasy, it's plain to see, just how it be, her and me
Backstrokin, sweat soakin, all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch till the club close
Watchin her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down

Different style, different mood, damn I like the way you move

From the couch to the counters in my kitchen

[Intro: Robin Thicke] + (50 Cent)
Girl when I go, where we go, I wanna take you 'round the globe with me
I got dough (ha ha) plenty baby you can blow with me
And baby I know (uh-huh) that money ain't ev-ery-thing
But it's fo' sho' (fo' sho, fo' sho') and ain't for nothin when you fuck, with, me
Now when I go

[Chorus: 50 Cent] + (Robin Thicke)
(Follow my lead)
Baby I can be all you need, if you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me
Baby follow my lead (follow my lead)
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me
Follow my lead - follow my lead
I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead

[50 Cent]
Don't listen to the rumors, they say 50 fuckin crazy
50 don't know how to treat a lady, they wrong
I like you a lot, I don't wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I'll call you a bitch
Then hang up, probably call you right back and shit
And have to say, "Baby I apologize"
Cross my fingers, God forgive me for tellin lies
Like Janet Jackson said, I miss you much
I really wanna feel your touch, and smell your scent
Baby I can pass the day
Watchin you model lingerie
I wanna spend the night tonight shorty if it's okay
You can be my Beyonce, I'll be your Jay
Ha ha~! I got a great sense of humor
First I make you smile then I woo you, you know I wanna do ya
Or do ya?

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
After seven hours, New York to London, you're wonderin
What's gon' be the next stop - I told you
I'm a don, you gon' know I'm a don
After you shop 'til your feet hurtin in Milan
Now take a picture, these are moments you can cherish
They say the scenery was made for lovers out in Paris
Ask your fam about me, they say 50 we love him
Without them there's no me, so I love them
Man they're the reason I exist, the reason I insist
I'm never less than the best, I'm perfection I guess
As my niggaz are stressed, I pass the test
Everytime I drop, I'm burnin hot
So I don't care if she loves me or loves me not
Long as I enjoy the time that we spend
I ain't lookin for commitment, we can fuck and be friends
Matter fact, we can do it right in back of my Benz
I get it done with speed

[Chorus] (with Robin Thicke ad libs)

{*more ad libs to fade*}

50 Cent

In case a mother fucker got to get shot
The old timers tell me, slow down
See they know now, I won't hesitate to make shit hot
D's will shut your block down, after your shot down
We gonna come through and set up shop
You niggas gon' work for me now, you gon' see now
How I change shit, re-arrange shit
See for you dog, this is new shit
I'm from Southside, nigga we do this
They say I'm grimey, it's hard to find me
When the sun lighten up the sky
Niggas wanna line me, try and kill me
Go 'head nigga I dare you to try, fuck that nigga!

[Chorus]
We movin on up, yeah we gettin' that dough, fo' sho'
We movin on up, yo' whip chromed up
Cash is flow fo' sho, the dough, nigga you know what?
We movin on up, yeah we gettin' that dough, fo' sho'

Cash is flow fo' sho, the dough, nigga you know what?

[Verse 2]
Im 'bout my bread now, I'll cut your head now
You know you eatin' niggas you should be dead now
I hold a glock down, I gotta drop now
Nigga I'm eatin' you know I aint gon' stop now
One more trip, one more flip
I move a truckload nigga, not one brick
They make me so sick, fuckin' sick to my stomach
You niggas talk shit, but they know they don't I want it
My clicks so sick, niggas know how we on it
Light up more shit, the car there when we on it
I spit a gem star get'cha carved my name on yo' neck
Have my lil homies run up on yo' ass with the tech
Yeah I stunt in the Vette , got stash in the bank
I get head in the whip, I get ass on the jet
I'm oh so fresh, so  motherfuckin' clean
24" Inch gleam, when I pull up on the scene

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Been smokin' that dip, the PCP got 'em thinkin' they can walk on water
That ecstasy will have a nigga rock hard tryna fuck your daughter
The LSD will have niggas runnin' round tryna kill you for us
Smokin' that piff, sippin' that yak, talkin' that shit, loadin' that strap

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Yeah!!! When I'm out in N.Y. boy it's blunts and phillies
When I'm out in L.A. boy it's wraps and swishes
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit

[Verse 1]:
I'm in my Labo maggot, my fo' fo' faggot
Doors lift up I'm like Go Go Gadget
See the shit I got on, homey I hate too
My teflon arm brought my government issues
I'll hit your vertebrae bullets rip through tissues
Your wife on the futon huggin that skitzo
Homey you a bitch you got feminine ways
Heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days
I got fo' fifths and bananas on the case
And got more whips than a runaway slave
Me and Yayo go back like some high top fades
When I made fifty mill, Em got paid
When I made sixty mill, Dre got paid
When I made eighty mill, Jimmy got paid
I ain't even gotta rap now life is made
Said I ain't even gotta rap, I'm filthy mayne

[Chorus]:
I'm laughin straight to the bank with this (Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha) 
I'm laughin straight to the bank with this (Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

I'm laughin straight to the bank with this (Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha) 
I'm laughin

[Verse 2]:
I see nothin but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll
I got the kind of money that the bank can't hold
Got it off the street movin bundles and loads
Seventy Three Caprice old school when I roll
Breeze pass with the EZ Pass fuck the toll
No more platinum I'm wearin gold
I'm internationally known as the kid with the flow
That brings enough dough it's never enough dough
Shit I need mo' I need shit out the sto'
Baby ble was cold fresh out the flo'
Stashbox by the dashbox incase they want war
Make the purple bring the green in fuck the law
I'm oh so raw, I'm hot I'm sure
I'm like the coolest motherfucker around the globe boy
I set the club on fire I told ya
I'm the general salute me soldier

[Chorus]:
I'm laughin straight to the bank with this (Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

I appear and disappear wit' the heata like Houdini
Dat parry and bullshit'll git cha azz popped
Don't believe me - ask Fab, they got his head shot
I'm in the cut like germs, I do durrt like worms
Smoke weed, now I'm sure, nigga it's my turn
I fire on ya azz, dem hollow-tips burn, baby burn
I'm screamin' "Fuck the cops!", ride 'round wit' my glock
There's my pistol on my bitch, nigga fuck dat box!
Dat's how P. got knocked, dat's a jewel I drop
But you ain't peep dat nigga, go 'head, repeat dat nigga
You might learn a lil' summin' if you learn to stop frontin'
I make it look easy on three piece bb's, rollin' locc-in'
Up early wit' the dopemane
 
[Chorus]
When Janet and Jermaine was *Mm mm*, kissin'
I was baggin' one-thousand grams in my kitchen
When Puffy just tellin' Kim, "I love you boo"
I was shinin' my nine, ya know how I do
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
 
[Verse 2]
At the dice game I bet it all, you hear wha I'm sayin'?
Take grand, I form betta nigga I ain't playin'
I'm trynna git it, holla at me if ya wit' it
And lace up the chuckas, we can rob these mothafuckas
My stomach is growlin', they say dat I'm wyllin'
I'm doin' my numbas, I'm gittin' violent
They hearin' me rap and they think dat I'm playin'
Till they see the barrel and they see the flame
I need full co-operation man, give us the chain
The watch, the ring and the grill - we ain't playin'
I fire dat thang, it sound insane
Holla, I got dat nose candi mayne
   
[Chorus]
When Jeezy and Keisha was *Mm mm*, kissin'
I was baggin' one-thousand grams in my kitchen
When Trina was tellin' Wayne, "I love you boo"
She was just runnin' games, she told Buck dat too
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
 
[Outro w/ ad-libin "I got-I got fully loaded clip"]
Now nigga, lemme show ya how I do this right here!

One in the head, 'till it fell!
I put anutha one in it the clip, I put it back!
Dat was big wit' all dat, let the bullets breathe!

Enough to make a nigga lose control
I'm down to go wherever you wan' go
You got a man, I keep it on the low
I do my thing you know I gets my dough

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
On your mark, get set girl now here we go

When you're breakin it down, keep breakin it down
 
[50 Cent]
They say I'm not the same it's cause I'm filthy mayne

I'm hustlin hard homie I do my thang
You fuck with the paper then watch the hammer go bang
Now shorty I like the way she move them hips
I'm tryin to get her in my bedroom and shit
We could take a long time or get it done quick
We can camcord this shit make a boom-boom flick

Girl your body's callin me, hear you loud and clear
We ain't got to leave now we can do it right here
 
[Chorus]
 
[50 Cent]
The way you move (the way you move)
You make me lose (you make me lose)
All control (all control)

You're so seductive you make me wanna touch it
I ain't got to tell you, you know I wanna fuck you
I'm feelin your style, you better watch me now
My tongue'll be in your mouth, my hands'll be in your blouse
When you get me aroused you put a spell on me
Man if I can't have you I'ma go crazy
I want you bad now and if you want me
Girl come to me now, I said come to me now
 
[Eminem]
Come to me now, you don't come to me now
Apple in your mouth, tackled on the couch
Shackled in the house, I'll be back in about
20 minutes or less, with my Hannibal mask
So when you wiggle around and giggle in that cage
I knew I couldn't wait to get you off that stage
From the moment I met you had to let you know
I just wanted to get you through my bedroom do'
You makin me feel like I'm in middle school still
You squeal like a little girl, you're pitiful, chill
We gon' fuck, I just popped this little blue pill
You can leave but wait, I gotta shit on you still {*phbbt*}

I hope you really gettin into my creep show
Let me shit on your chest and if some pee comes out
Just guzzle it down, just guzzle it down
 
[Chorus]
 
[50 Cent]
It's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault

Can you break it down? It's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
I can break it down, it's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
Can you break it down? It's not my fault c'mon

[50 Cent]
I make it hotter... friction turns to fire
You want and desire... I'm comin to get you girl
That's right, that's right, it's on tonight
You're just my type, you're what I like
I bring that heat, you heard me right
Everywhere I go, go, LET'S GO~!
Somethin new it's another episode
Music bumpin, sweat drippin on the danceflo'
I like it when shorty get to backin it back
When she do it like that, I don't know how to act

[Breakdown: 50 Cent]
Now work it
Shorty grind it on me, that's perfect
I'll pay to play if it's worth it
My phone when you want me you can chirp it - if you work it

[Young Buck]
Let me take these bricks and break 'em down
If you want I can serve 'em by the pound
Shorty know she's got what I wanna flip
Baby girl tell me you can handle it

[Chorus: Nicole]
Well if you want it let's go
I got that FIRE!! So hot I burn it down
Act like you already know
I got that FIRE!! Cause I'm the flyest chick around
You want it, it's fire, I got it, that fire
So I'm might, ignite ya, it's fire, it's fire

[50 Cent]
I burn it down on stage, I make it hot
'Til the fire marshall come shut down the spot
I have the club jam packed everytime I rock
These other niggaz ain't got the style I got
I go back to the basics and break it all the way all the way down
You can hate it but face it B.I.G. and Tupac just ain't around
Everywhere you go, there I go, I'm 50 Cent
Ghetto star by the bar I get you bent
You wanna party, you wanna freak be a freak
You wanna freak we can freak tell me where we should we meet
So you can

[Young Buck]
Take these bricks and break 'em down
If you want I can serve 'em by the pound
Shorty know she's got what I wanna flip
Baby girl tell me you can handle it

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Now are you really ready
I said, are you really ready
I make the temperature rise, now don't be surprised
I have the ice on, stuntin heavy
I got a helluva flow, you should already know
Sold over 30 million records already
It's the third time around, you know how I get down
I'm hands down, pound for pound, the best around

[Breakdown]

[50 Cent]
Yeah, yeah, YEAH
YEAHH~!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Now if I give you all of me
What'chu gon' give me back?
Your body is callin me
Got me feelin like a fiend on crack
Why you gonna make me fall in love?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now if I give you all of me
Tell me what'chu gon' give me back?

[50 Cent]
Let's start with the moon and the stars, whatever you into
The money I acquire mama make it all simple
Flashback oh-three, paparazzi flashin flicks
I moved away, hustle hard, now I got a sick stash
Tell me you miss me, baby come here and kiss me
MWAH~! .. It just happened so quickly
Feels like I hopped off a bus and got in a Bentley
It's gangsta my music, even when it's the smooth shit
You can hate me cause I hurt you but I ain't mean to do it
Em predicted it all, I don't know how he knew it
He said women from Hollywood, they LIAR-LIAR-LIARS
You fuck 'em they get you heated, deny you like Mariah
Fast forward to oh-six, I'm still on fire
The world is still turnin, my records are still earnin
Dough come quicker and quicker, flow gets sicker and sicker
Straight up and down baby, I'm a special kind of nigga

[Chorus]

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Ohhh, give it (give it) BABY (BABY)
Give it (give it) OH BABY~!
Give it (give it) baby (baby)
Give it give it baby baby (oh baby)

[50 Cent]
Life is short baby, be a part of my dreams
I own Ferarri horses, my Lamborghini leans
So mean, I have niggaz hatin on me
God gave me a gift, I'm supposed to be rich
I'm supposed to ride through the hood and make niggaz sick
When my homies put in work, they supposed to get hit
With a piece of chain thick and go and buy 'em some bricks
I ain't make that up, this is how it's 'sposed to be kid
You should feel like a life, but then get back that time
When I smile your smile should be as big as mines
Girl to know me's to love me, I'm one of a kind
Even when you hate me you love me, forever you're mine

[Chorus] + [Hook]

[Mary J. Blige]
What you gonna give me back~!
You're gonna make me fall in love {*2X*}
Ohhhhhhhhhhahhhhhhhh, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH YEAH YEAHH HAH YEAHHHH

[50 Cent]
Ay nigga tell 'em where you from!
Southside, I'm a Southside nigga what
Nigga stunt, you know I tear a nigga up

[Chorus]
They say I'm grimy, I'm greasy
I make a one-eight-seven look easy
Fuck that~! I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about

[50 Cent]
I was a snotty nose, nappy head, dirtball nigga
Sayin I can't wait 'til I get a little bigger
After niggaz jumped me, bumpin my head
Thinkin I wish I had a gun I fill a nigga with lead
Took a kitchen knife to {*censored*} fin' to poke me a nigga
Wishin I had a gun so I could smoke me a nigga
Sold my first five quarter gram pieces in the alley
Where Bizzy had the Bondeville and Kev had the Caddy
Now those were the days, when crime really paid
The nine milli sprayed, I got the fuck out the way
From shootout to shootout, the bricks went fast
Robberies went bad, niggaz got blast
Niggaz kidnapped Drew grandpa kid
Came through and shot Ms. Leak in the head
You wonder why I got a gun? So I can get down for mine
You need that, out on the grind all the time

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[50 Cent]
It was Kangols, Cazelli shades, Pumas and corn braids
Doo-rags on the waist, brass knuckles, switchblades
Ski mask to get paid, new shells to get sprayed
Hoodrats to get laid, money to get made
YEAHHH~! .. Yeah I had a dream
I was rich, woke up broke, gun in my hand
Sayin DAMN! .. Dope cost sixty a gram
I got to find me a nigga, line me a nigga
And say "Give it up kid, before I put one in your wig"
Picture me thirsty, ridin 'round foamin out the mouth
Sayin "I don't get on, I'ma lay a nigga out"
Now diamonds are beautiful and pearls are precious
I hit you and your bitch both over your necklace
I'm wreckless, I spray the semi drunk off Henny
Wipe your blood off the shines, run and sell 'em to Benny
Fuck with me, y'all niggaz know Boo Boo get bizzy

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[50 Cent]
Yeah
I gave Just a buck-fifty, ask him if I cut niggaz
Shootouts in Bedford, ask them if I bucked niggaz
In four-fifth they call me Boo Boo, the accident baby
Hennessy and cocaine helped to grime me and make me
My eyes don't cry, I'm a fatherless child
Got my ass whooped in Spofford but never that now
When my name in your mouth, you better watch how you talk
I'll send yo' punk ass to therapy to learn how to walk
I bust a clip, I'll hit ya hip, I'm takin your shit
Thats how the eses play, for that SSK
Your probably heard through the grapevine, I'm good out in Watts
Bulletproof shit, cruisin through them Compton blocks
I'm the beast from the East, but I play on the West
In the drop by myself with my nine and my vest
And you niggaz best be on yo' best behaviors
I was bred for this shit, front on me I'ma blaze ya

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Chorus]
[5C] Man I run this rap shit

[50 Cent]
You wan' dance, let's dance nigga, I take you to the prom
I'm armed, trey-pound in my palm, I'm calm nigga
My momma made a baby boy, the hood made a man
My first 14 grams, took that and made a grand
I do this, you knew this, I told you pussy
Your fate, your death day to fuckin come if you push me
Have you like E.I. E.I., uh-ohhh after the four-four blow
I get low, they say I go like a pro
It's a wrap, and I'm ghost, in the smoke, like a roach
You've been clapped, and in fact, there's no comin back from that
I'm the last of my breed, no Henny, no weed
Just my vest, and my semi, in the back, of the Bentley
Enage, a mirage, see I'm there, then I'm gone
Cause my lawyers are strong and my money is long
So when I'm right I'm right, and when I'm wrong I'm right
I hit your ass up right, nigga it's nighty-night

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]
Yeah! Yeah! Yo, YO
Aiyyo I'm higher than a pilot man, I catch a body man
Beat the case, I lie on the polygram
These O.G.'s talkin 'bout, back in the days
I have a R.I.P. sign, on your MySpace page
I'm in your, top 8 nigga, drop 8 nigga
G-C-T Coupe, it's sour grape nigga
I'm a ape nigga, a guerilla in the mist
I HOLD WEIGHT NIGGA~! My connect got bricks
I went gold, you went platinum, we still got the same cars
Same house, and still fuck the same broads (I ain't lyin)
Dreams of fuckin an R&B bitch
Damn you look good girl but get your teeth fixed
I'm the Teflon Don boy, I get busy
Your next two songs you do them shits with Pretty Ricky
Seven-sixty, drive by light tint
With two hoes in the whip lookin like flint

[Chorus]

[Intro]
(Classic) That's right it's a motherfuckin classic!
Yeah... yeah... it's 50 nigga!... Yeah... yeah... yeah. Yeah

[Verse 1]
Smile nigga my next album might be my last
Got what I came to get, the stacks and the stash
I told Jimmy Iovine ass to shut the fuck up
Got Dre callin' Shady sayin Em what's up?
We done came this far, we can't stop now
Em, 50 off the hook, he got to calm down
I guess I'm out of control, my mind, body and soul
Tell me I'm bein pimped and it's makin me sick
You know Em made that company over a billion dollars
And when he ain't around they sayin foul shit about him
Yeah we fucked up, we both don't know our pops
We both don't like the cops, we don't know when to stop
You know Kim is Shaniqua and Hailey is Marquise
D-12's G-Unit and we always in beef
Ja and Fred Durst, both of them jerks
Got put out the game, ha, ha, ya lames!
Paul's Chris Lighty, Tracy's Nicki Martin
Boxes of ox, sarge is a glock
My nine is twenty four seven on watch

[Verse 2]
You know Oprah got In Da Club on her iPod
She don't want me on her show though I guess I'm too hard
She sat Kanye West down, and talked about his crash
But she don't wanna talk about the bullets in my ass
Spike Lee don't like it that my money come fast
I hate it when a nigga get to countin my cash
Now I can give the kids a positive message like Farrakhan
Or I can give 'em pistols and targets to squeeze 'em on
I'm tryin to make a decision damn, leave me alone
I'm like Martin Luther King people listen to me a lot
It's non violent, non violent till I'm hit with a rock
Then it's Coretta fuck this, go and get me my glock
Wanna call me crazy? Okay it's cool
I'll have your kids tryin to be, crazy cool in school
Truth is they like me, more than they like you
They watch me and emulate, everything I do

[Chorus]
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
I have days when I feel like everybody's against me
Sharpton ain't comin when the feds snatch 50
Just my luck Johnnie Cochran passed
Right before the crackers come snatch my ass
I'm the Don King of crack, the Pretty Floyd of rap
Put Southside on the map, I did that
Bill O'Reilly can't stand me but his woman think I'm cute
I bet she wanna see me in my birthday suit
Met Al Gore and his wife in them first class seats
She said she didn't like rap until she met me
You gotta understand I'm a charmin young man
A whole lot has changed since I went hand to hand

[Chorus]
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]

Smile for me! If I gotta go away to make you feel better

My money right, ya nah mean I'm good don't worry 'bout me I'm good
Ya know? This is about you now, is it 'gon make you happy to see me gone?
Are you gonna miss me when I'm gone?
Are you just gonna forget about me? I meant nothin to you?
Is that what you sayin to me? 
Cause ya breakin my heart...
Hahaha, I mean you're really breakin my heart

Did him dirty and ran away, who's the next candidate?
Get hit with the cannon AY! You lil' niggaz wan' play
We can go back and forth in broad day
Let it off, hop in the rental car, pull away smooth
Put that twerk in that work and we at you with the tools
Nigga we ain't sellin packs no more so we ain't on the strip
Got that llama in the 'Llac strapped leanin in the whip

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
First I find your bitch creep, then we found a nail shop
Now would you looky here, we done found your momma's spot
It's so easy, damn I'm greasy
Goons don't use Auto-Tune, that's Yeezy
Yeah, summer now, good time to hunt you down
Keep the pump around, we catch him we gon' slump him now
Timin is everything, I plot it out perfect
Drop a bag off to my nigga just to make it worth it

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]

When you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
Catch him in a hoopty, squeeze hit him through the do'

[50 Cent]
It's nuttin to it, cock it, bang it and get rid of that
Hit his fitted cap, he won't get a chance to Twitter that
I make the Ruger sing a song, bullets hum to you
You better have God wit'chu when I come to you
I'm a grimy nigga, I said some simple shit
You's a dirty nigga with syphilis on your dick
I catch you I'ma wash you up, line you, spit-shine you
Leave you right there in the street, where niggaz can find you
Die nigga die, fly pelican fly
When I pull it eat a bullet, don't question me why
What's the laws of the jungle, I'll show you what the gun do
My bad, what the shell do; you rot until they smell you

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Get green son get him, cut his head
He didn't even see it comin, he sleepin that's what he did
Get biz, niggaz actin like it ain't what it is
Let the knife work push the blade up in his shit
Let Doc come sew him up, gang signs throw 'em up
In my hood growin up - you pussy or you bout it
You shootin or you runnin, the police comin
Niggaz get at you, you get at them or you don't mean nuttin
Niggaz walk tough, even walk like warriors
On some G shit they get to singin like Gloria
Now come clean, tell us what you told the D's
Matter fact don't tell us shit, motherfucker hold this

[Chorus]

Please don't interrupt me when I'm talkin to my jeweler
He's puttin them diamonds all over my Franck Muller

Come through hit you up, I'll make a crime scene perfect
Niggaz talk about me all the time behind my back
They don't talk about me in my face because I'm strapped
See me in the club, I got that Henny and that 'gnac
A couple cups of that and I just don't know how to act
By the second bottle that's when I just get to buzzin
I say I run New York and ain't nobody sayin nothin (okay okay okay)

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I blew a hundred G's on my bitches in Miami
They think I'm the sweetest thing invented since candy
Me I catch amnesia when you ask me 'bout the shotty
I don't even know my name, switchin lanes in my Bugatti
Nigga I ain't crazy, bitches like me cause I'm paid
They want me, LeBron, Kobe or Dwyane Wade
When I say I'm ballin I'm not talkin 'bout a ball
I'm talkin 'bout Tiffany & Co. stones out the mall
Niggaz they can hate all they want but they know they like this
Me I'm like that paintin on the wall, baby I'm priceless
You could come and work me over baby on the night shift
Catch me on the night shift, see how freaky I get (okay okay okay)

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Okay okay okay okay - sho' you right
Okay okay okay okay - you know you right
Okay, alright, okay, alright
Okay, alright, okay, you're right

{"Oh it's too late, oh it's too late"}

[50 Cent]
If I hit him I'll hurt him, I just catch him and murk him
I'm not sittin here waitin for him to come back ? naw!
Soon as I spot him I got him, I'ma run up and drop him
Get that P-90 poppin, nigga hold that ? uhh!
I get the gun and they runnin, niggaz know me for dumbin
I got a good reputation, what the fuck can I say
Some of these niggaz is bitches, yeah most of 'em snitches
So I don't let 'em know it's me, doin dirt when it's me
I know just how to work it, I can make it go perfect
Have the homicides sittin there, scratchin their head
To me a victim's a victim, you could pay me and pick 'em
Then I hunt him down and take his head off like I dare ya

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I bet you think that I'm vicious, catch you huggin and kissin
While the love's in the air, I put a hole in your heart
Plus so now that I'm missin, I'm a fuckin magician
You might find my DNA, all over your broad
Me and my cannibal methods, I eat you niggaz for breakfast
See the cannon respect it, nigga take off the chain (now!)
Robberies turn to murder, I do shit you ain't heard of
Change my mind and just pop you, in a blink of an eye
I know you thought I was bluffin, but to me this is nothin
Now you can lay there, leakin, go 'head curl up and die
You tell God when you see him, I'll be happy to meet him
I went to service this evenin, he forgives, not I

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
It's murder
Nothin but murder

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Cash Rules, I keep a shooter 'round me, Queens!
Get the money, I have a nigga killed y'all (killed y'all)
Kill the hood, ask niggaz 'bout me, Jesus!
For the money, niggaz'll go real hard (real hard)

[50 Cent]
You are now under my hypnosis
Summertime grind, come out with the toasters

New money breathe, new enemies, nigga you know this
Another mil', another nigga sick
I got nothin but hard dick for your bitch to lick
I box you orthodox out boy, outlaw bricks of raw
I'm out in the grind, I make the dope price soar
Shit cool 'til the mac out, run when it back out
A nigga finna blackout, better pray that bitch jam
It's in God's hands, it's all God plan
You mean even when a nigga gettin smoked, goddamn

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I push my pen with passion, I'm the author of the struggle
When pain is a head crack, designer of the devil
Trip' 6-6-6, I'm back on my bullshit
See clear through my third eye; it's gon' be a murda
E'ry summer, e'ry winter, e'ry spring
You think I'm bullshittin I put that on e'rything
The shootin gon' stop right after the shit-talkin
I was sellin crack while Mike was moonwalkin
20 off a pack, I stack, I can't call it
I blast ya like NASA, Jack, you outta orbit
I mean you outta order, you don't want me to send a nigga to you
So he could put some hot shit through you, do you?

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, I'm back baby I'm back!
New shit, the drought over, new product
Yeah, man I can't fit in with these niggaz man
I mean niggaz got mohawks, they wearin skinny jeans man
I think these niggaz is faggots man, for real man
They with the rainbow club man
You think this shit is a fad? C'mon man!
I think it's more than that man

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
They think, I'm a fool
Cause I'd do so many things, for you

Then you wan' chitter-chat, now what kind of shit is that?
Strip club, shake it shake it, toss it up, make it rain
Semi tucked, I let it buck, I shoot the shit up out your gang
Find out who you're fuckin with cause I ain't for the sucker shit
Cut you like the cocaine, niggaz stay in yo' lane
I'm a muh'fuckin heavyweight, you ain't in my weight class
And me I'm movin heavy weight, get gone with your light ass
Me I'm so official, pearl-handled nickel

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]

I come through that muh'fucker wavin the chopper
113th Precinct ain't enough to stop us
Niggaz shot at me before I got away, popped from a block away
Sucker niggaz be right there on one foot 'til I rock away
Next day I popped up, told niggaz it's my turf
They done seen the gun smoke, they done found my shells burn
Sabrina baby special, they treat me like a misfit
I squeeze {*rnnn-rnnn*} I risk it, I risk it
Different class of nigga, my hand around the trigger
Don't make me do it, I'll do it you stupid nigga

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]

Get the message, come out and get my message

[50 Cent]
I was a itty-bitty nigga when Prince killed Drake
I'm a shooter, ask Bizzy, he made us that way
I spend seven-and-a-half hours baggin up grams
Gotta watch these niggaz with the sticky-ass hands
See my face, do a hundred grams chopped on the mirror
Tell me I can't eat, I ain't tryin to hear it
JoJo wanted the bitches, I was tryin get my weight up
Nigga get in the way and get shot down, straight up
I'm grimy, yeah my friends killed my friends
Like Blackey, he did that shit to him
Get at me, I'm back strapped up again
I tried, I can't change, I'll always be the same
I tell my lil' niggaz fuck pray
And any motherfucker down with 'em can suck me - I'm still mad
I got the cream to make a murder scene
If y'all niggaz ain't shootin y'all can't fuck with me, come fuck with me

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
The D's kick my door, got knocked with a half a brick

You can't park 'round here while I'm down here
I shot Chris whip up, he came back shot Richie head
But that ain't who he aim for, get who you came for
Apollo, amateur night, your name is in lights
I don't clown, I get down, I'm a different breed
Yeah, wait until these jokers get a load of me
I watch your clique like a flick, find your backbone
Line 'em up nice, come through with the mac blowin
Beef ain't nothin new to me, it's all a repeat
I leave a shooter by your door to make your ass sleep
Now come out come out, find out what I'm about
That Ruger, that luger, I air your ass out

[Chorus]

My occupation's operation get money
Got that beam on that 9; got that money on my mind
Got no patience, man I grind like I'm runnin out of time
See the sun shine reflect off my shine, you're blind
You write hot lines like mine lines, you're signed
That bitch bad, her ass so fat class she mine
I'm addicted to it, me I got to win
Over and over and over again
This quest for the paper is never gon' end
So to my competition here's the message I send

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Man you ain't a shooter, you ain't a robber
You talk like a mobster, you fuckin blogger
I say some hard shit you wan' say somethin harder
Smack the shit out you, you wan' run to the law huh?
This movie's a rerun, you seen this before
She used a vibrator and she suck on your boy
I stand out like a sore thumb, I'm hard to ignore
You get addicted to the dick then have to go through withdrawals
After I go through the drawers, I'm back on my grizzly
Back gettin busy, causin a frenzy
It's nuttin new to me, there's nuttin they could do to me
that ain't been done to me - this is fun for me

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
One... one-two... grrrr!

I had five hundred grams and fifty in 58 bags
Fo'-hundred Benz, eight thousand in cash
Then the ball dropped, gun popped, banks got blast
I make it so hot, one shot'll melt yo' ass
Got popped up, cried 'til my eyes turned red
Then told myself in the mirror "Nigga you ain't dead"
I'm far from eccentric, I'm so psychotic
I don't need you to shoot for me, nigga I got it!
When you see me in the hood muh'fucker don't talk to me
'Less you wan' talk about usin the hawk for me
When Al blew Black away I had him on some stupid shit
Then my rap shit worked, now I'm super stupid rich
All I do is stunt now, I'm so Maybach
There I go frontin again, I meant to say laid back
Go 'head move reckless, get banged for your necklace
I serve him with the semi, feed him a clip for breakfast

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You want some? Come get some
Nigga it's murder one when I toss my gun
You might see me let it off, you might see me run
But you won't see shit time the po-lice come
Huh? You want some? Come get some
Nigga it's murder one when you see my gun
I just squeeze and squeeze 'til the whole clip done
You just bleed and bleed 'til the po-lice come
Huh? You want some?

[50 Cent]
I got a eighth of dope left, half a pound of purple
Shooters in my circle, try me I'll let 'em murk you
Got more guns than a gun store, beef ain't what you want boy
You wan' be nice to me; you wan' shoot dice with me
You want a ace on purpose, why you so nervous?
Nigga we from the same hood, we come from the same shit
You got gonorrhea too? We fucked with the same bitch
Gettin money is necessary; see me I'm a visionary
And I'm sayin that house, should be a crack house
Now see it how I see it or I'll bring the straps out
The tec and the mac out, they sick in the Taurus
The coat and that Heckler, then nigga we warrin
I let my pistols speak for me and all of 'em foreign
Click-clack, comprende? I'm criminal-minded
Toss my Nina in the sewer, bet nobody find it
'Til it's rusty and fucked up forensics have fun, what!

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Come get it, I'm strapped now, I'm wit it
Come get it - huh? You want some?
Come get it, I'm strapped now, I'm wit it
Fuck that nigga! Huh? You want some?

[Intro]
This is how monsters function

Leave me alone
I ain't fucking with nobody

[Verse]
Keep fucking with me you going turn me back to Boo Boo
Have me casing out your crib, trying to pop your fucking noodles
She was 20, I was 12, man my Nana said she raped me
I just smiled from ear to ear, saying take me baby, take me
Since high school, nigga I ain't got no friends
Got two 3-80s like the Ying Yang Twins, Ahh
That's spot clicking till the Ds run in
Then it's bail money and lawyer fees, you got to have ends
Freshman year I had that CBR Hurricane
In a ill Herringbone I got them swinging Heroine
I shoot a nigga in a heartbeat I ain't no chump
Then you can run Forrest run, retard when I dump
They take kindness for weakness, niggas don't respect that
So me I'm where that Reuger, that Pump and that Tech at
Some look at me I'm on now, I thought we was rich then
Shipment, but you had like, twenty bricks in Richmond
We was in Cocaine heaven, I was fishscale dreaming
We just got in the town, we was strapped up scheming
First Country caught a body, then Country caught a body then
I popped a couple niggas then Country shot everybody
It's cold blooded, it's real shit you got to love it
Tre-Eight Snub it, and don't think nothing of it
It's the way of the wolves, it's how they train us to move
Get it popping when we shopping niggas hold down the tools

[Chorus]
I seen niggaz getting rich
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I was tired of not having shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I seen niggaz getting hit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
We was slinging that shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
Here I am

[Verse] 
Unsure since we was little niggas, son since we were seven
Armed robbery, first degree, my man did seven
Niggas popped his whip up, hit his Camry with a seven
He a lucky muhfucker I bet he make it to heaven
My Grandpa drunk, my uncle Rock drunk
My uncle Champ pump crack, smoked my fucking stash up
I had 250 grams stashed on the porch
I mean, how much you going to smoke, man? how much you going to snort?
First the VCR went, then the TV went
He stole out of mommy purse, she thought it was me, kid
I ain't ask her for no money son cause I was out hustling
She was looking at me sideways like I'm a thief or something
That hurt me, come on son that wouldn't hurt you?
I pistol whip that nigga till his face was purple
I need anger management, see I hold on to a grudge
The same way I hold on to that nickel-plate Snub

[Bridge]
The Lord don't have imperfections baby
So I think I'm perfect the way he made me
Some say I'm cool, some say I'm crazy
Some say I ain't shit, some say I'm amazing

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Dre, niggas think we're bullshitting

[Chorus]
Nigga try me son, he best have the heat on him
Want my eyes closed, get to mopping the street with him
Boy I put your body in a bag, front on me, I'm on ya ass
I bring money to my niggas, that bring death to my enemies
I bring money to my niggas, that bring death to my enemies

[Verse 1]
Nigga front on me, the goons and goblins come out
Wishmaster hundred shot drums will run out
They dumb out, you heard of me, they call me big homie
Me, I make the register ring, I'm the cash cow
They make the hammers ring, you on your ass now
Hair trigger, stare nigga, yeah niggas'll flip
Six to a semi assault, let it off at your will
Here I is, where the money is, I still get biz
D's know about the beef, you going to still get did
It be your tombstone and your fucking grave they dig
Have that ass in the precinct trying to talk to the pigs
I'm like Damien nigga, when I start getting loose on you
Closest thing to Lucifer, you think you got a noose on you
I make it hard to breathe
I come where your hustle, air it out, make it hard to eat
Have you looking both ways like you crossing the street

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Niggas send me the wrong message, we going fucking kill the messenger
Your whole clique, hollow tips will tear up the best of you
This ain't +Tha Carter+ nigga, this is Sparta
It's harder, I die and be a martyr, respect me like your father
Let off a clip or let a case off
I have your pussy ass running like a race horse
Follow orders now, Yay shoot his face off
You can have one, blast one, it's mad fun
See how when you listen to me all of the cash come
I was born with the Tec, it's a birth defect
I was conceived in the bins, ended up in a Benz
This is what happens when have-nots turn into sasquatch
Let the gat pop, boogie down on the back blocks
It's horrific, nah it's terrific
I got it if you sniff it, go head nigga twist it
Get lifted, goddamn I'm gifted

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I tell them ride on them, then they ride on them
Get the line on them then squeeze the .9 on them
Head shot, .40 glock, blow his mind on him
They say ain't not a jooks, leave his shines on his
Now you can watch me, nigga like the police watch me
I move proper, go ahead catch a shell trying to stop me
That 4-30 Spider, carbon fibre
And my dog is like Al Qaeda, natural fighter
Rapid fire, you're sweet like apple cider
The Mack will fire, mask like Michael Myers
It's off the wire when I get on my bullshit
No smiles, no laughs, you gets no pass
You can explain to my niggas while they whoop your ass
My hands itch when the money comes, it's hard to explain it
Last time I itched like this a truckload came in
Get money, get bread, that's what I do kid

[Chorus]

[Intro]
I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful

[Verse One]
Your daddy fucked your mama then fucked your sister
Then climbed in the bed playin with your sugar
Go 'head, take your belt off and hang yourself
Matter a fact grab your strap and bang yourself
Jay's a big man, he's too big to respond
I'm a big dick you know the one everybody's on
You 'gon make me sing Murder Was The Case
Pull this richter shit PING PING should you start to face
I'm international I'm never home mayne!!!
I've been gone so long my accent changed
You better watch who you fuck with mate
Or you 'gon make me carve your ass up now straight
Come on Game you will never be my equal!
Your homies shoot, doors my niggas shoot people!
See me I'm what you never 'gon be
I'm in that tax bracket you never 'gon see

[Chorus]
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful

[Verse Two]
That nigga Buck a fiend, tell momma he done smoked the TV
I ain't know he fucked with more dope than B.G.
Plus a nigga sipped more syrup than Pepsi
Man keepin these muthafuckers rich ain't easy
Especially when a nigga wanna stunt like Jeezy
And his CDs' didn't sell like his CDs'
Man, that nigga blew all of his chips on dem breezies
Mad 'cause the world won't treat him like Weezy
Look I don't give a FUCK, nigga please believe me
No nigga in no vocal booth around can see me
It's crazy how I make this shit look oh so easy
They say, "50, naw I don't fuck wit him, he oh so greasy
Yeah, he used to share that paper now he oh so greedy"
It's funny how they shit on niggas, then they need me
See me I'm number one, I'm loadin up my gun
I catch ya if you done, you pussy nigga run

[Chorus]
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful

[Verse Three]
They say first comes love, then comes marriage
Instead I got Shanequa in a baby carriage
Then came the cash then the baby mama drama
I gave that bitch a half a mill she blew it on Prada
I remember when I met the bitch and she ain't have nada
Got my son on some fly shit, now I gotta buy shit
Man I can't even flaunt shit cause everybody want shit
Everybody mad, DAMN even my dad
And I don't even know him now how the fuck I owe him?!
I ain't given nobody shit I'm a show them
I gave Game hits and told me to suck dick
Start screamin Westside and Dre ain't say shit!!!
Now we just eat off him, and when I talk to Em
A smile comes on his face, he told me here's the case
Enemies stay enemies but friends they change
Niggas go crazy over money my mayne!!!!

[Chorus]
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Eminem]
You see I'm a psycho (Psycho) A sicko (A sicko) I'm crazy (I'm crazy)
I said I got my knife boy (Knife boy)
I'll kill you (I'll kill you) If you make me (If you make me)
They wanna see my shot up (Shot up)
Locked up (Locked up) Then cage me (Then cage me)
I come back bigger (Bigger) Stronger
(Stronger) And angry (And angry)

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
Yeah! Look look I come from a different crew you fuck with me I'll get to you
A clip or two I'll cripple you just cause I ain't got shit to do
Pistol pop a pussy drop, drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie mini moe, Nine, Trey pound or Forty fo'
Pick a strap then take the Mac the Hawk I stab it in your back
I'll blow your brains I know your name and where you rest I make a mess
The hollow tips will hit your chest you cough up blood till EMS
Come pick you up you know your fucked when you get on the stretcher
Cause I come into ICU to see you off to Heaven
The system I done been through it there's nothin new done to me
They lock me up they let me out you seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals while they up in corrections
They come home get a Nine then commit crime in perfection
It's murder one they found a gun now they doin ballistics
But they can't find a fingerprint the shit's goin terrific
Get so close on your target that it's really hard to miss it 

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Eminem]
Man these are average raps, I'm keepin the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath clique
You pop off the top, it's like openin vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch yeah there's somethin to jack a batch in
Impregnated then chewed up the embryo sack with Mac-10s'
Triplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins
That fetus is fallin out all over, Jack is back again
The Ripper's at your service, girl I can see that you're nervous
But I barely scratch the surface, llke my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fuckin backyard, still tryin to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out?
It's past your curfew when it's dark, I'm searchin for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop
'Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI, they hate us but they gotta give a lot of props
The drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

[Verse Three: Eminem]
Yeah, I'm as ill as can be
My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me
Killin' so villainously
Still as maniacal on the night goin psycho as Michael Myers 
You know what we're like on the muthafuckin mic, so try us 
and you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers

[Verse Four: 50 Cent]
It's operation time they got him hooked up the wires
Squeezin me bleedin wheezin breathin he half dead
He must ain't know but now he know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Led showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn!!!
School of arts, truly y'all, you better learn learn!!!

[Verse Five: Eminem]
Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah homie, turn turn
I'm debatin, mutilatin the lady
You've been waitin for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicatin it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her, I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's I squashed her
I put her on the ringer and hung her over the wash tub

[Verse Six: 50 Cent]
When I'm through with Ricky It'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk witness this shit end up nautious
Look deep in my eye see many many men die
I swing gemstars faster than Samurai

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama, you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me
Down

[Verse 1]
Through every altercation
I put no one above you, MM-MM I love you
They shook up when we jooks 'em
You see how they be lookin'
It's frightening like lightning
You crack off, they start bookin'
It's beef until I get out
In broad day with my shit out
That's when they say I'm illin'
And when she get to killin'
Now my baby she precious
I warn you not to test this
I aim her at your head nigga
Motherfuck the vestes
I'm antisocial, quit acting like you know me
Before I go postal, you know I gotta owe me
I'm ridin' with her ol' cocked
Audi R8 drop
Feel the wind blow
Twist the indo
Smoke it up, it's fundamental
You can't get to her, poke 'em up
When we get intimate
That's when I get into shit
She 32 I'm 34, I fuck her raw
She revolve 6 times then I feed her more

[Chorus]
I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama, you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me
Down

[Verse 2]
When niggas get to trippin'
I need you by my side, yeah, so they can't catch me slippin'
I take you out shoppin',
Get you clean, get it poppin'
Use my finger, get ya hot girl
I know your spot, yeah
I love you if you love me back
You never jam when I react
To sucka shit
When they get hit
And we take off
If you get tossed
I'll be back
I want you so I'll be back
I'll never change

A nigga stunt I let it rain

I'll hit you up you think I'm playin'
I be strapped
Go 'head fuck around, I be strapped
24/7
I'm back holdin', mistake me for a chump
Bite off more than you can chew, more beef than you want
Come through repeatedly, show you what bananas about
I'm a mechanic, find out when the hammers come out

[Chorus]
I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama, you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me
Down

Your favorite bad guy's gone, the Joker's dead
So from now until forever you're stuck with the kid
I ain't supposed to be a boss, I'm supposed to be an enforcer
I'm supposed to hold a gun, not be stuck in the office
Michael pimped me? I was in the passenger seat
He was comfortable with me 'round cause I blast my heat
'9-4 I was tryin to catch Mason for bricks of raw
Charlie fucked up the jux, they took Nana's little boy - streeeeetch
The cocaine, I go hard when the drought come
When the straps come out son niggaz know the outcome
Lay low, stay low, you may see Jesus
Get hit with a stray yo for no fuckin reason
You prayin for a Benz, it's a blessin you breathin
It's a miracle that God gave me this tec, now I'm eatin

In different boroughs I have different moments
On different days niggas know how I'm on it
I'm pretty like a Harlem nigga, I'm a shooter like a Brooklyn nigga
I'm a hustler don't get no bigger

Now one's a fuckin junkie, and one's a fuckin queer
Now it's three of us, that's the way we started

Wrists rocked up shinin, flawless diamonds
You could hardly see the face on my Audemar time and
On that J.T. shit, me I'm bringin +Sexy Back+
Louis belt wrapped around right where the tec be at

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Gettin paper's my objective, yup, now your chain gone
One false move and CLAP, now your brain's gone
You like me, you aight with me; me? I'm into me
I destroy my enemies, even if they're kin to me
Do 'em like the Kennedy's, ching-ching that's mo' bread
Say somethin slick out yo' mouth I'll come for yo' head
She likes me more than you can imagine
Bad bitch, look like she fell up out a pageant
Closest I'ma get to heaven in this lifetime
is right below her waist, in between her thighs
Call her Pussycat, that's my nickname for her
And I ain't got to buy shit or run game on her
See when I stunt she stunt, we stunt together
Oh you don't like how that sound? Aw nigga whatever
We both rock Bugarri, both push Ferraris
I go so hard in the paint, I'm sorry!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
You want me? I want you
Plug one? Plug two
I'm infinitely special, girl the Lord's gonna bless you
if you do what I tell you to do
You want me? I want you
You want Benz? I'll buy two
You should want me like you want success
Girl with us together we'll be better than the best
Why settle for less?

[Chorus]

Girl I want you to give me what you got and give me more
Girl you can start on top or on fours
You know I like it, when you get into it
Don't nobody do it, uh, like I do it
Feel the rush, from my touch, get intoxicated
Drunk off my love, call the Hennesey thug
Passion, ya laughin, I can make you smile on the regular
Tell me what you want, shorty, that's what I'ma get ya
Yeah, I need you to be what I need, more than liquor or weed
I need you to maybe give me a seed
I need you to give me reason to breathe
I need you, I'm tellin this so you know what I need 
I'd be a part-time or full-time lovers, a meant-to-be lover 
Don't matter which way it go, I'm oh so gutta 
Girl you could get it however you wan' get it

"D-D-Do you, do-do, do you think about me?"
"Do you, do you, do you think about me?"
"Do you think, do you think, do-do-do you think about me?"
"Do you, do you, do you, do you think about me?"

[50 Cent]
Uhh, yeah
You think about money when you think about me, huh?
It's why my ex my ex, you don't wan' be her
She used to have the Beemer, now she own a sneaker
I had her eatin lobster, now she eatin pizza
I think about Easter when I think about Keyshia
Shorty stay fly, that's why I keep her
Round like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa
She good if I leave her, she got her own Visa
Think about them when you think about frontin
Think about stuntin when you think about me
I'm the boss, Bentley or the Porsche?
Overseas see jet skis slide across
I love the way you dress, now take it off
Put your legs high on my shoulders of course
I'm racin through your mind, but you already lost
I'm at the finish line, and you're a friend of mine
C'mon let's ride

[Chorus: Governor]
{"Do you think about me?"}
Just a little bit, every now and then
{"Do you think about me?"}
Goddamn girl! We used to be friends
{"Do you think about me?"}
Just a little bit, just a little bit
{"Do you think about me?"}
Just a little bit, just a little bit!
{"Do you think about me?"}

[50 Cent]
I think like a hustler, I'm thinkin 'bout a shipment
She thinkin I'm her hustler, she thinkin 'bout commitment
It's like Paul McCartney's stuck in my head
He fell in love with one bitch who walked away on one leg
She ain't even have to run to get away with the bread
That's some fucked up shit, think about that kid
I'm thinkin "What this bitch thinkin when she take me to court?
I pay my child support, what the fuck she want?"
This relationship shit is too much for me
I wanna fuck, be friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow mines on shoppin sprees
She should have what she want, just not from me
I'm thinkin 'bout my future, she brought up my past
She don't care about me, she just want some cash
I'm thinkin damn, girl we used to be friends
How did shit become all about ends?

[Chorus]

[Governor]
(Do you think about meeeee?) Do you think about me?
(I know you think about meeeee)
You GOT to remember all the good times we had!
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit!
(Oooooooooooooh, do you think about meeeee?)
I remember when you told me
(I know you think about meeeee)
That I'll ALWAYYYYYS be special to you darlin
You were so special to me, do you think about me?
Ohhh

[Interlude]

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah! 50! 

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
I gave her books to read, fed her mind with knowledge
Gave her street smarts, shit you can't get in college
She's a reflection of me, 'til you know she the shit
If I'm a star she a star, If I'm rich she rich
That's my dog, I tell her stay she wanna go
I tell her go she wanna stay
That's my dog, you a bitch don't usually mean nothin to me, that's right
But that's my dog I go left, she go right, I go up, she go down
She couldn't listen that, she ain't around
So ungrateful, screamin I hate you, she must got amnesia, bitch I made you
Now, just think, just think that could've been you
Just think, that should've been you
Yeah, wit me, I share the world with you
But you ain't ride with a rider so I ain't fuckin with you

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Say, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, gooooo!!
The reason you didn't get dick
because you got your nose up your ass like your smellin your shit
But tonight you met your match (WHOOOOOA OHHHHHH WHYYYYYY!!!)
Cause I be smellin my shit too now how you like that?!
You could've had this dude and anything you choose 
And now girl you lose cause I ain't fuckin with ya
(Could've been you!!!) Shoppin sprees, drop top hair blowin in the wind
(Could've been you!!!) Livin lavish instead it's your girlfriend
But you trippin, while we sippin, in the back of the club big tippin!!

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Some say it hurts when you supposed to win, then you lose
You were supposed to be sure, baby you was confused
I had a thang for ya, I had a ring for ya
House, cars, kids and a pet, and name for ya
Pussycat told ya I make it, you ain't believe
I guess 'cause comin up was hard, it was easy to leave
Now think about it, maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Either way shorty, life goes on (For sure!)
When you around, my smile's a grin, my thoughts are a sin
You ask me can we try again, I ain't fuckin witchu (Naw!)
It's on, the club jumpin, I'm tryna get my liquor and
You wanna suck the dick again, I'm starin at your thicker friends (Wassup ma?)
I guess I'm like Will Smith in "Pursuit of Happyness"
In my hood, we all hustle and in pursuit of the same shit
Now just think (Just think) That could've been you
Now just think that should've been you, with me
I share the world witchu,
but you ain't ride with a rider, so I ain't fuckin witchu

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Say, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, gooooo!!
The reason you didn't get dick
because you got your nose up your ass like your smellin your shit
But tonight you met your match (WHOOOOOA OHHHHHH WHYYYYYY!!!)
Cause I be smellin my shit too nut how you like that?!
You could've had this dude and anything you choose 
And now girl you lose cause I ain't fuckin with ya
(Could've been you!!!) Shoppin sprees, drop top hair blowin in the wind
(Could've been you!!!) Livin lavish instead it's your girlfriend
And it ain't no other way to put it except
I know you understand it girl it's so...
But you see us in the back of the club
poppin bottles and it could've been you, but nope!!!!

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Said it could've been......could've been you yeah!!!!!!
Said it could've been......It could've been yooouuuuuuuu!!!!!

[Intro]
From the day you're born, 'til the day you die...
If you're one of the poor ones you just gotta work hard

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider

[50 Cent]
They puttin pressure on me son now they want me to snap
End up like X and Whitney in my mansion smokin crack
I'm paranoid, I'm feelin like niggaz is tryin to get me
Forget the kids I'm shavin off my fuckin head like Britney
Man Dre won't mix my records now I need to talk to Jimmy
I'm fallin back in my old ways I'm ridin with the semi
Who's callin me? It's Chris he's on the other line with Diddy
But I don't wanna talk right now, my day is goin shitty
Why's Jay rockin that Urkel look, man isn't he from Marcy?
They say he's growin dreads and now he's talkin like a Yardi
Man everything is changin, I don't understand a thing
I guess this is that bullshit that all the money brings
I'm on flight

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
My baby mama boyfriend like to talk like he can hurt me
I'm laughin cause she kissed him in his mouth and gave him herpes
That just makes him one of 50 niggaz wantin to murk me
Niggaz found my truck and burnt it up out there in Jersey
You can ask my son, he'll tell you "My dad's fuckin crazy
She filled his head with shit and now I think he fuckin hates me"
Shady didn't invent me but a star is what he made me
I'll blow your fuckin mind out if I told you what he paid me
He gave me all the pills he had left, that's why I'm so high
It makes me feel so good now that I'm not so scared to die
I wish a nigga would, I dare a motherfucker try
You get at me and miss you kiss yo' black ass good-bye
I'm on flight

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
My lawyers all contained cause every month I give 'em stacks
In case they wanna send me up for murder like Max
Man I wasn't the shooter, I was never on the scene
So if they do forensics they'll find out it wasn't me
There's no need for a lie detector, I ain't sayin shit
The more you talk the higher chances you're doin a bid
Today I read the paper, it said Tru Life caught a case
They said they found a victim with a knife stuck in his face
I spoke to Michael Vick, I told him I'm happy he home
You tell them crackers sorry nigga then you get back on
When dogs are fightin in the hood nobody gives a fuck
So you get back and shake it on the field, show them what's up
I'm on flight

[Chorus]

[Intro: sample of 50 Cent's "I Get Money"]

Shawty said take it off, I'll take it off
Climb right out of my clothes
Want me to break you off, I'll break you off
'Til your love come down on yo' walls
I'm extremely focused, sweatin I'm strokin
I better get you open
I'll leave your headboard broken, you think I'm jokin
I bet I'll get you open

[50 Cent]
First it's her neck, yeah then her back
Yeah I'm a freak, I get into all that

Switch gears slow down, go down whoa now
You can feel every inch of it when we intimate
I'll use my tongue baby, I'll leave you sprung maybe
I'll have ya head spinnin sayin "50's so crazy"

Ha ha! Said what you sayin boy, boy? (boy)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
See, the weak get walked on, the soft get barked on
See me, I never ever ever runnnn
Niggaz say the wrong shit to me, like he wan' do me
Somebody lead him with my gunnnn

Watch your mouth girl, this a man's world
What you sayin boy? You think I'm playin boy?

[50 Cent]
Listen nigga you play me, and I'ma go crazy
You push me I'ma motherfuckin trip
I come trippin through yo' set, bustin off my tec
I gives a fuck if you's a Blood or a Crip
Nigga from J.F.K. to L.A.X. I'm back through the sets again
Gangsta life that's right, crazy-ass Mexicans
Do it the raw way, broad day, AK
Spray cause a melee, mayday mayday!
Freak bitch suck me on tape like Ray J
Niggaz that I'm up against know they can't fade me
I'm the last one, you know the last don
She know she wan' come, bitch bring ya ass on!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
See I come from the Southside where niggaz is outside
Right now with the rubber grips
Niggaz say they gon' see me, to hit 'em on G.P.
Then I bless 'em with the chains full of bricks
When you come from where I'm from, you come from the bottom
They ain't supposed to get this rich
So the Fed's got my phone tapped to treat me like Fat Cat
Now I'm thinkin "Man ain't this a bitch!"
Niggaz stick cola in cola, from movin the yola
Next thing you know they up in yo' crib
Sayin where's the stash at? You move they gon' blast that
So I suggest you stand still kid

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
This a man's world...
Watch your mouth girl, this a man's world

[Intro: skit]
"Police search for clues on the Q-111 bus where two people were shot, one fatally."
  "We heard like a few shots ring out, and uh, you know 
   by living in neighborhoods, familiar with those sounds we knew it was gunshots.
   So automatically y'know we start taking cover 
   cause we didn't know which direction they were coming from."
"Police say it all started in South Jamaica about 2-and-a-half miles 
 away from the shooting on the bus at Jamaica Station."
   "I was trying to get away from the area, after the first shot.
    It was very traumatizing to me, like I've seen this happen a lot of times.
    Didn't wanna be involved.
    I did not wanna be, that person that get a stray bullet or nothing like that."
"Police have arrested a 34 year-old man.
 They believe he is responsible for both shooting incidents.
 They also recovered a handgun.
 He was arrested not far from here near Jamaica Station.
 In Jamaica Queens, Zack Fink, New York 1."

[50 Cent]
It's "The Big 10"
It's, it's been ten years since "50 Cent is the Future"
Psh, I'm tired as a muh'fucker man

{"What you want me to be, I've tried to see"}

[50 Cent]
Yeah bitch I got my second wind, you could pretend I ain't the shit
I'm guilty I'm guilty, yeah I'm filthy fuckin rich
I'm strapped Your Honor, new mac, my armor
Point blank, matchin my bullet-proof persona
New version of Dahmer, pussy-eatin piranha
My tongue touch her flesh, your bitches say I'm the best
Them crackers say I'm racial, wait a cotton-pickin minute!
Now I'm racial, cause I done put "cotton-pickin" in it
Put a knot on your fuckin head, yeah that'll happen first
I'll put a dot on your fuckin head, you end up in a hearse
They say I play mind games, warrior mindframe
These bitch niggaz, always forget to say my name
Go 'head, I want you to, you four, I'm onto you
I'm so strategic you wouldn't believe it
And they know it, every time I come around
Pit stop and they tend to quiet down
Gotta know about me

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
My nine got a extended clip on it
My Tec got all kinda shit on it
Inf' beam, hollow tips, rubber grip on it
Night vision through the sight when I grip on it
My nine got a extended clip on it
My Tec got all kinda shit on it
My pound got a body on it, body on it
My man put a body on it, body on it

[50 Cent]
I read a blog
They said I ain't got it, I still got it, oh Lord
Look who's gonna meet the edge of my sword
I'm takin off now bitch, all aboard
If you wanna ride; fuck it, let's ride
It seems like, principle livin's startin to fade
Even in a gangsta's life, niggaz is snakes
No loyalty, rats rattin on members of their gang
Funny they were family before the pigs came

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah~! This one right here marks the decade of hot shit
If a nigga say I fell off, all I want you to do is ask him when
What they gon' say, what, the "Curtis" album?
Okay so #1's not good enough
I gave you "Ayo Technology" that was #1
"I Get Money," that wasn't hot?
So tell me when I fell off? Yeah
When I gave you motherfuckers what you asked for, with "Before I Self Destruct"
you looked at me and was like, 'We cool Fif'!'
You know why? Cause I won too much in front of you niggaz
That's why, but it's cool
I take a break, I come back, so hot you can't deny it
It's your boy 50
This one right here is for the haters, for real
I want you to eat a dick; don't suck a dick, eat a dick
Chew it, hahahaha

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Kidd Kidd)
Niggas be schemin, fiendin
They cut your jooks, they off the hook, I come through there look how they look
I'm ridin leanin, they dreamin they do me dirty
If they could I'm lookin like I wish you would
(Try me, go 'head, try me) Niggas be schemin, dreamin
(Try me have you hooked to I-V) Niggas be schemin, dreamin

[Verse One: Kidd Kidd]
Mad niggaz wan' do me dirty, I'm fresh out the tub
You move like a snail you deserve to catch a slug
Man I wake up huggin my bitch
One with the extended clip, not the one that I'm with (uh)
If you all made men then you know shit real
They got change on the mic, I ain't tryin to see 'em killed
I told 'em that's my cuz, I don't wanna see nothin happen to him
Cuase when I start spittin at him I ain't rappin to him
Yeah I'm jumpin in that water like a diver
Six shot survivors, school of hard knock scholars
These niggaz ain't riders, they hiders, they cowards
I feel like 50, hold +Power of a Dollar+
I told my nigga give me one of them bullet-proof trucks
I want you dumb enough to try and shoot it up
I'm lookin at the nigga lettin off
Wait until you finish the clip, laugh then pulled off
Huh~!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Kidd Kidd)
Niggas be schemin, fiendin
They cut your jooks, they off the hook, I come through there look how they look
I'm ridin leanin, they dreamin they do me dirty
If they could I'm lookin like I wish you would
(Try me, go 'head, try me) Niggas be schemin, dreamin
(Try me have you hooked to I-V) Niggas be schemin, dreamin

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
It sounds like a nightmare, I graduated from fightin
Play the projects faster than the third of two man indictments
See my baby blue Ferrari make 'em feel like the virus
In they stomach, I keep it one hundred I make 'em vomit
I got a code name for straps, the sacks in the trumpet
I get the blowin, ya ears will ring for days when I dump it
My bullet wounds call them beauty marks and my hole we don't talk to narcs
So the first forty eight the clock tickin the plot thickens
The charge cocaine possession I'm creepin with a firearm
The D's don't even wanna see me, with a firearm
Before I go back again I'm a let it off
They ain't got to pop first, fuck that I'm a set it off
I need a mental eval, something's wrong with my brainwaves
I'm rich as a motherfucker still ridin with a AK 
Picture me comin through lettin a nigga play me
When I got all this bread, bitch it's off with ya head...asap!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Kidd Kidd)
Niggas be schemin, fiendin
They cut your jooks, they off the hook, I come through there look how they look
I'm ridin leanin, they dreamin they do me dirty
If they could I'm lookin like I wish you would
(Try me, go 'head, try me) Niggas be schemin, dreamin
(Try me have you hooked to I-V) Niggas be schemin, dreamin  

[Verse Three: Kidd Kidd]
I had to be slippin to let this clown hit me up
Now I got to walk around with this shit bag for months
Now I don't give a fuck 'bout a bitch or a nigga
Startin to treat my own brothers like they just another nigga
My click got smaller and my clips got bigger
Condom on my heart, motherfuck your feelings
They call me Superman see I ain't 'posed to walk
Better watch how you talk or get popped like a cork, off

[Verse Four: 50 Cent]
See they ain't real as they seem and they schemin
They fiendin and dreamin, they geekin and creepin
They hear tires screechin, infrared beamin
Niggaz head leakin, what the fuck was he thinkin?
Sounds of police, momma signin new leases
You know you got to relocate her when you beefin
I guess you're here for a real reason
Rah got hit like he got hit but he ain't fuckin breathin, uhh!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Kidd Kidd)
Niggas be schemin, fiendin
They cut your jooks, they off the hook, I come through there look how they look
I'm ridin leanin, they dreamin they do me dirty
If they could I'm lookin like I wish you would
(Try me, go 'head, try me) Niggas be schemin, dreamin
(Try me have you hooked to I-V) Niggas be schemin, dreamin

[Verse One: Paris]
I, string 'em along on some acoustic guitar shit
Tell 'em park it, front of Neiman Marcus
(Badly Neishka)  I need that, I need that
(Armando Castilo) I need that, I need that
Said we gon' chill, where the weed that? The weed at?
Said you got a Spider, where them keys at? Them keys at?
Lit it on 'em, shitted on 'em, torture
I'm hotter than a sauna, pull up in a Zonda
Calm yourself 'fore you get dealt with
Have the medics workin on your pelvis
T.O.A., there's nothin left to say
Went down like a hourglass; Paris first class
Regardless, fake bitches not responsive
Me I'm in the streets rockin a piece that's retarded
In the diamond district with Jacob
Makin all you little clones wanna save up

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
We come from Queens where we are taught to handle beef on our own (OH!)

Where Brooklyn at?! Where The Bronx at?! Where Harlem at?! Where Yonkers at?! (OH!)

[Verse Two: Paris]
All my men is caked up, stingy with the snatch
'Cause niggas get too attached, sleep with the rat-chet 
Under the mattress, natural
My cat got a got a five o'clock shadow, it don't matter
'Cause niggas is still badder your chicks is gettin fucked
I'm on top, that's how I rock luxury every stop
Eat it or beat it you should already know
My friend you're not needed, next nigga RE-MIX!!!
Word to ev'rything, on some g shit
Fuck with me, give me a reason

Heh! Your now rockin with the best mama
Bombshell hood hottie unit A shell Bugati OH!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

[Verse Three: 50 Cent]
Queens will ease on 'em, squeeze on 'em
We'll dump the two two three's on 'em
Breeze on 'em lit the trees on 'em
And the bandana make 'em think it's gang related
We on that gritty shit the city shit, New York, New York
You come through on some pretty shit get outlined and chalked
I get busy I get busy I'm strapped now
I'm tryin to say I want you motherfuckers to act out
I'll have that ass sprint towards the door when I back out
Don't do it don't you do it, dow-dow-down make me stick to you
Holey moley the roley icey always perpetual
Diamonds blinkin like hazards take a look at it
I'm a regular badman they say I'm a madman
Fuck a mask and gloves, I let it off bare hand
We come from a warzone them Southside streets
Where anything and everything get done to eat  

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
We come from Queens where we are taught to handle beef on our own (OH!)
You call the cops we get it poppin we be out with the chrome (OH!)
Where Brooklyn at?! Where The Bronx at?! Where Harlem at?! Where Staten at?! (OH!)
Where Brooklyn at?! Where The Bronx at?! Where Harlem at?! Where Yonkers at?! (OH!)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I don't wanna love....you

[Verse Three: 50 Cent]
I don't want a relationship I just want to have fun
In every position we can't come up until were done
At my request is to kick that shit in my ear
Like to hear what your thinkin after laughin and drinkin
Though we can have a ball, yeah we can do it all
Moon shine, light up the sky at nighttime 
With me, any time could be the right time
I'm sort of impulsive, I'm kind of explosive
Me, just take a little at a time in doses
Don't want you addicted, I just wanna kick it
You could pick the spot I'll be there with the greatness
Give it to you good when I'm gone I'm sure you 'gon miss this

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I don't wanna love....you
I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out

Nothing is quite as it seems
Fuck with me and you will see

[Interlude]
Shoot your gun I'll make you a believerrrrr
Now you better pray for something morrrrre

[50 Cent]
I go to war to my house, stuntin niggaz ain't listenin
Get to thumpin and to dumpin at your newborn's christenin
Tell your homie tell his homies he gon' need more homies
Ain't this a bitch, I got that extended clip right on me
And my diamonds on my neck, I dare a nigga to scheme on it
That Ruger on deck, it's hard to miss with the beam on it
I'll give ya ass a permanent nap, sing you a lullaby
I got money to run, so fuck a alibi

[Interlude]

[50 Cent]
Yeah, I believe you when you say you tough nigga
All that means is you fucked nigga
I get the drop I'm on it
Morning noon and night, I spot ya, I got ya
Wake up cuffed to your bed, cops askin who shot ya
As the world turns, {?} we learned that hollow tips burn and I ain't concerned
If I ain't hit then I ain't hit so a nigga don't really give a shit
You know who you're fuckin with, come through dump more than a clip
Niggaz be on some stupid shit, 'til you get hit, ain't that a bitch?

[Kidd Kidd]
Uhh, K-I-double, shotgun barrel double
My homies run a couple and I move 'em on the double
Racks in the duffle, mac with the muzzle
Make me circle you in all black like a tunnel
I only know how to hustle, can't stay out of trouble
I got a big gun, motherfuck a scuffle
"Kidd Kidd, will you ever change?" Fuck no~!
Pimp zone, rider gang, you already fuckin know

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Kidd Kidd]
Man, these niggaz so fake I call 'em knock offs

You ain't hot dog, you the fuckin Mickie Mouse soft
I'm on fire like Louisiana hot sauce
Brand new J's cost a buck-fifty nigga
You scuff these I'll skull your face buck-fifty nigga
Been fuckin with them pigs, you a guinea nigga
And you always big and you a skinny nigga
I wear my gun like it's trendy nigga
You pussy and ain't shit, kitty litter
Uh, see where all that bitchin get ya?

Uhh, all I do is this
Stunt when I want, and rock newer shit

I'm super rich like Russell, naw Lyor

She's spoiled, she want it she can have that
Your bitch cool, but where her Birkin bag at?
You could tell a lot about a nigga by his bitch
Be my guest, look at mine, I'm the shit
I'm hot, my shit bump coast to coast, don't it?
I get bread, my watch I blew a loaf on it
Get caught starin at that get smoked for it
Fool, my swag unlimited
So fly ain't shit I can't buy
Louboutin kicks; my Louboutin bitch
Fresh off the runway, get you one one day
Catch me in Milan, tuxedo on
The Black James Bond, nigga I'm a don
I do what I want, when and where I want

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Put yo' hands up (put 'em up)
High where my eyes could see (what's up)
You know you wanna party with me (let's fuck)
We whylin in the place to be - bitch quit playin
Put yo' hands up (put 'em up)
High where my eyes could see (what's up)
You know you wanna party with me (let's fuck)
We whylin in the place to be - nigga quit playin

[50 Cent]
Catch me ridin solo, Purple Label polo
Paparazz' photo, my side bitch in Manolo
It's all about dough though, my knuckle game like Cotto
Plus I get to shootin but keep that on the low though
Ay~! Nigga I ain't really got to talk about it
Me I get paper, moves I make major
Shoes I rock gator, wing tips playa
My style so pure, I'm so couture
I'm down by law, certified B-boy
Hold up, wait a minute - money I'm gon' spend it
Or why the fuck would I hustle hard to get it?
So many flows the hoes be on the diddick
And when they pop it and lock it they know I'm wit it
"Dame lingua," give me tongue while I hit it
She a star, fresh from P.R.
Give me more, baby give me more

[Chorus]

[Intro: 50 Cent - singing]
If you think you're lonely now
Wait until tonight, girl (ahh man)
If you think you're lonely now (it's goin down tonight baby)
Wait until tonight

[50 Cent]
I'm waitin on you to cum/come baby I'm that man
Bedroom superhero, naked I'm Batman
I kill it then I'll give ya mouth-to-mouth CPR
Bring ya back to life - climax, start your afterlife
Bounce up and down on my love, this is chronic
Have it how ya want it, my backshot's bionic
She +Givin Me Somethin I Could Feel+ like En Vogue
Unload then reload, recharge, I'm back hard
Get back at it, fuckin up the springs in her Craftmatic
Jackrabbit addiction, I don't wanna break that habit
Your boy toy, man-child, it's cool you could play with me
City life, bright lights, tonight you could stay with me
I wan' share thoughts, let's talk, go for a walk (woo!)
Fantasies, we can get loose right in the park (woo!)
Bull's-eye right through her head to her heart
It's mental and physical; when you're gone I'll be missin you

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You gon' get it, you gon' get it, I got a plan for you (I got it all planned out girl)
Girl it's on 'til the morn' when you come through (ha ha!)
I can't think of a thing now that I won't do (what you wan' do?)
When you come and I get, my hands on you (wait 'til I get you girl)

[50 Cent]
I'm Curtis Mayfield, Marvin, the new Bobby Womack
2012 freak shit, baby I'm all that
The touchin and the teasin, the pleasure's the reason
I'm sure she'll be open from the lickin and strokin
Or how I say a line that stimulates her mind
My sense of humor make her smile while passin time
It's sexual, it's not perverted or obscene
The foreplay we play until I touch her and she cream
Cash rules the shorty, she's somethin out a dream
Half J-Lo, half Jessica Biel, she in between
Got the island girl swag, she dutty wine
But when we get back to the spot, that ass is mine
See how I switch gears? Her bra gone, it's on
It's showtime, yeah it's my turn to perform
Leave the lights on, while I get it I got it good
She's sayin she love my show and I'm thinkin I knew she would

[Chorus]

"So tonight, I wanna talk to you about the relationship
 between money and peace.
 A lot of other people say it's not about money.
 It's about peace, and it's about joy, and it's about love.
 It's about money, it's about money, it's about money."

[50 Cent along with sample]
You took my heart... right outta me
And tore it... in a million pieces

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You took my heart, from me
I'll never be, the same
Now killin won't be hard, for me
Cause I can't, feel, a thang

[50 - over Chorus]
Man I don't give a fuck, I don't wanna hear nothin
Y'all niggaz, man
What? What the fuck is you lookin at?
Oh you tough? Oh, oh he a tough nigga
Go get my straps man, get the straps

[50 Cent]
Sunday morning, preacher in the pulpit
Kiss my nana, I can't listen to this bullshit
It's all good 'til he askin for an offerin
All we got is pain, so that's all I could offer him
My momma cold, she brought me in this cold world
And left me - what I got to protect me?
Oh I got a nine, yeah I got a nine
And all this ambition, bitch I'm on the grind
Sky's the limit; two for five's the gimmick
You line some'n up, I'll tie some'n up
Then run up out that crib with that money nigga what
School of hard knocks, I'm ahead of my class
With no hesitation put a hole in yo' ass
You know it's never my fault when I fuck up
I knock ya ass out, then wake you the fuck up
Brass knuckles and my knife, now tell me what's up
Would ya now

[Chorus]

[50 - over Chorus]
Son you know I don't like these sucka ass niggaz anyway
I'm tellin you these niggaz think you soft son
You see, you see what I'm tellin you
They think you sweet son
Fuck it, give me the strap son!

[50 Cent]
I made it to a half a mansion, I thought I made it
Hood bitches on a nigga yeah, all on a nigga yeah
The D's hit the door with the batter ram, rushin in
I'm standin by the toilet that's broke, tryin to flush the shit
Bizzy was my nigga, started fuckin with that cracker shit
Beat me out my money, nigga ran off with my Mac kid
Damn, I was down, he kicked me when I'm down
When I think about the shit it fucked my head up right now
You know the same niggaz that got me shot killed your brother
And you ain't never did shit about that muh'fucker
Them niggaz that's beefin wit'chu, I shot that park up
Now I'm thinkin 'bout the occasions my gun blazin
You got me feelin like a sucker B

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Son I don't give a fuck, son we can go back right now!
Niggaz gon' try to front on me and be right there?
Nah, nah, I'm puttin them niggaz on house arrest
I'ma go then I'ma go back, fuck that
I'ma stay on them niggaz 'til they can feel me breathin on 'em
You-you look at these fake ass niggaz
They think cause they say some fake shit in music
That the shit I be sayin ain't real
All you gotta do is ask niggaz, they'll tell you about me
They don't say 50 though, they say Boo-Boo
Uh-huh, find out, find out if I'll let it go
Man turn this shit off!

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Sprinkle a litle 2Pac on it
{2Pac: "It ain't easy bein me"}
I'm legendary, I'm necessary
They call me Ferrari, they call me 50
Call me Big Homie, hah

[50 Cent]
I got a bad bitch over the crib, I'm finna pop her off
Nigga call me in thirty, I'll beat and dropped her off
It's a quickie, the ass and the lips are super soft
And to top it off, she topped me off
Niggaz try to front on my swag, knock it off
Put the strap to the back of ya knot and knock it off
Homicide'll have to come through, block it off
That's what they do after that chopper get to choppin off
They say a nigga off, they think a nigga off
I'm on the runway, one way, takin off
I tell a chick, "Pay a pimp, bitch, break it off"
I smack a hoe, "That ain't shit, bitch, shake it off"

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Off and on; these niggaz be off and on
And it go {"on and on, on"}
And, it go {"on and on, on"}
Off and on; me? I'm never off, I'm on
And it go {"on and on, on"}
And, it go {"on and on, on"}
{2Pac: "It ain't easy bein me"}

[50 Cent]
Go 'head, ask about 50 Ferrari, I never take a loss
I'm a boss, tell niggaz to let it off, set it off
Diamond cloth, plush loft, niggaz floss at all costs
God damnit it all costs, get it now, half off
Diamond stud show-off, niggaz swag be so off
They stunt 'til I go off, the six hour blow-off
Hawaii mahi-mahi teriyaki, I'm so cocky
Who the fuck out here to stop me? Make a hater sit and watch me
And it seem like it is but it's not the same, man niggaz ain't got what I got my mayne
Got a flow so pure like brick cocaine, make a bitch wanna be my secret mayne
Freaky and you eat that thang, every now and then I beat that mayne
She tell a nigga not to say a thang, I can't keep a secret mayne

[Chorus]

{2Pac: "It ain't easy bein me"}

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Got the shotgun, got the handgun
Got the paper in my Nike box
Burn the haze up, better raise up
'Fore you get your punk ass shot

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
We hunt 'em down, and gun 'em down
Cut 'em down to the floor - nah nah nah
You fuck around, the tre-pound
That's six rounds for the raw - nah nah nah
We on the trip, fuck up a flip
Hundred grams of the raw - nah nah nah
We on the shit, we spit a clip
At your whip homeboy - nah nah nah

[50 Cent]
Yeah I run the town like a marathon, track star, trap star
Teflon shock plate, front and back, uhh
P-90 Ruger talk, 38-special flow
Hollow-tip, Prada shit, flyest nigga in New York
C-4 in the function, the bomb niggaz frontin
I got it like they want it so they hatin when I'm stuntin
I'm hot now, I'm bigger than the block now
Rolls drop top down, Lambo top down
Violate get shot down, I live by the codes you follow
I jux somethin nigga 'fore I beg or borrow
I come from the street where there's strong and there's weak
And when the strong hungry the weak's somethin to eat

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]
Yeah, this rap shit is fake if you really wanna ask me
I'm in the projects with a bitch like Cassie
Drop top Maybach, the roof all glassy
Level two vest on cause niggaz wanna blast me
I'm a menace to society, that's what the judge said
My kind of money leave the D.A. and the judge dead
Shorty turned 5 and he rep that 5
Shorty just turned 6 and he rep that 6
I got my crack and my fo'-fo' 'til fo' in the morning
Gas up the truck, fuck, global warming
My money be foreign, my cars be foreign
It's pedal to the medal in them Air Force Jordans

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]
Yeah, fo' bitches in the European whip +Set it Off+ like Cleo
Haitian bitches talkin Creole
Rappers feindin to ball, triple-header, Christmas day
Navy blue Phantom Ghost, box for the pistol play
Why Comrade Mary overdose on M.J.?
Why Big ain't have a bullet-proof truck like me?
Why the club shot up? What the fuck you expect?
They don't search niggaz buyin bottles at Juliet
Yeah I just left Southside, I'm Teterboro{?} Westside
Money team live the dream, haters tryin to strategize
We work hard, this ain't come easy
Bitch slob me in the coupe, yeah I cum easy

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah~! I am N.Y., no lie
Yeah~! I am N.Y., no lie

[50 Cent]
They say they do it like I do it with no mask on
Nigga get the fuck outta line you're gettin blast on
Jesus let the weak roam the Earth without a purpose
But I'll stomp your fuckin head 'til it's under the surface
Now I need you to get it through your bloodclat head
Before I put a bullet through your bloodclat dreads
These niggaz ain't made of the same shit I'm made of
I dump a clip for my man if he need a favor
I let a nigga slide, he came back and almost shot me
Then he was thinkin I was scared, naw nigga not me
They don't understand I was raised by the vultures
Killed laughin like hyenas in the crib full of roaches
Called grandmomma Mommy cause mommy already dead
And daddy been missin since I was a little kid
Now who dare goes there playin games with the orphan
They know my pedigree, test me, I'ma off 'em

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]
Stop the bloodclat cryin
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lyin
Don't cry, dry, your eye
Don't cry, dry, your eye

[50 Cent]
That first body drop, we just gettin started
Death come in threes; AR-15, M-16
Semi-automatic, murder machine
Wave that, blaze that, give a nigga wings
When that blade in your flesh it's an emergency
Your love leak, heart open, call the surgery
Feels like my last girlfriend, I lost her
On second thought I know just where I left her, the altar
See I have an advantage, I don't care about tomorrow
Find out that I ain't frontin when them casings start to fall
You know attempted murder was the case that they gave me
Nine bullet wounds now a nigga half crazy
What is that, a tear I see formin in your eye?
Why are you so frightened? We're all gonna die
You could say a prayer when I'm comin like the Reaper
Starin through that sight on the top of my heater
{*click-clack*} Now

[Chorus]

The murders have made it
impossible for them to dissolve the secret society
which leaves them only one course of action
To protect, defend, and expand
The bigger they get, the less vulnerable they become...
Be careful, they will do everything they can to manipulate you
Only if and when they can't, will they kill you

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
I'm insane, yeah, shit changed
I'm ahead of that BANG! BANG! Guerilla ryder gang!
Make it rain, trick, make it rain
I hold onto mind and buy more cocaine
I'm! Off the chain, nigga I ain't playin
I get in with the semi nigga stunt I make it rain
He rap, I rap but we ain't the same
He love her dame, I run a train
Canary yellow rocks in my rings
Everything private my hoes in my planes
Hurry now bartender more champagne 
I shine like chrome interiors on a Range
I stunt when I want I ain't never 'gon change
That gold lookin good in my Cartier frames
This what happen when the Bebe kids
Blow up I'm on out this bitch

Throwin cake on your wifey she lickin the icin
And a, it's not even my birthday

And plus yo' ass ain't 'posed to be here in the first place
Nowadays they holla Kidd let he hold sum'n

Ryder gang thang play the bitch then watch us ball

Tell the waitress bring the bottles with the top sparklin

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Sample from "Pee Wee Dance" by Joe Ski Luv)

[50 Cent]
Yeah
It is what it is son, niggaz can't stand it
It's my fifth lap, a nigga been 'round and 'round the planet
Shawty sayin "Welcome to Miami"
Her friends sayin "Welcome to Miami"
Jet skis, the yacht, parked in the back yard
Back to back Porsches, a nigga go that hard
I love money, nigga this drug money
Laundromat spin cycle, make it snow money
Beef nothin to a nigga, nigga I'm comfy
Throw a hundred racks on a bitch, I told ya she want me
If I want the hoe I get the hoe, fuck the hoe then forget the hoe
Let a hoe be a hoe, pay a pimp, pay the rent
I'm a fly nigga on or off, yeah I buy fly shit
Presidential Roley, nigga tell me, now can you buy that?
I'm the biggest nigga Southside seen since Fat Cat
I tell a nigga suck a dick quick cause I'm strapped jack

I make it double up, pure blocks of raw
I, I, I did it, I got to get more
I make it double up, baking soda galore
'Til we in Bentleys and mansions with marble on the floor
I make it double up
Ay bring me that Pyrex
Get the baking soda, the ice
I'ma show you how to do this shit
You think I don't know what I'm doin but I know what I'm doin

[Hayes]
We on the other side of the border chillin with drug lords
Tryin to put a order in during the drug wars
Jay said this what happen when you disrespect one of us
And cut a motherfucker head off right in front of us
That's when I said I'm goin back to Cali
My man said he goin back to Cali
I know some Mexicans in Arizona I'm cool with
I'd rather slang that than come and deal with this bullshit
... Cause I ain't gon' budge
Pay me or die G, dawg it ain't no love
Niggaz know who they owe, my number ain't change bitch
Front door service, put one in your brain quick
Could've put it right in your chest, close range shit
Watch you die slow, let you know who you playin with
Fuck all that swearin to God, promise and prayin shit
I ain't a big sob story fan, I'm sprayin shit
12-gauge, AR-15, AK'n shit
Passanger seats gon' get killed, I'm sayin this
Princi-pals, we don't draw the line at drug dealin
We crimi-nals goin all out
Before I say you played me I'll go in y'all house
And get killed there or blow your fuckin brains out
You gotta bring ya ass to get some
You gotta make cash to spend some
And I ain't a victim muh'fucker - Hayes

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Hey what's up man? It's the kid 50 Cent man

[Eminem]

Murder dem, murder dem
They violate I demonstrate, yeah I'll murder dem
Niggaz be frontin, word up, they stuntin 'til they hurt up
Their semi talk, I'll let it buck, I'll have these niggaz runnin hard
I'll pull a nigga's skirt up then have him kickin dirt up
I'll get a nigga, hit a nigga back up stupid hard
Silence, it's the return of the tyrant
See him through my third eye with both closed eyelids
Stand closer to the homie you wan' die with
Flames come up out the muzzle on the shit that I spit
Get murked! I'm talkin like the Feds ain't listenin
Nigga this a pool of piranhas you fishin in
I'll give it to a nigga if he want it
Better ask niggaz 'bout me, I'll be on it
I get the drop, blow at your knot, perfect plannin
Hit your back with somethin hot, out the cannon

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]
It's murder one (one)
It's premeditated - murder
Then it's another one (one)
Back to back put work in

[50 Cent]
You know I ain't got the strap on me
Bar holdin that for me
I'm fucked up, it really doesn't matter though
100 9-millimeter shells in the Calico
Wait, niggaz drop like dominoes
Run for your life puta, s??, v?monos
I was taught to treat my crew a long time ago
Grew up around cocaine, yeah, even my momma know
I cut a O in the fo' with seven at a time
Make 400 off that, you know a nigga grind
Like Cyndi Lauper bitch, +Time After Time+
A nigga shine, like a nickel-9
I been talkin to the man in the mirror
Niggaz so ass they be shakin like Shakira
It seems like my vision's gettin clearer
See me comin with the hammer out, death is gettin near ya
It's funny how niggaz never hear ya
'til ya run down on 'em; gun down on 'em

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, startin to feel like the old me!
Ha ha

[Intro: 50 Cent]

Hear my voice, you know it's 50

[2 Chainz]
Damn right I got it, damn right I got it

[Verse One: 2 Chainz]
I said lame niggaz be quiet, lame niggaz be quiet, lame niggaz be quiet
You in the presence of a real nigga
I said lame niggaz be quiet, lame niggaz be quiet, lame niggaz be quiet
You in the real nigga presence
I eat your girl up for breakfast, won't save you no extra
Say she fuckin with me cause a real nigga's her preference
Drink like I'm from Texas, and you know I stay flexin
And if you don't know I go by Tity 2 Necklace

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Nigga that's cocaine that I'm flippin (YEAH!)
Wood-Wood grain when I'm pimpin (GRRRR!!!!)
C-C-Codeine when I'm sippin bitch you fuckin right I be trippin (WOOOO!!!)

Count-Count my paper all of them stacks fuck-fuck some up then get it right back
NIG-NIGGA TRY ME!!!!!!

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I'ma start a riot, I'ma start a riot {*4X*}

[Verse Three: 2 Chainz]
Ain't stuntin these niggaz, ain't stuntin these bitches
Two cigarillos, look like extensions
Yeah I'm from the Southside, her mouth wide, my pack loud
My gat loud I back out, and click clack, pow pow
Court dates, skip trial, my rep is a reptile
An hour later, alligators, I stepped on the work like a stepchild
Pimps up, hoes down, make your girl pull her clothes down
Her hair down and I'm down, her phone off so don't dial

[Verse Four: 50 Cent]
That-That pyrex in my kitchen (Kitchen) Rich nigga still pitchin (Pitchin)
Them GD's and them Vice Lords love that gangsta shit that I be kickin (Kickin)
Who Blood now who Crippin?! (Crippin) Who pussy tell me who snitchin (Snitchin)
I got a firearm the fire on whoever done let that bitch in (Bitch in)
These-These niggas don't live by the codes, look how they done fucked up the game
Throw your sets up, if you don't give a fuck, It's 50 and 2 Chainz
Got the hood back poppin now thanks to this, I buy the whole bar nigga you can drank to this
Get the bottles poppin while the hoes watchin man damn I love this gangsta shit
Gang-Gangsta shit! 

[Chorus: 2 Chainz

[Outro: 50 Cent]
We 'gon get back to the real shit!

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Put on my O.J. gloves and watch me kill this shit
Beat the case then come home then go back from doin some different shit
I'm pullin off a O.J., a, a O.J.

[Kidd Kidd]
I'm smokin up my lungs, this liquor drownin my liver
I'm as usin these prescriptions, these pancakes now full of syrup
Mayweather all contenders, I eat each rappers for dinner
Put these rattin ass niggaz in the sewer, Master Splinter
Sound like my phone is bugged, give a nigga the jitters
But, I don't give a fuck, tell the pigs to kiss my shitter
Yeah I'm kind of thinner but Goddamn yo' jeans are slimmer
I don't want you 'round my children, you look like a sex offender
+Planet of the Apes+, I'm a G-Unit Gorilla
All these rappers claim they killers, probably sue you when you hit 'em
See, I'm not what you used to, I ain't Soo-Woo, I ain't Crip'in
I'm a Rida Gang nigga, we gon' get in where we fit in
Huh~!

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]
Put on my O.J. gloves then watch me kill this shit
Beat the case then come home then go back from doin some different shit
I'm pullin off a O.J., a, a O.J.
I'm pullin off a O.J., I'm killin these bitches!

[50 Cent]
Got a new bitch that's so bad, yeah she don't know what she doing
And her ass so round and fat, when she touch me I'm like BOING!
I want head and I want tails, so I don't wanna flip a coin
I don't kiss and I don't tell, so her close friend she can join
L called me from the pens, askin me how things are going
Said the money is still flowing, yeah the Rida Gang is still blowing
And my neck and my wrists and my ears and my fists got diamonds all over, shit glowing
And the Lambo ain't got no top; it ain't summer yet but it's hot
You gon' lose your speech when you hit the streets and you see the bitches I got
You better believe it's real, from the Philippines to Brazil
Lil' Mexican chica, I want you to meet her, people can give it to you pure
100% uncut; now nigga you know, what's up

[Chorus]

[Kidd Kidd]
Huh~! MJG, bitch I got them +8 Balls+
Four-door garage? Bitch I need eight cars!
They want me +Locked Up+, they singing like Akon
Her shot up, like I dove head on
Bitch my life right, and you niggaz dead wrong
I will take yo' head off so you can see me head on
I'm gettin my head blown, you know what her head on
She got my head gone, shit I'm 'bout to head home
Pimp zone, that's my destination
Still street, never handed in my resignation
Ding-Dong, I'm at your doorbell waitin
Who tryna get served? I'm 'bout to do some caterin
Huh~!

[Chorus]

[Intro: Robbie Nova]
Uh! Oh yeah! I just wanna! Still love you girl
And I'm not 'gon lie girl, I just wanna, I just wanna
Oh girl! 

[Chorus: Robbie Nova]
I could take you to dinner girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Go to the movie girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl
See I could take you shoppin girl but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Or I could feel you head up girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
Nigga really wanna get to know you girl, see many things I wanna show you girl
See anything I guess I owe you girl, Louboutin's, movin on
'Fore the sun comes up then the top comes down, find out what the white Rolls Royce about
Run the white Air's on extra clear, like James Brown a nigga do it like a +Sex Machine+
I got a hot, wheel, fetish, I pull up in some mean shit
Sex, drugs, rock and roll, Charlie Sheen bitch!
See me +Toot It And Boot It+ on my Obama shit
Money ain't no tellin how much I'm a get
I spit bars have the hood in a frenzy
Fuck around take a chain like Lindsay
Paparazzi takin pictures of my Fendi
Catch me in Prada, or maybe Asata
Just another beautiful day in .L.A.
And I'm a New Yorker professional shit talker HUH!!! 
I see niggas is stressin
And I'm straight so I'm guessin, I'm above the recession 

[Chorus: Robbie Nova]
I could take you to dinner girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Go to the movie girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl
See I could take you shoppin girl but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Or I could feel you head up girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
It takes just a little bit of my conversation when I talk
To make you clear fo' sho' that I'm that nigga in New York
Shorty now lay down, put your head back
I put your legs backstroke and move your bed back
When we get to them back shots, shorty throw it back
When you back it up, that mean, I like that
Let me guess I turn you on, I turn you on I bet
We just gettin started and everything soakin wet
This pussy good she ain't worried about the rent this month
This pussy must have went and bought this bitch that Benz out front
For me it's nothin I'm just fuckin for the fuck of it
But shorty actin like what we just did some other shit
It can't be, it could be ok maybe she's a good girl
Attracted to me and things from my world
Temptations are great
One ten is bracelets that worth eight carats are ten times eight

[Chorus: Robbie Nova]
I could take you to dinner girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Go to the movie girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl
See I could take you shoppin girl but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Or I could feel you head up girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Why should I waste my time lyin? The fuck would I be doin
Look let me tell you somethin right
If the bitch 'gon roll, or bitch 'gon get the joggin or walkin
Or however you know she wanna, you know exit
Bitch get! You know what I'm sayin and....
If a bitch came in, on BB's she 'gon leave on BB's I don't give a fuck
Get her that Chris Louboutins, Alexander McQueen, DaVinci
We could put you on all that fly shit, bitch the shit stayin in the closet
I'm a meet another bitch wear a size seven and a half
Fuck with me see if I'm bullshittin!

[Intro]
Yeah! You see a nigga soft, my first instinct is to lean on him
A weak nigga eatin in my hood niggas say put a beam on him
These niggas ain't supposed to be eatin yo, they sweet as Sweet'N Low
I'll have him like shit was all good just a week ago

[Verse One]
This is Fif niggas get you in the mood for love
I'm back to get you in the mood for the snub and gloves
Dope fiend, morphone, cocaine dilemma
Crack come to cook it up back boy I'm a chemist
Fuck pill poppin that strap I pop that
Watch the Henchmen trial see a rat, rat on a rat
He got a nice gimmick goin you been hot a few summers
But I got that kinda flow that could stop world hunger
SK I got nothin but energy
Call me 50 call me Ferrari the remedy
Hi again incase a hater don't remember me
I happen to be what these rap niggas they pretend to be
Hittin you won't be enough you gotta finish me
Or it's rueger time, the S-R nine
Frank missed ricochet and your ass go blind
Time's up your fucked, gotta learn to duck, what's up?!

[Chorus]
Don't make me! Don't make me! Don't make me!  
Seem so complicated
Don't make me! Don't make me! Don't make me!  
Show you what's up, don't make me fuck you up
    
[Verse Two]
Listen every bitch on the milk box ain't missin
I mean some of these hoes runnin 'round with pimpin
I'm writin reality it sounds harsh, Shyne tried to get at me he sounds washed
I ain't even fired back the shit's squashed
What kind of shit is that this only happens in rap
These niggas so fake it make my skin crawl
Hope I ain't the last real nigga up over the wall
Ice touchin the chain, waves spinnin, cream linen
Poses from the benjamins in 'em
Time forward, oh lord
If I ain't no better I think a nigga pushed raw
It feels like it's never gonna stop
A nigga so hot, i may spend forever on top
Forever ever, forever in a drop
Can't tell I got it on lock? BITCH!!!!!

[Chorus]
Don't make me! Don't make me! Don't make me!  
Seem so complicated
Don't make me! Don't make me! Don't make me!  
Show you what's up, don't make me fuck you up

[Verse 1]
I put the shit together, I tear the shit apart
Demolition the upper deck, I let you see the spark
Cut open your head, make your brain a landmark
Put what you're thinking on a curve, nigga, mock my word
Does the alley take it's turn be your loss
Double barrel rock's player has guitar off
You don't want it hard, nigga, I'll just go on you harder
Dog, you're stick, you're ripped, your hip stand decripped
You raise your leisure, pardon miss with the laser
You talk shit, I spit the razor
The master mind is a must, why you know how to touch it
I plug it, planned it and execute it, dammit

[Hook]
You're a killer, you damn nigga, you've been working all the time
You will shoot this night too with your maneuver, with the nine
I heard it all before, I'm straight coming at you, bro
This won't be a war, I get the gun, blow your face on the floor
I'll get you with the secret talk, nigga, all that makes you fall, nigga
Nigga I'll get the drop, yeah

Nigga, make one false move around me, I'll say fuck it, I'm riding
And they've no sense of try to dug me and motherfucker I'll found him

[Verse 2]
I still go to my 50's niggas everywhere I go I face
Catch me sleeping no days, you pussy niggas no way
To stop me you will need at least a mack boy
Shoot me with a 2-5 and I'll be like "what you do that for? "
The party poppin' ain't gonna cut it
But once you cross the line, you cross the line, nigga, so fuck it
I'm build for, try to do the shit I do get killed for
Lots of blood spilt for a thief I'm still known for
Niggas wanna bump with Ferrari, probably they ain't get the memo
I got cake to show weight
My gun and money make the nigga put a mask on
Shoot a head or break a leg, put a cast on

[Hook]

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
Try to remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Pocket full of green, green in the bong
That bitch with the bowlegged stance turnin me on
Two mill time these rainbows to be on
Niggas still want me dead like Osam
But they ain't 'gon make it they come at me wrong
Them niggas all workers who smack the shit out they bosses
Ferrari I'm stronger than five hundred horses
Money is power you niggas better wake up
My earrings blinkin that's old shit from Jacob
Add it up four plus four that's eight karats
You can't run and get your bid you ain't got it
Blackjack, we do that ten grand a hand
You could get shot fuckin with Floyd that's my man
Billionaire brotherhood we call this the money team
Pinky ring flawless my god I'm gorgeous

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, hoe, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, don't, ring the alarm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, nigga, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, this a al quaeda bomb

[Verse Two: Snoop Dogg]
I'm chillin like a villian while I'm dealin I am
Rulin while I'm coolin with the tool in my hand
Post up, coast up, this is my life bitch
Up close homey you get stuck with a knife bitch
Cuz burnt out, turnt out like a light switch
Got alot of hoes, but Charmaine that's my white bitch
The rest of my bitches nah they ain't gonna like this
But I don't give a fuck 'cause they all love this night stick
But I still remain calm, bang and drop bombs
Collar popped up, cool as The Fonze
Motherfucker! Have a seat and loosen up
Get a glass of some gin, now juice it up, deuces up
See it's a line there for a reason
And if you cross it, no more breathin, ya leavin
Believe it, we understand each other?
'Cause I would hate to have to put a slug in ya brotha, ya dig?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, hoe, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, don't, ring the alarm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, nigga, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, this a al quaeda bomb

[Verse Three: Precious Paris]
When Fif on that shit, that glock, cocks in your face
My twat, cocks in your face, you know you want taste
Alexander McQueen strapless with my back out
Six inch Davinci's a bitch fittin to act out
Niggas on my heels tryin to find out what that head like
I know what that bread like my bucky yard head like
Shine like I shine, night or daytime
My na, na na na na, make a nigga want buy everything I say buy
My na na na na, get wet I got that come back that crack
My assets, is my ass jack
Stunt I tell my niggas right, where your stash at
You fuckin with a Southside bitch, I go where the money go
I'm mad damn I put her on the stroll, get my money hoe
Catch me at Farrow Gahmer or Dolce & Gabbana
Or my Trigaliano I'm p squared up, what!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, hoe, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, don't, ring the alarm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, nigga, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, this a al quaeda bomb

[50 Cent]
I had 500 packs, 14 grams of powder
On the phone with my connect, this shit last about a hour
I need work, I repeat, I need work
My niggaz go berserk, when the drought come get murked
When no money comin in is when the guns come out
Why the D's wanna sit in front of my momma house
You know it's sorta like some shit you seen in a flick
Black .9 extended clip, as long as my dick
They say I'm grimy, yeah fuck it I'll line niggaz
I'll show 'em where your shit at before they take mine nigga (ha ha ha)
Don't take it personal, it's just how I grind nigga
Figure, this is a dog-eat-dog world, man
Ebony enemy, today I'm tryin to duck her
Got that Hoover, her head'll make you kill a motherfucker (don't stop girl)
I mean you gotta feel it man
She bob and weave, up and down, you be like "I could just kill a man"
I don't fuck with them niggaz from her projects
They on Section 8, but niggaz cars are straight
They ain't out in the daytime, them niggaz roaches
I don't stop down there if I ain't got the toaster
I'm in the 6-4-5 hard top, not the drop
Leanin, I see them niggaz schemin, dream on
Touch me, shit I wish a nigga would
I'm how my niggaz eat, I'll have 'em light up they whole hood

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
They said I fell off, my Benz was on the repo truck
Around the same time niggaz spots start gettin stuck
Shit, I said "I ain't know nuttin 'bout nuttin"
I'm on the low, niggaz really know me for stuntin
I pull through on low pros, wrapped around deep dishes
That crack money handsome, your bitch blowin me kisses
You need to check her if you think she could be the missus
Damn - I'm startin to think you can't trust nobody
I hold my own strap, they ain't got to hold that for me
I slide by my baby momma crib with the Mac on me
Man since her cousin in the car crash died
She said "Don't drink and drive," I say "Just drink, don't drive"
I had a morphine dream, I got heroin ambitions
That's big money cookin in that coffee pot in the kitchen
When I say I'm straight, I mean I'm straight
Once the razor hit the plate, I double up the cake, ayy

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
You's a purse snatchin ass nigga man
You's a PETTY nigga!
I could look at you I could TELL you's a petty nigga
You's a copy!
You's a itty-bitty nigga, I'm a big city nigga
New York City nigga, ha ha!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Nigga no wake, no pine box, no funeral, just nine shots
Take 'Pac five, plus BIG four, you got 50, I love war
Who waan box? with my ox, who waan dump? I waan dump
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
I think I got 'em, ten shots follow the trail of the blood drops
Fuck the police, better talk to Allah ack

Wake up I'm right there ya hell nound, hell yeah

Move the fuck out the way

Don't wanna play now
I'm on a roll
That's where I plan to stay
Look at the bed you made
And lay down

Nigga better watch what the fuck you say to me
Tricks are for kids don't play with me
You'll get smoked, I ain't for the bullshit
Got the chrome bulldog for that bullshit
Problem nigga, it's ok with me
The revolver always stay with me
You'll get smoked, I ain't for the bullshit
44 bulldog for that bullshit

Nigga that was my mama crack spot

Fuck a fist fight
Shit shift all of sudden, you can box my box cutter as I can see it cutting
Lord have mercy, jesus, lord have mercy
I bet this hurt you like it hurts me (it hurts)
Hot as hell when that gunpowder burning
What goes around don't come around
When I'm putting work in
Nigga swallow your pride and run
You stick around you're done

Body on the ground, it's OK with me

You'll get smoked, I ain't for the bullshit

I got a gun fetish, choppa in the trunk
I shoot a duck flying right out the sky with the punk
A nigga 8 out of 8 of moving targets

You think I'm joking I'm not
Find out when that Glock get to dumping
And your back get hot
I got a temper, you don't wanna test my patience
And end up doc's new patient
Stump your head on the pavement
You try come at me on some brave shit

Move the fuck out the way
This might get rain today
Don't wanna play now
I'm on a roll
That's where I plan to stay
Look at the bed you made

If we going out we going Dutch pay for your dinner bitch
Look bitch, this is my life I'm on some different shit
Every different day I wake up to play with a different bitch
Bitches love me, just like I love me
Fat bitch, skinny bitch, short bitch, tall bitch

In the strip club, let her lick your ass bitch
Get the cash bitch and then go back to your man bitch

Diamonds on my neck, diamonds, diamonds on my neck

They done made me mad, now I'm in my bag
And I'm back with the strap, catch a case, beat a case, rich nigga swag
Every step I take, every little itty-bitty move I make
Turn the big bags of birthday cake, I can't even fit this shit in my SAFE!
W-w-wait! Got more money, come and try not to hate
Why you think a nigga in and out of state? I'm a pro on the low when I operate

Stack on 'em, yeah rack after rack on 'em
Ghetto pharmacist man so I'm cuttin the smack for 'em

I hate when you niggaz do shit then make me ask why
If you the homie why you won't go and testify?
Why you wanna see a nigga get the chair and fry?
I'll grow old in the yard starin at the sky
Why you hurt your friends more than your enemies?
And why you don't sit and stroll through your memories?
Why is the question I ask
Shit was all good when you were splittin up stacks
That shit you told the people got 'em under an axe
Now why, would you wan' do some shit like THAT?
When that barrel on yo' forehead, don't ask why

I don't trick, e'ry now and then I toss her money
Fuck, nut, get up, that's abortion money
I'll kill if I have to, don't force me homie
I get that schoolyard duct tape extortion money
I hate when niggaz act like bitches cause it costs me money
What the fuck!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I'm in London blowin pounds, Japan blowin yen
It's the methodical diabolical nigga with a grin
My stash look like a rainbow, my money is gay
Nowadays I'm just happy things are goin my way
I'm straight, some say I got more than I need
Mucho dinero out in Mexico, they growin my weed
It's amazing, I made it here on my own
I got a frog, a dog with a solid gold bone
An accountant to count, the amount I spent
Wine cellar full of shit, we could all get bent
I got it made, I got Brinks truck money
Euros, grams{?}, you wan' borrow some from me?
My bank statements have you niggaz like "Damn!"
Bitch I got more +francs+ than a hot dog man
Get married, pay for one bitch, I'll buy her bar food
Kids don't try this shit at home, you can't do the shit I do
Whassup?

I put it down when I hit it, she'll be so happy she did it
I bet she'll never forget it, in bed I'm like a wizard
Sorta exquisite, she'll wanna visit over and over and over
Her body's a map, I'm the guide, I'm just here to show her
how I get to that G-spot, non-stop
Tick tock, time fly, hella fun, no lie
Oh I know I can give her what she need
Slow mo' or high speed, ecstacy true indeed

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[50 Cent]
You can hear us from the next room when we go at it
I started her addiction, she got a habit
She gotta have it, I'm always on my job
I work it nice and hard, I mean I work it how she want
She my homie lover friend, yeah she might just bring her other friend
Feel the rush, adrenaline'll make a nigga head spin
I say just keep it simple baby, we ain't got to complicate it
If you want it and I want it maybe we should have it maybe
We got one life to live, it's precious the time we share
Now call me when you're in need, baby girl I'll be there
Fo' sho' in me, you can confide
I'm a rider twenty-fo'/seven, ready to ride - yeah

[Chorus: Brevi] + (50)
You so sweet, come see me

You can be my bitch, you can be my bitch

[50 Cent]
My girl got a girlfriend, I call her her play thang
Why would I complain? She's everything to me mayne
We match together perfect, isn't this amazing?
... Isn't this amazing?
Back massage, menage, get turned on, I'm hard
Great sex, latex, I'm playin my part
Penitration, oral fixation, no camera tapin
We makin the headboard shakin until it's damn near breakin
Now I can tell you from the get-go, so you know how this shit go
This thing I got with my bitch is so ill I mean it's mental
I'm 'bout to break it down on all the freaky shit we into
If you're not into her you're into me and we'll still get you

[Brevi]
Right when we get to the crib (crib, crib)
Step right in (in, in)
Boy you know what this is (is, is)
You could be my bitch, bitch, bitch (hahaha, yeah, bitch)

[Chorus]

Bitch, I'm headin out of state
Got a jet waitin on the runway, baby

But when I get back you know just how it's goin down
We'll be back up in this bitch passin her around

[Brevi]
You don't want me to just play my role
You want me to come take controooool

[Intro: 50 Cent]
It's hot as a motherfucker out here
{"S-M-S, Audio"}

[50 Cent]
Summer heat hot, murder plots, niggaz gettin shot
Chrome rims for 6's, one wheel one Gixxer
Throw it up one hand, wave back at the bitches, I'm silent
Right before I snap, I'm violent
I call myself to tussle, I'm the boss and the muscle
Boy I'll feed yo' ass brass knuckles
A nigga come creepin through the fog, if you're scared get a dog
Get a male cause a bitch'll get you both in the morgue
Now peep the punchlines I'm punchin, these are knockout flows
I'm cyber-pimpin, I'm so new wave I got sci-fi hoes
This is next level mack shit, that's why my money stack quick
Twelve V's, V-12's, half of them triple black bitch
Lust, gluttony, greed, jealousy, envy me
Your pride's blurrin your vision, see I'm where I'm supposed to be
On top of the underground, still gritty, still run the city
Still Em, Dre and Fitty; fuck with me
I'm a usual suspect, when it's a hit
Turn up the volume, you hear my voice, yeah this the shit

[Chorus 2X: sample] {+ ad libs by 50 Cent and ScHoolboy Q*}
"Pardon me please, may I speak to you?"
"I feel this is something, I'm compelled to do"

[ScHoolboy Q]
Pistols and bad bitches, hustlers and bad business
Rappin was just a hobby, that hobby turned to a million
Had that oxy for sale, you can get it 50 a pill
You sniff it or let grill, wrap the foil, you know the drill
Uhh, money power and drugs my only reason to love
Never played cops and robbers, nigga we played Crips and Bloods
Like who the pimp said who the slugs, 2-11 on hookers' purses
Another double-up purchase, slingin 100 meters from churches
God won't forgive me but it still was worth it (ohh yeah)
Man I swear I needed some change, chains, golden rings and thangs
Niggaz watch videos and think them douche in rap's the hardest
But real loc's know that that type of shit make you a target
Either the pigs or I'ma get you while you playin boy
Hunt you like an animal, strapped with a beam that's Adderol
50 told me ambition wins when you're tellin ain't workin
I say I'd rather relapse than re-enact hurdles and put that work in
Yeah~!

[Chorus]

[ScHoolboy Q]
Floss if you want to, I'll send you home broke nigga
It ain't a secret I get money, you's a joke nigga
Make what you make in like two years less than a month nigga
Figg Side to Southside, but we up nigga
Uhh, yeah (gon' fuck around and make a trillion)

[50 Cent]
I woke up this morning, this is insane
Rich as a motherfucker and ain't much change
Open my eyes, no suprise, I'm with a different bitch
Different day, different ass, different tits
Strap under my pillow, I don't want legit
I'm not supposed to do this shit but I forget
The true principles of life are supply and demand
Guess if you never sold dope it's hard to understand
My man got knowledge of self, at my back God
Find out today's mathematics when that Mac go off
My temper volatile, grew up a violent child
Fuck a boy scout - I air yo' ass out
Nigga nice chain, dice game, try your luck
Shoot a couple head cracks, leave you while you up
I'm a fly nigga, my denim vintage
Gold medal 'round my neck like I won the Olympics

[Chorus]
We came from nothin, now they sayin we straight
Nigga hold up, hold on...
Hold on...
These niggaz they watchin every dime we make
Hold up, hold on...
Hold on...

[over Chorus]
You got that?
Let Yayo hold the strap son, it's cool
We got bail money, whatever
Y'all niggaz gotta chill
Just be cool about this shit, relax

[50 Cent]
We want that deluxe apartment in the sky with a clear view
Instead we get the D's in the rear view
We learn to play the game how it's supposed to be played
And so you know you violate you supposed to be sprayed
It's not a big deal to me, stay calm
I'll shoot the shit out a nigga then call the barrel Bonds
If I don't do this shit myself, bet I'll get it done
Shit on my nigga, you shit on me, we are one
Used to do graffiti, now look, we major
Don't make me write my name 'cross your face with a razor
Re-up, new joke, they said this sample the bomb
This shit can take a two then we cut the bitch with a one, uhh
Watch the fiends stand in line for the potency
No lactose involved, pure cocoa leaf
You can sniff that or cook that to my belief
That money comin in like we run the streets

[Chorus]

[over Chorus]
That's a bet
Find my form better
Nigga you got a gamblin problem
I'm winnin, you losin
YOU got the gamblin problem
Yeah... yeah
What's up? What we doin?

[50 Cent]
This shit go how I say it go when it's time to expand
So say it's over your dead body and that's the plan
You a gangster for real, you ready to ride
Nigga you gon' die a bad case of too-much-pride
Check my DNA, homie I'm a different kind
Hit the speed dial that quick, I'll get ya lined
Won't want your block, just cop the work from us
Them niggaz you call allies can't be trust
That Roley all gold, I got the Midas touch
Sometimes it's hard as hell not to touch stuff
On the phone I heard Yay' smacked the shit out a kid
Now Jimmy got life, go smack him again
When it's war, it will be war to the bitter end
If they ever say we lose, I start it again
That sneaky nigga sprayed that semi at yo' momma crib
With a silencer, we couldn't even hear the shit

[Chorus]

[over Chorus]
I don't fuck with them
Pssh, man, these niggaz is roaches man
Dirty ass niggaz
Boy you better be easy
I ain't playin wit'chu boy
Boy you must've bumped yo' motherfuckin head or somethin boy
I don't give a fuck about that old school shit
You talkin 'bout you got me fucked up nigga
Yeah...

[50 Cent]
Yeah (yeah)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Don't worry 'bout how I get my money, bitch just know I get my money
Don't worry 'bout how I spend my money, boy I got a lot
Don't worry 'bout that car I drive, don't worry 'bout that bike I ride
Don't worry 'bout them diamonds in that bezel on my watch
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
Don't worry 'bout a motherfuckin thang
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
We got a strap up in here if niggaz playin

[50 Cent]
When time pass and I'm not around, niggaz sayin I'm out of town
Probably movin them bricks around, they swear they know how I get down
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...
My closet full of that fly shit, black card when I buy shit
Sell the shit you get high with, these niggaz on my dick
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...
That's yo' bitch, I understand, I've seen it all on Instagram
I'm just, from the past, I done been all in that ass
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...

[Chorus]

[Yo Gotti]
Yeah! Nah
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it

Don't be worried 'bout my record deals cause I still got my plug
Don't be worried 'bout my bitch pimpin, she get money out that club (hah)
Don't be worried 'bout my partners and 'em, we get money, we eatin (I am)
You talk shit 'bout a real nigga, bitch you must be tweakin
Don't be worried 'bout my whereabouts, money all I care about
Keepin it real in my neighborhood, play with me and I'ma air it out
Why you worried 'bout my money nigga? Bitch you think I'm broke? (huh?)
The Feds worry 'bout what I'm doin, think I'm sellin dope
I may be and I may not - go to jail I may rot
I ain't never gon' snitch nigga - never been no bitch nigga
I got big guns, need a extra large, y'all niggaz got question marks
Talkin down on a real nigga, that's how you get a hater charged
Yeah

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Don't worry 'bout what they talkin 'bout, don't tell me what that bitch done said
I'm done with her, you can go with her, I'm leavin here with another bitch
Don't worry 'bout how they look at me, my diamonds on, damn look at me
These pussy niggaz be shook of me, wanna judge and throw the book at me
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it, had time to talk to my legal team
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it, ain't shit they could do to me
Still rockin, still rollin (rollin)
We holdin (holdin) bill foldin (foldin) you know it
When I start to ball out, money start to fall out
Throw it up, it fall out the sky~!
Baddest bitches go all out, whole bar get bought out
That's what I call my lifestyle~!

[Chorus]

I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition

While we were loving the fit
She just want some bread
I ain't talking to tits
And I just want some head
She from a Pirus sip
Where all them niggas wear red
I ain't flying no flags but I'm a gangster bitch
I say say no to drugs then I do that shit
Got a blue fleet of whips
I'm so hood nigga rich
You don't like the way I do it nigga eat your dick
I just call em when I want em don't need your bitch
See my blood on these diamonds everything proper
Your shit look grown and your shit look copper
It's turning homie that's why your turning on me
Admit it I made it, I can't be faded
I roll it up in public I'm a cancer man
Smoke it out in the open like I'm in Amsterdam
I do a hundred miles an hour switching lens in my lane
See my name around the globe niggas know who I am

[Chorus]
I got that animal (animal) ambition [x9]

You say you hustle like a hustle I be moving shit
Had a couch and a U-Haul filled up with bricks
Got them straps and long clips filled up with led
So when we count on the paper it better come back correct
We out in New Orleans baby niggas hungry for brick
I do that knife for stuntin get shot in the head
Every hood I go through they fuck with me you dig?
Got the eye of the tiger I'm on that animal shit
I got the heart of a lion and the looks of an elephant
Damn scared of rats, but I'm ready for anything
It's the unit my nigga, take a look at my face
See if you test me they'll arrest me I'll be catching a case
New York is a concrete jungle, where niggas got to get paid
Get in the way of that paper and niggas got to get sprayed
Look at me wrong and your dead
You should be very afraid
I don't know how to behave
I'm tamed fresh out the cage
Urrrrrrrrrrhhhh

[Chorus]

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Me, I'm like a pilot, G5 jet I'm fly as shit
You cannot deny it, oh no, no no no no
Bitches be on my dick, designer threads I'm fly as shit
You cannot deny it, oh no, no no no no
Better back up off me bitch, watch me ball (ball, ball)

E'ry day I get birthday cake, there's a hundred racks there in that safe
Hundred grams there on that plate, I ain't thinkin 'bout catchin no case
Nigga my safe house super safe, I zip Giuseppe's, I don't tie no lace
Tom Ford, Y-S-L, nigga run tell, I'm fly as hell
Big Bentley, Mulsanne, no LP, just two songs
A-side, B-side, Rider Gang, bitch that's right
From N.O. to N.Y., I got shooters bitch; don't act cute and shit
We was born broke, no silver spoon, my niggaz strapped, they super goons
These niggaz here kinda soft, we get the bread then fuck it off
Get mo' money then fuck it off, make yo' bitch wan' suck me off
We ain't had shit, we learned to ball, them ghetto bitches they love us all

[Chorus]

Yo' fuckin head, I'll crack that, you wan' test me? Don't test me
Look lover boy, what you trippin fo'? Niggaz don't even want yo' hoe
My nigga Ill fresh out the pen, you gon' make him go back again
Them bottles comin, we turnt up, them sparks burnin, now watch us shine
You do this shit once a year, we do this shit all the time
Now captain come and save her, get her from 'round this paper
She'll never be the same, I mean like e'rything will change
She cute, blow a lil' cheese on her, get her ass shots, throw D's on her
Them shoes more than you think though, my bitch look like my bank roll

Pink diamonds, pink sand, beaches Aruba
Blue sapphires on days when she feelin Hoover
She hood, and in the mood, when I'm in the mood
Erotic, so exotic, I'm psychotic about it
I don't want forever, I just wanna taste her love
Sample that product, I bet a nigga tongue go numb
She's a narcotic, that bomb shit burnin, we smokin
My old flame, my Mary Jane, we got a love thang
She ain't jealous, I keep Nina around
In the small of my back case some shit go down
Right under my Hermes, I'm hearin the word is, me
I'm a P-I-M-P
I let Trey hit some then Dre hit some
Then pass it to the homies 'til we all get done
Niggaz can't comprehend what this shit 'bout
Police comin {*puff*} put this shit out

[Chorus: Trey Songz] + (50 Cent)
You like smoke and you got me high (you know you make a nigga wan' put it down)

[50 Cent]
Shorty hot, she full blown, she hot now
100 degrees, that's with or without the top down
But when she get to workin her hips, you know the temperature rise
Oh Lord, soon as she see the dick in her thighs
She like the stones in my cross, she flawless
I'm thinkin damn, why would God give one woman all this?
You know I got the kind of conversation that make her feel like she need me
It's complicated, my occupation pimpin ain't easy
Facts, I stack racks on racks and racks
Back when I was pumpin crack, now my cards are black
Nigga get on my level, bark with the big dogs
If I want it I buy it, I don't care what the shit costs
Luther said it, a house is not a home without her
I had them panties on the Greyhound filled up with powder
But when she showed me what she'll do for me, has no limits
Her wantin is temporary cause fo' sho' she gon' get it
What's up?

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz] + (50 Cent)
Everybody showin the love, when she at the do'
Burn this bitch down, that's fire in the hole

Got me addicted, I'm trippin, where the stash at?

Lady, baby - just like smoke and got me high
So high; girl what the fuck you've done to me?
You got me feelin like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke and you got me high (ring the alarm, it's on)

Hood nigga down there on Wall Street, my stock run across NASDAQ
Girl facin my time piece, ridin 'round with my grimies
These Brooklyn niggaz so grimy - I let 'em hold the steel, I tell 'em shoot to kill

[Chorus]

Kidd Kidd, uhh
All my niggaz crazy, stupid, cuckoo, got a loose screw

My bitch come from Honolulu with that dope all in her doo-doo
Put it on a train and choo-choo and the Feds don't have a +Blue's clue+
Slummin over, don't know voodoo but I sure know how to shoot-shoot
If I get caught I don't boo-hoo, I pick up the phone call Boo-Boo
He gon' bail me out in seconds, please don't let this rap shit fool you
I send shooters to your home, see I don't need no songs to move you
My gorillas goin ooh-ooh, all your family could lose you
Put you in a box like new shoes, you's a bitch, pull down your tutu
Any corner gettin money, all I know is we need buku
Speakin on me and my Rida Gang, know what we gon' do to you?
Huh~!

We ain't cut from the same cloth, we into different shit

Come out your mouth slick, I'll get you hit
My niggaz hungry, they hit a lick
Fuck who you're with, niggaz'll dump a clip
We by the school yard waitin for you to get your kid
I caught a A-1 felony on my last bid
Kept calm, made bond, I'm on that shit
You think my rap shit a gimmick
Hm-hm, I ain't seen parole in a minute
Truth be told, these niggaz is hoes
Once the shit set off, man anything goes
Through the windows of your soul, the eyes never lie
If you ain't scared to die nigga why would you cry?

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Mm, mm, mm
30-somethin and you ain't never open your mouth yet (uh-uh)
Social media is givin cowards an outlet (yep)
See 'em in person and say somethin, I doubt that (say somethin)
Rather get caught with it than get caught without that (yep)
Tryin to back-peddle and stumble on the curve (mm)
You starin at the ground (uh) you mumblin your words (yeah)
Literally I can see your heart pumpin through your shirt (haha)
You was pussy your whole life, you always been a bird (pussy)
Scared for so long it's all up in your nerves
Screw 9-1-1, probably call up the Reserves (mm)
And I'm killin you first, if we ever do a purge
And you know what it is kid whenever we emerge (you know)
Tragical (uh) dramatical (yep)
No match, incompatible, nigga, you vaginal
What~!

[Chorus]

[Kidd Kidd]
Money for bail, money to bail
Dead or in jail, Heaven or Hell
Fed's on my coattail, snitches given court tales
Kept fate when all hope fail
Niggaz rattin, all they missin is the tail
Like Mickey Mouse
Call me Mickey Mantle when I bat you in the mouth
I bring them hammers out, we ain't tryin to build a house
Niggaz on them songs rappin shit they ain't about
I'm from the N-O, we don't scrap, we bang it out
Bang! I'm the one that came in your house for the chickens
Left a nigga brains hangin out like we chillin
Stankin like chitlins, over my shillings
Hump your security, Rida Gang in the building
Huh~!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Don't make this complicated (don't make it!)
My old school candy painted (for real!)
I hustle hard
When I come through they're like "Oh my God!" (THAT NIGGA CLEAN!)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
From the beginning it was written I suppose
I break a whole into 36 O's - and move it
I'm a hustler baby (can you dig it?)
I'm a hustler baby
My mind on the money, I ain't trippin on the hoes
I blow a whole lot of paper on clothes - but dig it
I'm a hustler baby (can you dig it?)
I'm a hustler baby

[50 Cent]
Yeah~!
I come through, I have the hoes like "Ooh-wee"
Seats in the old school Louie
The shoes and the belt buckle Louie
We don't need more details now, do we?
Let 'em sag, my swag is True Religion
You gon' need Cartier frames to see my vision
It smells like Creed mixed with weed, this is classy and hood
Drama llama time nigga what's good?
Dominos muh'fucker, it's time to collect
Stack paper like I'm tryin to fix the national debt
I'm just doin what I wanna do, I trip through your set
This is 50 on that Muammar Gaddafi shit

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[50 Cent]
Get on my level bitch, I'm careful who I kick it with
We talk marketin, distribution and politics
Got a chip on my shoulder, chip off the ol' block
I sell a chip off a whole rock $10 a pop
I'm a magnet, a bitch can't help but watch me
Socks, drawers, undershirt, Versace Versace Versace
Designer threads, in every form of fashion
I express myself so the question I'm askin
Is this flip or the next flip, tailor fit the shit
We ain't promised tomorrow, a nigga gone and get the shit
That skull and bones, that Alexander McQueen thing
In case you ain't noticed, it's a Queens thing

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Outro: 50 Cent]
OHHH~! It's cold out here
It's my kind of weather, I'm cold-blooded
It's 50, when I come through you see me, in a Suburban
In this bullet-proof, bomb-proof, leather six whatever
When I go hard I go hard
When I don't want you to see me I switch it up
I'm in that black-on-black Porsche Panamera
In the back like, ooh-wee, we rollin
I hustle man, it's what I do man
What a nigga gon', what a nigga gon' try to tell me?
How to do this?

[Intro: Mr. Probz] + (50)
Here's a little info, you should know (it's 50)
You don't know what you're in for (c'mon, c'mon)
We get the

[Chorus: Mr. Probz] + (50)
Party rockin, bottle poppin
Tonight we gon' turn up 'til we, twisted
Yeahhhhhh (yeah yeah yeah, yeah)
System thumpin, the club is jumpin
Tonight we gon' turn up 'til we, twisted
Yeahhhhhh (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

[50 Cent]
Let's toast to success then take it a lil' higher
May tomorrow bring you everything your heart desires
Let your drivin ambition (uhh) offer you new visions (yeah)
May yo' gut instincts help you make good decisions (c'mon)
This is more than champagne, this is more than just a glass
This a symbol of accomplishment we rarely ever have (ha ha)
Let's enjoy tonight like tonight's our last
We can focus on the future and reflect on the past (woooo!)
We done came so far, I mean look where we are
If they don't call us by our name they call us entrepreneurs
From the block to the board room, the hood to the high life
Skyscraper paper baby, life in the limelight
Want the best of the best, the top of the top
I mean the baddest bitches, you know, the cream of the crop
We gotta hustle and have it, we better than average
More like the elite; my nigga we gotta eat, c'mon

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[50 Cent]
What was once a strike against us has become an advantage
Cause we grind when we at it like we stone-cold addicts
That mastermind, the mental is oh so essential (uhh)
Product of the environment (uhh) they ain't been where we been through (yeah)
I'm fond of the phrase "If there's a will there's a way"
Cause we come from the parts where only killers could play
Southside... it's alright
The ghetto's my Alma Mater, huh? It's alright (OOOH!)
We could keep the party jumpin like this all night
The bottles, just keep 'em comin baby, let's get right
"Let's Get It On"... play a lil' Marvin
It's gettin hot in here, homie this could be a problem
Keni Burke style, let's keep +Risin' to the Top+ (uh)
Let's do it, do it big, now let a fuckin hater watch
Oh yeah, this is perfect, this a moment to remember
As we proceed on our money-gettin agendas (hello~!)

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Chorus: Guordan Banks]
Are you ready to win?
Come join the winners circle
Put up your hands for me baby (put up your hands)
And do it like we're supposed to (do it like we're supposed to)
Oooh, cause we're gonna win

[50 Cent]
Yeah...
Fuck with the winners baby
Come put 'em up
Yeah, yeah, uhh

Consider this the theme song for victory
The shit you say to yourself when you make history
I'm tryin to make it feel like the first time
Like a junkie I'm sort of chasin my first high
I'm focused, I'm disciplined, I'm ready
Mentally on point, sharp as a machete
Hard work, I work hard, I get the job done
It's only one number 1, nigga I'm number 1
I'm confident, you can call it vain or conceited
Cars, clothes, I need it
Condos, condoms and bad bitches to be with, run with a winner baby
Be unconventional, freak me off with your friends maybe
You could be my, girl be my
... fair-weather friend
Or you could, be my, yeah, yeah be my
... friend to the end

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[50 Cent]
I got that disease ambition, success is the cure
They wanna win, I gotta win, I sell the shit pure
I got dopeboy bonds, Einstein brains
The heart of a nigga homicidal on a chain gang
I want yachts and drops, I got spots to watch
I wan' see what life is like from the mountain top
Who says sky's the limit? I'm +Limitless+, I just took the pill
Why you think a nigga slow flow's so ill?
Be careful, the shit I got's highly contagious
We hustle 'til it had us all locked up in cages
Time gon' fly when niggaz been biddin for ages
War stories and wounds, back and forth, niggaz been tradin
For the root of all evil, Lord said it's for Satan
We from the bottom, desperation cause moves that we makin
I guess it's all risk versus rewards
Y'all niggaz risk it all for the broads
What's up?

[Chorus] - 2X w/ ad libs

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Ohhhh, hey, ohhhh, hey
I'm still a rider, I'm still rollin
A nigga still holdin steel, that's how I'm on it
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You a sucker for love, nigga I'm money makin

[50 Cent]
I'm still a bona, I'm still ballin
It's five times I ain't pick up, your bitch still callin
I'm super ghetto, I'm still with the shit
Still pass the steel to my nigga, hit a lick~!
We still +Mobbin+, niggaz still starvin
We still deal after deal, shit is no problem
You still love her, she ain't shit
Get her a pair of Louboutins, she duck a dick
It's still real, niggaz +Still Will Kill+
Tote the steel, bitch don't squeal, get your cap peeled
The Mac filled, black talons, hollow tips, copper tops
Get ya ass popped, watch your body drop

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
I'm still a rider, I'm still rollin
A nigga still holdin steel, that's how I'm on it
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You a sucker for love, nigga I'm money makin

[Kidd Kidd]
Watch this cuz

I'm clean as a muh'fucker still gettin my hands dirty
Bitches they wanna fuck, grab a glass, you lookin thirsty
See I'm a gangsta, you soft {?} as singers
I'm at awards with the banger, in a club with the shanker
Mask all on rangers, scope on the K long ranger
Rather be alive and rich, than die and be famous
Live my life in the fast lane, not crash into anythang
I ain't here to entertain when I let them bullets sang
M-Zone, Rida Gang, slap the fuck out you nigga
Tryna pull out your pistol, when you know that you're lame
You chasin these bitches, instead of chasin yo' paper
Niggaz takin yo' bitches, while they takin yo' paper
I'm gone (Kidd Kidd)

[Chorus]

[Prodigy]
Aiyyo fuck that bitch dunn~!

She on my leg, like a lil' kid
She hump my leg, like a horny bitch
Pit bull in a skirt, yeah I'm a magnet
Nah I ain't runnin after no broad, she stuck on my dick
I'm a different breed, blame it on my genes
Money in my jeans, pocket turn her eyes green
She seein dollar signs, I'm seein reasons why
I never had to stress no pussy, I'm one of a kind
Pretty nigga, with a gorgeous gun
You die a beautiful death, pull a stunt
Look; there ain't a bitch more down than me
The thirst is real, she knockin over drinks to get next to me
While you

[Chorus]

[Styles P]
Tryin to get this money, you know?

Ghetto nigga still'll pick a penny up
You outside chasin them hoes throwin your Henny up
Lil' homie loadin the semi up
Catch 'em all after the club, tell 'em to ante up
Anyway, each and every day
I'm lookin for a better way, you owe me you better pay
Ghost let the Beretta spray
Hood one uncut dope, and some better yay
I ain't chasin pussy, never have
Hustle hard, take a break, run and get some head and ass
Still ridin, still rollin, still need a mask
Still poppin, still slingin, still need the cash

[Chorus]

[Intro: slowed down]
Boy you forgot my style

[50 Cent]
Flowers, funeral service, a kid's in the coffin
It sounds so familiar, don't it happen so often?
The shoot-out shit happens, the sister read the eulogy
Couldn't help but think, "Nigga better you than me"
Trey-eight ain't got no safety, that bullet got no name on it
But it's hard to miss when that thang got a beam on it
First shot pop off, e'rybody poppin
Shot the glass at the store front, we forgot God was watchin
Run run, hit the gate, D's yellin "Drop it"
Niggaz gettin jammed up; better that than a jammed-up
His momma said a few words to her, "He was innocent"
She might've heard he did some shit but never saw no benefits
So in her eyes, he's mommy's lil' baby
But he was outside, talkin to niggaz crazy
In a room full of people came to pay their respect
I just came to get a close look at a nigga to check
That nigga dead as a doorknob, stiff as a nail
And my man, tomorrow he gon' get out of jail
R.O.R., trust me nigga I know the law
Released on your Own Recognizance - that bullshit I'm on it
That's his first taste - I mean his first case
Got knocked with the strap - but not the one that clapped
This nigga here we still got that, yeah
The first law in my hood is show no fear
Him and love was closer than we thought, that nigga in here cryin
Oh shit, in the store he probably passed him the iron
These some grimy ass niggaz, full-breed vultures
Tryin to come up, still eatin around roaches
Cookie Crisp, Cap'n Crunch, breakfast of the champions
Lucky Charms, stay armed, and niggaz won't clap you then
We watch the side bitch talk like she his main bitch
His wifey just sat there, preachers wasn't sayin shit
Right jab, left hook, hand full of weave
This type shit a nigga got to see to believe
These bitches actin up in here, police they don't fuckin care
Homicide snoop around to them, we all with the shit
Cousin back from college sayin he gon' get who did this shit
He a ball player nigga, nigga better play ball
You play with the wrong niggaz we gon' get to lettin off
I done seen enough, feel like it's time for me to split
Hit the parkin lot and chill where the weed is lit
Twist the cap, pour out a little liquor
All the theatrics, you know, like that was my nigga
We all can't win, some of us gotta lose
Envision a lil' dog barkin at a pack of wolves
Cause that's what happened; yeah yeah, that's what happened
He just went on and on 'til niggaz started attackin
Actin like he was the only motherfucker packin

Fifty bars of pleasure, fifty bars of pain
When I'm dead and I'm gone niggaz will remember the name
It's 50... yeah, yeah
Fifty bars of pleasure, fifty bars of pain
When I'm dead and I'm gone niggaz will remember the name
It's 50... yeah, yeah, haha

See low we know
I'm sitting on leather I'm a winner
If I crap out the strap out
Cause I snap right back to the beginning nigga

[Chorus]
You know I will let it pop front if you want bitch I will make it hot
You (rrr) know you think you ill but you not
You will need a tombstone you will need a plot (yeah)

I peep what niggas hate through my peripherals
Boy if I leave this club back to the car I got some shit for you
Want party? We can paint the town red
Them bottles ain't shit to me a nigga got bread
I'm big money big business I love it
For the bad bitches with big asses and the budgets I'm the boss
Until you know shit is going how it got to go
I don't want talk tonight I might just buy the hoes
My pleasure principle spender's expense
First I'm happy then she happy then she can pay the rent
It's nothing to a nigga when he up
But when they down I bet you he won't give up at your bump
Flipping will catch your attitude 'like bitch what the fuck you want from a nigga huh?, you fucking up nigga huh?'
Look girl you know you sitting on a gold mine
Fuck with them other niggas think you so fine

[Chorus x2]

My flow hotter than the gun after that clip done
Don't care about the sit you claim mother fuck the finger bang
I hang around with hustlers and hoodlums that party get the popping
Then we beefing and we shooting
Let's party like it's 1999 flat top [?]
Swag going back in time
I got it locked they can't ignore it
My nigga know some bullshit I'm all for it
[?] Don seven sixty leaning
Chrome clean spend a nigga scheming trying to hit a lick
Them victim niggas thinking damn why me
I'm thinking why these niggas never try me
Maybe they feel the vibe they know a nigga lie
I let it off inside and outside
The club rocking it's on tonight
Them bottle's popping we getting right

[Chorus]

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Schoolboy Q]
Smiling...?
Nigga you gon' make me Flip On You!
You gon' make me flip this knife out do some shit to you!
Nigga you gon' make me Flip On You!
Nigga you gon' make me-you gon' make me Flip On You!
Nigga you gon' make me Flip On You!
You gon make me pull the strap out, do some shit to you!
Nigga you gon' make me Flip On You!
Nigga you ain't gon' be moving when this clip is through!

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
Nigga, I'm the one that bought all them bitches out
Got a G-A-T this MVP don't run his mouth, nigga
You gon' make me fill this clip for you
You gon' make me unload then reload 'em number 2
Nigga, I've been known to get them Oxys off
I believe in God, but cross my heart this knock go off
Nigga, I'm from the Mecca of the Groove
The Hoover Crip, I grew up on Figg I had to dodge them County Blues
Live my life behind the rules
Running from the cops, smash the rocks up under my shoes
Spit out the eighth that once, hid in my face
Bounce spring over the gate, didn't get caught
I guess my escape, nigga was fate
I love the block and all the dogs that kept me safe
Now it's, back to adding, points to the crime rate
Get slumped in your drive way
You gon' make me hurt your boy
You gon' make me put that work in boy
You gon' make me get to murkin' boy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Focus on money, I'm in and out ass fast
She loosen up against the wall like a NASCAR crash
Got a bunch of enemies, I count my friends on one hand
Ghetto philosophy, watch me, I got a hundred scams
Like we could make a few dollars, that there a hundred grams
I got a gift, I communicate with the afterlife
Apparently, your bitch ass ain't acting right
Niggas killed your man, you ain't gon' get him back?
What? You is tired out? Why you ain't get around to that?
[?] I travel, I have a destination
I'll be a street legend new version of Pappy Mason
My style? It'll never die, boy I'm a model
You shoot me down, I'll get back up and keep coming for you
Man on fire, hitman for hire
Them niggas got happy they thought I was gon' retire
Now they bitch giving me head, I'm the man, a man admires
What's up?

[Chorus]
