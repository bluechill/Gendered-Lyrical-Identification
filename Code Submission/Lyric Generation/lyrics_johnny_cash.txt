"Rock Island Line"
Now this here's a story about the Rock Island Line
Well the Rock Island Line she runs down into New Orleans
There's a big tollgate down there and you know
If you got certain things on board when you go through the tollgate
Well you don't have to pay the man no toll
Well a train driver he pulled up to the tollgate
And a man hollered and asked him what all he had on board and said
I got livestock
I got livestock
I got cows
I got pigs
I got sheep
I got mules
I got all live stock
Well he said you're alright boy you don't have to pay no toll
You can just go right on through so he went on through the tollgate
And as he went through he started pickin' up a little bit of speed
Pickin' up a little bit of steam
He got on through he turned and looked back at the man he said
Well I fooled you
I fooled you
I got pigiron
I got pigiron
I got old pigiron
[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line
Looked cloudy in the west and it looked like rain
Round the curve came a passenger train
North bound train on a southbound track
He's alright a leavin' but he won't be back
[Chorus]
Oh I may be right and I may be wrong
But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Well the engineer said before he died
There were two more drinks that he'd like to try
The conductor said what could they be
A hot cup of coffee and a cold glass of tea
[Chorus]


"(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle"
He was riding Number 9
Heading south from Caroline
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow
Got in trouble, had to roam
Left his gal and left his home
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow
Just a kid, acting smart
He went and broke his darling's heart
I guess he was too young to know
They took him off the Georgia Main
Locked him to a ball and chain
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow
All alone he bears the shame
He's a number, not a name
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow
All he does is sit and cry
When the evening train goes by
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow
He'll be locked there in this cell
Til his body's just a shell
And his hair turns whiter than snow
He'll never see that gal he pines
He's in Georgia doing time
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow


"Country Boy"
Country boy, ain't got no shoes
Country boy, ain't got no blues
Well, you work all day
While you're wantin' to play
In the sun and the sand
With a face that's tan
At the end of the day
When your work is done
You ain't got nothin' but fun
Country boy, ain't got no ills
Country boy, don't owe no bills
Country boy, ain't got no ills
Country boy, don't owe no bills
You get a wiggly worm
And then you watch him squirm
While you put him on a hook
And you drop him in a brook
If everything's gonna turn out right
You're gonna fry fish tonight
Country boy, got a lot to lose
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes
[Instrumental break]
Country boy, you got a shaggy dog
Country boy, up a holler log
Well, he comes in a run
When you pick up your gun
And with a shell or two
And your dog and you
When you get your rabbit
You'll skin his hide
He's gonna be good fried
Country boy, you got a lot to lose
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes
[Instrumental break]
Country boy, you got work to do
Country boy, in the morning dew
You gotta plant the seed
You gotta cut the weeds
There's many a row
You know you gotta hoe
When it's quittin' time
And your work is through
There's a lot of life in you
Country boy, you lucky thing
Country boy, I wish I was you, and you were me
Unchained


"If The Good Lord's Willing"
If the good Lord's willing and the creek stays down
I'll be in your arms time the moon come around
For a taste of love that's shining in your eyes
If the rooster crows at the crackin' of the dawn
I'll be there just as sure as you're born
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
I'll comb my hair down brush my teeth
Shine up slick up dress up neat
Get everything looking just right
Cause I want to look pretty when I see you tonight
Just as sure as the rabbits are a jumping in the hollow
I'll be there you can bet your bottom dollar
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
If the good Lord's willing and the creek stays low
I'll be there a knockin' at your door
With a hug and a kiss for the one I idolize
I'll wear my suit, my Sunday best, I'll be there lookin' my best
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
I'll feed the mules and stop the hogs feed the cows and chop all the logs
Get all of my working done cause tonight we're gonna have lots of fun
Just as sure as there ever was a preacher man
I'll be there with a ring for your hand
If the good Lord's willing and the creek don't rise


"Cry, Cry, Cry"
Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down
I think you only live to see the lights uptown
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try
Cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry
Soon your sugar
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you
Bye, bye, bye
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own
You're gonna cry, cry, cry
I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry
When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me why, why, why
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been
You're gonna cry, cry, cry
Now Here's Johnny Cash


"Remember Me (I'm The One Who Loves You)"
When you're all alone and blue
No one to tell your troubles to
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
When this world turns you down
Not a true friend can be found
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
And through all kinds of weather
You'll find, I'll never change
Through the sunshine and the shadows
I'll always be the same
We're together right or wrong
Where you go I'll tag along
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
And through all kinds of weather
You'll find, I'll never change
Through the sunshine and the shadows
I'll always be the same
We're together right or wrong
Where you go I'll tag along
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you


"So Doggone Lonesome"
I do my best to hide this lowdown feelin'
I try to make believe there's nothin' wrong
But they're always askin' me about you darlin'
And it hurts me so to tell 'em that you're gone
If they ask me, I guess, I'd be denyin'
That I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it cryin'
Where's my darlin' when's she comin' home
I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
Well I make it pretty good until that moon comes shinin' through
And that I get so doggone lonesome
Time stands still when you're a waitin'
Sometimes I think my heart is stoppin' too
One lonely hour seems forever
Sixty minutes more to wait for you
But I guess I'll keep waitin' till you're with me
Cause I believe that lovin' you is right
But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow
If I can't have you with me tonight
Well I know, I'll keep on loving you 'cause true love can't be killed
I ought to get you off of my mind but I guess I never will
I could have a dozen others but I know, I'd love you still
Cause I get so doggone lonesome
Now Here's Johnny Cash


"I Was There When It Happened"
There are some people who say we cannot tell
Whether we are saved or whether all is well
They say we only can hope and trust that it is so
Well, I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know
Yes, I know when Jesus saved me, saved my soul
The very moment He forgave me, made me whole
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within, peace within
Satan can't make me doubt it, I won't doubt it
It's real and I'm gonna shout it, I'm gonna shout it
I was there when it happened
And so I guess I ought to know
I don't care who tells me salvation is not real
Though the world may argue, that we cannot feel
The heavy burden's lifted and the vile sins go
I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know
Yes, I know when Jesus saved me, saved my soul
The very moment He forgave me, made me whole
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within, peace within
Satan can't make me doubt it, I won't doubt it
It's real and I'm gonna shout it, I'm gonna shout it
I was there when it happened
And so I guess I ought to know

"I Walk The Line"
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
At San Quentin
I Walk The Line


"Wreck Of The Old '97"
They gave him his orders at Monroe Virginia
Sayin' Steve you're way behind time
This is not 38 this is old 97
Put her into Spencer on time
Well he turned around and said to his big greasy fireman
Hey shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Ol' Mountain
Watch ol' 97 roll
It's a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville
In a line on a three mile grade
It was on that grade that he lost his air brake
You see what a jump we made
He was goin' down the grade makin' 90 miles an hour
His whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam
Now all you ladies you better take a warnin'
From this time on and learn
Never speak harsh words to your true lover husband
He may leave you and never return


"Folsom Prison Blues"
I hear the train a comin'
It's rolling round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone
When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin'
And that's what tortures me
Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
At San Quentin


"Doin' My Time"
On this old rock pile with a ball and chain
They call me by a number, not a name Lord, Lord
Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
With an achin' heart and a worried mind
When that old judge looked down and smiled
Said I put you up that river for a while Lord, Lord
Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
With an achin' heart and a worried mind
You can hear my hammer, you can hear my saw
Gonna swing it like John Henry all day long Lord, Lord
Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
With an achin' heart and a worried mind
Well now it won't be long just a few more days
I'll settle down and quit my rowdy ways Lord, Lord
With that gal of mine, with that gal of mine
She's waited for me while I've done my time


"Run Softly, Blue River"
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)
Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep
Oh I thrill to her kisses and she thrills to mine
Run softly while she sleeps and dreams for a time
Cause she dreams of tomorrow when she'll be my wife
And I pray that as peaceful as you is our life
And if your murmuring soothes me till I'm sleeping too
Run softly Blue River we'll both dream with you
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)
Oh I thrill to her kisses
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)


"Frankie's Man Johnny"
Well now, Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
They were true as a blue, blue sky
He was a long
But he was her man nearly all of the time
Well, Johnny he packed up to leave her, but he promised he'd be back
He said he had a little pickin' to do a little farther down the track
He said
I'm your man, I wouldn't do you wrong
Well, Frankie curled up on the sofa, thinkin' about her man
Far away the couples were dancing to the music of his band
He was Frankie's man, he wadn't doin' her wrong
Then, in the front door walked a redhead, Johnny saw her right away
She came down by the bandstand to watch him while he played
He was Frankie's man, but she was far away
He sang every song to the redhead, she smiled back at him
Then he came and sat at her table where the lights were low and dim
What Frankie didn't know wouldn't hurt her none
Then the redhead jumped up and slapped him, she slapped him a time or two
She said
I'm Frankie's sister and I was checking up on you
If you're her man you better treat her right
Well, the moral of this story is be good but carry a stick
Sometimes it looks like a guitar picker just can't tell what to pick
He was Frankie's man and he still ain't done her wrong


"That's All Over"
Mhm mhm when you left I shed a million teardrops over you
But that's all over my crying days are through
When you left my heart was cold and every day was blue
But that's all over I've found somebody new
Someone that can make me happy make me wanna smile
Someone I'm gonna have around me for a long long while
Someday we may meet again but I won't fall for you
That's all over I've found somebody new mhm mhm
Someone that can make me happy
Yes that's all over I've found somebody new mhm mhm


"Troubadour"
(Troubadour troubadour troubadour)
The troubadour the troubadour sings from his heart
The song that's the hit of the show
Watch him sing and play the strings of his guitar alone in the bright spotlight's glow
The song was for someone he loved so true
Who loved him then left him for someone new
The troubaour the troubadour smile as he sings but his heart is breaking in two
They beg for more the troubadour sings once again
The song that's the hit of the show
Watch him sing and play the strings of his guitar alone in the bright spotlight's glow
There is a hush in the darkened hall a few hearts are heavy and teardrops fall
But in the crowd one head is bowed for the troubadour
And oh her heart aches most of all
Troubadour troubadour her heart aches most of all


"That's Enough"
Well now I heard that you been thinking bout me really I don't mind
I know you try to block my progress a lot of the time
Well the mean things you said don't make me feel bad
Cause I can't miss a friend that I never had
(I've got) I've got Jesus and that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
When I'm sick (he's there) and troubled (he's there)
When I call him he will answer my prayers (answer my prayers)
When I'm burdened (he's there) with a load (he's there)
That's when Jesus is a comforter (to my soul)
Well you may scorn me turn your back on me
God's got his arms wrapped all around me
(I've got) I've got Jesus and that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
You know there's been a lotta times that I didn't have a dime
And I didn't cry to nobody but my Lord
He heard my plea and came to see about me cause he's one thing I can afford
So if you push me down he'll pick me up
And he'll stick by me when the goin' gets tough
(I've got) I've got Jesus and that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
Well he's the great emancipator and my heart regulator (Jesus is) yes he is
He'll make my way brighter and my burdens lighter yes he will (Jesus will)
Well you may scorn me turn your back on me
God's got his arms wrapped all around me
And he fights down the devil till he makes him give up
And that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
When I'm sick (he's there)
A Believer Sings The Truth


"One More Ride"
I long for the trip don't need no grip I'm takin' one more ride
Way out there in the prairie air I guess it's in my hide
Oh the clickety clack of the railroad track is callin'
If a man could know where the Santa Fe goes when she gets under steam
And the big loud bell that bongs farewell to hear her whistle scream
She's bound to go where there ain't no snow a fallin'
One more ride
One more ride
I miss the gloom of the prairie moon that seemed to know my name
And the tumbleweed where the prairie don't feed I miss them just the same
They're all a part of a song of heart I'm sayin'
I recall the tune that I sang to the moon and it seemed to make it smile
And I rode away at the close of day and I stayed so long awhile
But I long to be where the memory is ringing
One more ride
One more ride
As the years go by I wonder why I longed to leave my home
And to hit the trail of the iron rail away out there alone
But my heart would sigh till I know that I am leavin'
If I don't come back on a oneway track way down from Mexico
You could find me there or any old where that a tumbleweed will grow
It's a goodbye now you'll never know how I'm grievin'
One more ride
One more ride


"I Still Miss Someone"
At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind has come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone
I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
because I still miss someone
Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
At San Quentin


"Don't Take Your Guns To Town"
A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out
[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town
He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away
[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town
He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again
[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town
He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words
[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town
Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered 'round
And wondered at his final words
[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town


"I'd Rather Die Young"
I'd rather die young than grow old without you
So don't ever leave me whatever you do
To see someone's picture where my picture hung
Believe me my darling I'd rather die young
I'd rather die young than grow old without you
So don't ever leave me whatever you do
Though others may tempt you and tell you they care
You'll find only sorrow in a secret affair
Don't leave me never leave me please don't leave me never leave me
I'd rather die young
I'd rather die young


"Pickin' Time"
I got cotton in the bottom land
It's up and growin' and I got a good stand
My good wife and them kids of mine
Gonna get new shoes, come Pickin' Time
Get new shoes come Pickin' Time
Ev'ry night when I go to bed
I thank the Lord that my kids are fed
They live on beans eight days and nine
But I get 'em fat come Pickin' Time
Get 'em fat come come Pickin' Time
The corn is yellow and the beans are high
The sun is hot in the summer sky
The work is hard til layin' by
Layin' by til Pickin' Time
Layin' by til Pickin' Time
It's hard to see by the coal
And I turn it off purty early at night
Cause a jug of coal
But I stay up late come Pickin' Time
Stay up late come Pickin' Time
My old wagon barely gets me to town
I patched the wheels and I watered 'em down
Keep her in shape so she'll be fine
To haul my cotton come Pickin' Time
Haul my cotton come Pickin' Time
Last Sunday mornin' when they passed the hat
It was still nearly empty back where I sat
But the preacher smiled and said that's fine
The Lord'll wait til Pickin' Time
The Lord'll wait til Pickin' Time


"Shepherd Of My Heart"
You're the shepherd of my heart so treat it tenderly
It's a heart that needs your everloving care
You're the shepherd of my heart until eternity lead it not into the valley of despair
While it's in your keeping guard it with your love
Shelter it from harm along life's way
You're the shepherd of my heart and darling honestly
It's a heart that will not ever go astray
You're the shepherd of my heart so surely you must know
You have but to speak and my heart will obey
It's at your command my dear because it loves you so
So my darling shepherd guide it where you may
If it be green pastures or a rocky road it will follow you and not ask why
You're the shepherd of my heart until the trumpet blows
And I go to meet the shepherd in the sky


"Suppertime"
Many years ago in days of childhood I used to play till evening shadows came
Then winding down an old familiar pathway I hear my mother call at setting sun
Come home come home it's suppertime the shadows lengthen fast
Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last
Through the distant clouds I see my mother
Her face is shining bright, with tender love
She's gone up in heaven, with her maker
And I can still hear her voice, from up above
(and she said)
Come home come home it's suppertime the shadows lengthen fast
Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last


"Oh, What A Dream"
I dreamed I walked in a field of flowers
Oh, what a dream
The houses all were silver towers
Oh, what a dream
Beside the road an angel sat
I said hello and tipped my hat
And stopped when I saw her smile
And set me down a while
I set me down a while
You dreamer you
I tried the angel for a kiss
Oh, what a dream
But she turned away and my lips missed
Oh, what a dream
She said
Sir, I'll have you know
I met you just a while ago
You're welcome for to sit
But calm yourself a bit, sir
Calm yourself a bit
You dreamer you
I fell in love like one, two, three
Oh, what a dream
I asked the angel to marry me
Oh, what a dream
She said
Sir, I can't marry you
But I'm a dream that can come true
There are dreams of much my worth
That live upon the earth, sir
Live upon the earth
You dreamer you
Then I awoke and found my love
Oh, what a dream
As heavenly as the one above
Oh, what a dream
We'll marry in a sea of flowers
Home will be a silver tower
There'll be heaven in my life
With an angel for a wife
With an angel for a wife
You dreamer you
You dreamer you


"Mama's Baby"
She said that she just couldn't leave her mother
I met a girl in our town I tour all my resistance down
I thought what a dream this gonna be
I live with her a month or two and like any boy in love will do
Ask her if she would marry me
But she was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
Though she love me like she never love the other
She was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother
Then I said well then probably the only thing that's left for me it's a going come back in a year
And so, the year past away, and then I try to win her hand again
She even pact her close, but wouldn't go
Cause she was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
Though she love me like she never love the other
She was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother
Well I hang around till finally I asked her to marry me
Her mother says that it would be alright
We bought ourselfs a little home
And I finally got her all alone but she stays with her mother every night
Cause she's a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
Though she love me like she never love the other
She was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother
Well she said that she just couldn't leave


"Fool's Hall Of Fame"
Well if I live to be a hundred, I won't forget the day
I broke the heart you gave me and let you walk away
That's when they hung my name in the fool's hall of fame
Ah baby since we've been apart, I can't console my heart
It cries and cries all night long
Can't I ever make you see this change you've made in me
Just give me a chance to tell you I was wrong
Yes they say that you'll forgive me and end this misery
You know I'll keep on a beggin till you come back to me
Don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame
Ah baby since we've been apart I can't console my heart
It cries and cries all night long
Baby can't you ever see the change you've made in me
Just give me a chance to tell you I was wrong
Yes they say that you'll forgive me and end this misery
You know I'll keep on beggin till you come back to me
Don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame
Don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame


"I'll Remember You"
I'll remember you
Long after this endless summer has gone
I'll be lonely oh so lonely
Living only to remember you
I'll remember too
Your voice as soft as the warm summer breeze
Your sweet laughter, mornings after
Ever after, I'll remember you
To your arms someday I'll return to stay
Till then I will remember too
Every bright start we made wishes upon
Love me always, promise always
Oooh, youll remember too
More Of Old Golden Throat


"Cold Shoulder"
There's a fire burning bright at our house tonight
Slow music playing and soft candlelight
On her lips I keep tasting the warm red wine
I'm there in her arms but it's all in my mind
The snow is piled high on the highway tonight
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover
I wish I could hold her instead of hugging this old cold shoulder
This old highway us like a woman
Sometimes she can be your best friend
But she's the real jealous kind
She's the lady that leads me to the life I dream of
She's the mistress that keeps me from the ones that I love
The snow is piled high on the highway tonight
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover
I wish I could hold her instead of hugging this old cold shoulder
God, I wish I could hold her instead of hugging this old cold shoulder


"Walking The Blues"
Old Apache squaw how many long lean years you saw
How many bitter winter nights shiverin' in a cold teepee shiverin' in a cold teepee
Old Apache squaw how many hungry kids you saw
How many bloody warriors runnin' to the sea fleein' to the sea
Well now they tell me that you saw Cochise when he made his last stand
He said the next white man that sees my face is gonna be a dead white man
Old Apache squaw how many broken hearts you saw
Have you had misty eyes for years could that mist be tears could that mist be tears
Well now they tell me
Old Apache squaw


"Goodbye Little Darlin' Goodbye"
Goodbye, little darlin', we're parting
Parting don't always mean goodbye
Although we had to part, you're always in my heart
Goodbye, little darlin', goodbye
Goodbye, little darlin', I'll miss you
Miss you like the stars would miss the sky
I hate to see you go, I'm gonna miss you so
Goodbye, little darlin', goodbye
Goodbye, little darlin', I love

"I Just Thought You'd Like To Know"
I just thought you'd like to know
Since you'd made your plans to go
It's gonna hurt me so to see you go
But I hope you find another love and he'll be good to you
But still and yet I can't forget the things we used to do
I just thought I tell you this
I love you since that first sweet kiss
It's gonna hurt to miss your tender kiss
But I hope you get to do the things you say you wanna do
But still and yet I can't forget the happiness we knew
I just thought you'd like to know how much you've hurt my pride
I just thought you'd like to know how much my heart has cried over you
But darling you could never see the misery you caused for me
So I will tell you so cause I just thought that you'd like to know


"You Tell Me"
Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried
Tell you why I stayed around tell me why she lied
I'll tell why my heart's broken tell me why she said goodbye
Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried
You tell me then I'll tell you
I'll tell you why I loved her tell me why she said goodbye
Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried
Tell me why I'm lonely I'll tell you why I'm alone
Tell you why I stayed around tell me why she's gone
I'll tell why my heart's broken tell me why she was untrue
Tell me why she left me and I'll tell you why I'm blue
You tell me then I'll tell you


"Just About Time"
(Just about time I'm feelin' blue tryin' to get over you)
Maybe it's just about time I told you I'm all through with you
But just about the time I start to tell you I start feeling blue
And just about then I lose my nerve and wait another day or two
Cause just about the time I think it's over I start missing you
(Hardest thing I'll ever do tryin' to get over you)
It's just about time I had my sayin' I told you a thing or two
It's just about time I paid you back you treat me like you do
But just about the time I get the nerve I can't seem to carry through
Cause just about then an mpty feelin' reminds me I miss you
(Like to find somebody new I could just get you)
(Just don't know what I go through tryin' to get over you)
It's just about time I let you know I've had my fill of you
But just about the time I think about goin' I start missin' you
I'd like to go find another love that'll never be untrue
But just about the time I think about leavin' I start missin' you
(Havin' a hard time feelin' blue tryin' to get over you)


"I Forgot To Remember To Forget"
I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
but I found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time
The day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
The day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget

"Katy Too"
I'm not the going steady kind

I told Annie I'd be true
But I still think about Katy too
Katy too, Katy too
I still think about Katy too
If you should see miss Mary

"Thanks A Lot"
You're tellin' everyone in town that I don't treat you right
You even say I stay away and don't come home at night
I'm losing you and you are all I've got thanks a lot thanks a lot
It seems you like to hurt me and you know I'm good to you
I'd give you anything I own do anything you want me to
Yeah now you really got me on the spot thanks a lot thanks a lot
Still I would forgive you if you'd let me I'd be glad if we could try again
But it seems that you're just out to get me
And it looks as if you're just about to win
No matter what you do I'll always do love you
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
And you're callin' me those things you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot
No matter what you do I always do love you
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
You say I'm happy but you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot thanks a lot


"Luther Played The Boogie"
We were just a plain ol' hillbilly band with a plain ol' country style
We never played the kind of songs that'd drive anybody wild
Played a railroad song with a stomping beat
We played a blues song, kinda slow and sweet
But the thing that knocked them off of their feet was, ooh
When Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie in the strangest kind of way
Play it strange
Well, we did our best to entertain everywhere we'd go
We'd nearly wear our fingers off to give the folks a show
Played jumping jive to make 'em get in the groove
We played sad songs, real slow and smooth
But the only thing that'd make 'em move was, ooh
When Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie
Now, did Luther play the boogie strange


"You Win Again"
The news is out all over town
That you've been seen out runnin' around
I know that I should leave, but then
I just can't go
You win again
This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trusting in you was my great sin
What can I do
You Win Again
Yes this heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trusting you was my great sin
What can I do
You Win Again


"Hey Good Lookin'"

"I Could Never Be Ashamed Of You"
Everybody says you let me down I should be ashamed to take you round
Makes no difference what you used to do darling I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way
In my heart I know that you'll come true darling I could never be ashamed of you
All the happiness I've ever known came the day you said you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe you've been cheated in the past and perhaps those memories will always last
Even though you prove to be untrue darling I could never be ashamed of you


"Get Rhythm"
Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock 'n' roll feelin' in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues
A Little shoeshine boy never gets low down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes
How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all the trouble from your worried mind
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on , get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock 'n' roll feelin' in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was gonna jump for joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a poppin' and he said again
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe
Does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm when you get the blues

"Rock And Roll Ruby"
Well I took my Ruby jukin'
On the out
She took her high heels off
And rolled her stockings down
She put a quarter in the jukebox
To get a little beat
Everybody started watchin'
All the rhythm in her feet
She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
When Ruby starts a
Boy it satisfies my soul
Now Ruby started rockin' 'bout one o'clock
And when she started rockin'
She just couldn't stop
She rocked on the tables
And rolled on the floor
And Everybody yelled
Ruby rock some more
She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
When Ruby starts a
Boy it satisfies my soul
It was 'round about four
I thought she would stop
She looked at me and then
She looked at the clock
She said
Wait a minute Daddy
Now don't get sour
All I want to do
Is rock a little bit more
She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
When Ruby starts a
Boy it satisfies my soul
One night my Ruby left me all alone
I tried to contact her on the telephone
I finally found her about twelve o'clock
She said
Leave me alone Daddy
cause your Ruby wants to rock
She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
When Ruby starts a
Boy it satisfies my soul
Rock, rock, rock'n'roll

Rock, rock, rock'n'roll
When Ruby starts a
Boy it satisfies my soul


"It Was Jesus"
Well a man walked down by Galilee
So the holy book does say
And a great multitude was gathered there
Without a thing to eat for days
Up stepped a little boy with the basket
Please take this, Lord
he said
And with just a five loaves and two little fishes
Five thousand had fish and bread
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
It was Jesus Christ, our Lord
Now pay close attention little children
It's somebody you ought to know
It's all about a man that walked on earth
Nearly two thousand years ago
Well he healed the sick and afflicted
And he raised 'em from the dead
Then they nailed him on an old rugged cross
And put thorns on his head
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
It was Jesus Christ, our Lord
Well they took him down and they buried him
And after the third day
When they came to his tomb where they knew he was gone
Cause the stone was rolled away
He's not here for he is risen
The angel of the Lord then said
And when they saw him walking with these nail
They knew he came back from the dead
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
It was Jesus Christ, our Lord


"I Saw A Man"
Last night I dreamed an angel came
He took my hand, he called my name
He bid me look the other way
I saw a man, I heard him say
He said if I be lifted up
I'll draw all men to me
He turned and then I saw
the nail
that bled for me
I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there
My life my heart I gave
my soul was in his care
When I awoke my heart beat so and in the dark I saw a glow
This was no dream he turned my way
Again I heard my Saviour say
He said if I be lifted up
I'll draw all men to me
He turned and then I saw
the nail
that bled for me
I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there

"Are All The Children In"
When I'm alone I often think of an old house on the hill
Of a big yard hedged in roses where we ran and played at will
And when the night time brought us home hushing our merry din
Mother would look around and ask are all the children in
Well it's been many a year now and the old house on the hill
No longer has my mother's care and the yard is still so still
But if I listen I can hear it all no matter how long it's been
I seem to hear my mother ask are all the children in
And I wonder when the curtain falls on that last earthly day
When we say goodbye to all of this to our pain and work and play
When we step across the river where mother so long has been
Will we hear ask her a final time are all the children in (I come)


"The Old Account"
Well it was a time on earth when in the books of heaven
An old account was standing for sins yet unforgiven
My name was at the top and many things below
But I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees) long ago (I settled it all)
Yes the old account was settled long ago (hallelujah)
And the record's clear today cause he washed my sins away
And the old account was settled long ago
Well the old account was large and growin' every day
And I was always sinnin' and I never tried to pray
But when I looked ahead and saw such pain and woe
Well I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees)
Now sinner seek the Lord repent of all your sins
Cause this he has commanded if you would enter in
And then if you should live a hundred years below
Well you know you got it settled cause you settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees)


"Lead Me Gently Home"
Oh lead me gently home father
Lead me gently home
When life's toils are ended
And parting days have come
Sin no more will tempt me
There from thee I'll roam
If you'll only lead me father
Lead me gently home
Oh lead me gently home father
Lead me gently home father
If I fall upon the wayside
Lead me gently home
Lead me gently home father
Lead me gently home
In life's darkest hours father
When my troubles come
Keep my feet from wandering
There from thee I'll roam
Lest I fall upon the wayside
Lead me gently home
Oh lead me gently home father
Lead me gently home father
If I fall upon the wayside
Lead me gently home
Lead me gently home


"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"
I looked over Jordan and what did i see
Commin' for to carry me home
There was a band of angels, a
Commin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Commin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Commin' for to carry me home
I'm sometimes up, and i'm sometimes down
Comin' for to carry me home
But but i know my soul is heavenly bound
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
If you get there before I do
Comin' for to carry me home
Tell all my friends that I'm a
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Commin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Commin' for to carry me home
And now they're commin for to carry me home


"Snow In His Hair"
The years have been many, the years have been long
But at last I'm returning to daddy and home
He's looking my way though he hardly can see
God bless my old daddy he recognize me
There's snow in his hair and I helped to put it there
A halo of worry and care
As my daddy grows old he's more precious than gold
For I cherish the snow in his hair
His shoulders were bent with the weight of the years
I scarcely could hold back the flood tide of tears
He walked with a cane as he hurried along
Comin' to meet me to welcome me home
There's snow in his hair and I helped to put it there
A halo of worry and care
As my daddy grows old he's more precious than gold
For I cherish the snow in his hair


"Lead Me Father"
When my hands are tired and my step is slow
Walk beside me and give me the strength to go
Fill my face with Your courage, so defeat won't show
Pick me up when I stumble, so the world won't know
Lead me Father, with the staff of life
Give me the strength for a song
That the words I sing might more strength bring
To help some poor troubled, weary worker along
When my way is light but I still can see
With a strong hand, strike out the blindness in me
Show me work that I should carry on for Thee
Make my way straight and narrow like You wanted to be
Lead me Father, with the staff of life
Give me the strength for a song
That the words I sing might more strength bring
To help some poor troubled, weary worker along


"I Call Him"
Well, the blue's still in the water and the blue's still in the sky
And way beyond the blue there's someone watchin' from on high
My clothes may be ragged and my shoes may be worn
But I've been a wealthy boy since I've been born
Cause I call Him when I'm troubled and I call Him when I'm weak
And He always pulls me through my troubles some way and I believe
He'll be there
(He'll be there)
He'll be there
(He'll be there)
Like He always is to answer when I call Him
My mother used to tell me I should take it slow
The pace is not what matters, it's the direction that you go
Keep your feet upon the path and your eyes upon the goal
You'll have all the joy a heart could ever hold
And I call Him when I'm troubled and I call Him when I'm weak
And He always pulls me through my troubles some way and I believe
He'll be there
(He'll be there)
He'll be there
(He'll be there)
Like He always is to answer when I call Him
Like He always is to answer when I call Him


"These Things Shall Pass"
These things shall pass and some great morning
We'll look back and smile at heartaches we have known
So don't forget when shadows gather
The Lord our God is still the King upon His throne
A rose looks gray at midnight but the flame is just asleep
And steel is strong because it knew the hammer and white heat
These things shall pass and life be sweeter
When love and faith are strong they cannot long endure
These things shall pass so don't you worry
The darkest time is just one hour before dawn
So hold up high and face your troubles
And don't dispare if you must face them all alone
A rose looks gray at midnight but the flame is just asleep
And steel is strong because it knew the hammer and white heat
These things shall pass and life be sweeter
When love and faith are strong they cannot long endure
These things shall pass


"He'll Be A Friend"
Well, God told Noah to build an ark
He said it's gonna rain, gonna be dark
Call in the animals two by two
And don't let a sinful man go through
So the flood came just like He said
And every evil thing on earth was dead
But Noah's faith was like a rock
God laid his ark on a mountain top
He'll be a friend and guide you
He'll walk along with you
You'll feel it there inside you
He'll help you make it through
When things look dark Noah saw the light
Cause faith had told him right was might
If you need a friend He'll guide you
He'll be a friend to you
Well, you've heard of Samson, the strong man
The mightiest man in all the land
There was one purpose for his might
He had to deliver the Israelites
By the Philistines he was overcome
They tied him up to carry him home
But Samson prayed and his bounds were gone
He killed a thousand with an old jawbone
He'll be a friend and guide you
He'll walk along with you
You'll feel it there inside you
He'll help you make it through
God showed Samson what to do
And it's the same God that stands by you
If you need a friend He'll guide you
He'll be a friend to you


"God Will"
God will walk with me down the streets where no one else will walk
God will talk with me of things that no one else will talk
When no one else will walk and no one else will talk
When no one will, God will
God will share with me the little worries no one knows are there
God will care for me whenever there is no one else to care
When no one will be there and no one else will share
When no one will, God will
God will think of me when friends forget and fail to understand
God will strengthen me when I am weak and need a helping hand
When no one understands or lends a helping hand
When no one will, God will, when no one will, God will

Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me
A rose, a carnation, the lily and an orchid make such a pretty bouquet
(Drink to me, drink to me)
But only the orchid was worthy of you, so I threw all the others away
(Drink to me, drink to me)
Then you took the orchid and you breathed on its petals
And after a day or two
The flower still blooms but the scent's not the orchids
It carries the savor of you
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me
So if you're gonna drink to me, drink with your eyes
And I'll never cry for wine
(Drink to me, drink to me)
Or leave a kiss in an empty coffee cup then pass it from your lips to mine
(Drink to me, drink to me)
Cause I've got a thirst burning way down in my soul
And honey from a sugar tree
Is not half as sweet as the air that you breathe
Honey come here and drink to me
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me


"Five Feet High And Rising"
My mama always taught me that good things come from adversity if we put our faith in the Lord
We couldn't see much good in the flood waters when they
were causing us to have to leave home
But when the water went down, we found that it had washed a load of rich black bottom dirt across our land. The following year we had the best cotton crop we'd ever had
I remember hearing
How high's the water, mama
Two feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa
Two feet high and risin'
We can make it to the road in a homemade boat
That's the only thing we got left that'll float
It's already over all the wheat and the oats
Two feet high and risin'
How high's the water, mama
Three feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa
Three feet high and risin'
Well, the hives are gone
I've lost my bees
The chickens are sleepin'
In the willow trees
Cow's in water up past her knees
Three feet high and risin'
How high's the water, mama
Four feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa
Four feet high and risin'
Hey, come look through the window pane
The bus is comin', gonna take us to the train
Looks like we'll be blessed with a little more rain
4 feet high and risin'
How high's the water, mama
Five feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa
Five feet high and risin'
Well, the rails are washed out north of town
We gotta head for higher ground
We can't come back till the water comes down
Five feet high and risin'
Well, it's five feet high and risin'


"The Man On The Hill"
Will we get cold and hungry
Will times be very bad
When we're needin' bread and meat
Where we gonna get it, Dad
We'll get it from the man
In the house on the hill
Yes we will from the man on the hill
Ploughin' time is over
Still the fields are bare
How we gonna make a livin'
With twenty acres to share
I'll beg for more land
From the man on the hill
Yes I will, I'll ask the man on the hill
I ain't got no Sunday shoes
That I can wear to town
Papa reckon the boss has got
A pair of hand
I'll go and ask the man
In the house on the hill
Yes I will, I'll ask the man on the hill
Maybe he will help us
Maybe we'll get by
But who's gonna pay the dyin' bills
If we all should die
We'll leave it to the man
In the sky when we die
Yes we'll leave it to the man in the sky


"Hank And Joe And Me"
In the desert where we searched for gold
The days're hot the nights're cold
Hank and Joe and me walked on
So bold and brave and free
For days and days we fought the heat
I got so thirsty and I got so weak
And when I fell 'cause I couldn't go
I heard Hank say to Joe
He's dyin'
(Dyin' dyin')
For water
Hear him cryin'
(Cryin' cryin')
For water
Well lay him down in the dust and sand he said
Joe you know he's a dyin' man
Leave him there and let him die
I can't stand to hear him cry for water
I don't remember how long I lay
But when I awoke it was the break of day
Buzzards circled miles ahead
I knew Hank and Joe were dead
My eyes were dimmed but I could see
A bed of gold nuggets under me
Now I know that it won't be long
Till they decorate my bones
Cause I'm dyin'
(Dyin' dyin')
For water
Can't help cryin'
(Cryin' cryin')
For water
Well they laid me down in the dust and sand he said
Joe you know he's a dyin' man
Leave him there and let him die
I can't stand to hear him cry for water
He couldn't stand to hear me cry for water


"Clementine"
(Oh my darlin' Clementine)
She knew that Cody was the man she wanted
But she had waited nearly all her life
Just one more trip to town to tell the boys goodbye
Then he'd be back to take her for his wife
(Don't you worry)
Clementine
Cody saddled up and left his darlin'
Then rode to town to celebrate his plan
He told 'em this would be his last carousing'
I'm gonna settle down boys if I can
(With my darlin')
Clementine
Someone said
It must have been past midnight
When Cody had to face a jealous man
Another story goes that no one really knows
But it seems there was a dance hall girl called Nan
(Don't you tell)
Clementine
We do know that the shot or two was heard from some back room
Then there was a silence in the place
Just one more trip to town but all his chips were down
They found Cody lyin' on his face
(Softly callin')
Clementine
So buddies, make a monument to lay down at his head
Sure you hate to leave your pal behind
Mother, help your daughter put her weddin' dress away
Cause Cody won't be ridin' back this time
(To his darlin')
Clementine


"Don't Step On Mother's Roses"
We all were called to come back
To the old home on the farm
Mother's passed away, what a mournful day
And as my daddy watched
His eyes were filled with pain and hurt
When someone stepped upon a rose
And crushed it in the dirt
Don't step on Mother's roses
Daddy cried
She planted them the day she was my bride
And every time I see a rose, I see her smilin' face
She made my darkest days look bright
Round the old home place
Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow
The way they did since many years ago
They'll bloom for me each year
And I'll have Mother near
Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow
Years have passed away
And how the old home place has changed
Daddy had to go, we all miss him so
Children pick the roses as they go along the way
But when their petals are abused, I hear my daddy say
Don't step on Mother's roses
Daddy cried
She planted them the day she was my bride
And every time I see a rose, I see her smilin' face
She made my darkest days look bright
Round the old home place
Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow
The way they did since many years ago
They'll bloom for me each year
And I'll have Mother near
Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow


"Great Speckled Bird"
What a beautiful thought I am thinking
Concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word
All the other birds are flocking 'round her
And she is despised by the squad
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great church of God
All the other churches are against her
They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name
Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake
She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky
In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is o'er
I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look
When He cometh descending from heaven
On the cloud that He writes in His Word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of that great speckled bird


"I Want To Go Home"
We sailed on the ship John B, my grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night, got into a fight
Well, I feel so homesick I wanna go home
So hoist up the John B sail, see how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home
Well, I feel so homesick I wanna go home
The first mate, he got drunk, broke up the people's trunk
Constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone, why don't you leave me alone
Well, I feel so homesick I wanna go home
Then the cook, he caught the fits, threw out all of my grits
Then he took and ate up all of my corn
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home
Well, this is the worst trip since I have been born
So hoist up the John B sail, see how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home
Well, I feel so homesick I wanna go home


"The Caretaker"
I live in the cemetery
Old Caretaker' they call me
In the wintertime I rake the leaves
And in the summer I cut the weeds
When a funeral comes
The people cry and pray
They bury their dead
Then they all go away
And here I work
And I somehow hide
From a world that rushes
By outside
But each night
When I rest my head
I'm contented
As the peaceful death
But who's gonna cry
When old John dies
Who's gonna cry
When old John dies
Once I was a young man
Dashing with the girls
Now no one wants an old man
When I lost my handsome curls
But I wanna say
When my time comes
Lay me facin'
The rising sun
Put me in a corner
Where I buried my pup
Tell the preacher to pray
Then cover me up
Don't lay flowers
Where my head should be
Maybe God would
Let some grow for me
And all the little children
That I love like my own
Will they be sorry
That Old John's gone
Who's gonna cry
When Old John dies
Who's gonna cry
When Old John dies


"Old Apache Squaw"
Old Apache Squaw, how many long lean years you saw
How many bitter winter nights shiverin' in a cold teepee
Shiverin' in a cold teepee
Old Apache Squaw, how many hungry kids you saw
How many bloody warriors runnin' to the sea, fleein' to the sea
Well, now they tell me that you saw Cochise
When he made his last stand
He said
The next white man that sees my face
Is gonna be a dead white man
Old Apache Squaw, how many broken hearts you saw
Have you had misty eyes for years
Could that mist be tears
Well, now they tell me that you saw Cochise
When he made his last stand
He said
The next white man that sees my face
Is gonna be a dead white man
Old Apache Squaw, how many broken hearts you saw
You've had misty eyes for years
Could that mist be tears
Old Apache Squaw


"My Grandfather's Clock"
My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died
Ninety years without slumbering
tik,tlk,tik,tok
His life seconds numbering
tik,tok,tik,tok
It stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died
My grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound
And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died
It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come
Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died
Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died


"It Could Be You (Instead Of Him)"
If you should meet some lonely soul
Who on this earth can't reach his gold
And he's travelin' down the road so dark and dim
Lend the hand, say a prayer
Give a smile that he might share
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him)
Befriend each stranger in the night
Help to make his burdens light
Lift up the fallin' ones and be a friend
(Be a friend)
Shed a tear, share a sight
Share his fears don't pass him by
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(It could be you instead of him)
Shed a tear, share a sigh
Share his fears don't pass him by
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(It could be you instead of him)


"I Got Stripes"
On A Monday I Was Ar
On A Tuesday They Locked Me In The Jail (Oh Boy)
On A Wednesday My Trial Was At
On A Thursday They Said Guilty And The Judge's Gavel Fell
I Got Stripes
I Got Chains
I Got Stripes
And Them Chains
On A Monday My Momma Come To See Me
On A Tuesday They Caught Me With A File
On A Wednesday I'm Down In Solitary
On A Thursday I Start On Bread And Water For A While
I Got Stripes
I Got Chains
I Got Stripes
And Them Chains
I Got Stripes
I Got Chains
I Got Stripes
And Them Chains


"You Dreamer You"
I dreamed I walked in a field of flowers
Oh, what a dream
The houses all were silver towers
Oh, what a dream
Beside the road an angel sat
I said hello and tipped my hat
And stopped when I saw her smile
And set me down a while
I set me down a while
You dreamer you
I tried the angel for a kiss
Oh, what a dream
But she turned away and my lips missed
Oh, what a dream
She said
Sir, I'll have you know
I met you just a while ago
You're welcome for to sit
But calm yourself a bit, sir
Calm yourself a bit
You dreamer you
I fell in love like one, two, three
Oh, what a dream
I asked the angel to marry me
Oh, what a dream
She said
Sir, I can't marry you
But I'm a dream that can come true
There are dreams of much my worth
That live upon the earth, sir
Live upon the earth
You dreamer you
Then I awoke and found my love
Oh, what a dream
As heavenly as the one above
Oh, what a dream
We'll marry in a sea of flowers
Home will be a silver tower
There'll be heaven in my life
With an angel for a wife
With an angel for a wife
You dreamer you
You dreamer you


"Loading Coal"
My pappy said when I was seventeen you're six feet tall and your face is clean
And it don't look right for a boy that old to not make a livin' loadin' coal
Loadin' coal loadin' coal I'm a double first cousin to a dad blamed mole
Never get rich for to save my soul and forty 'leven years a loadin' coal loadin' coal
Ain't never got acquainted with a dollar bill and I don't ever reckon that I ever will
A dollar ain't made for a fellar I'm told that scoops up a livin' loadin' coal
Loadin' coal loadin' coal
I cussed everything in the mining camp from a shovel and my pick to my carbide lamp
But I know mighty well till I grow old I'll still be a cussin' but loadin' coal
Loadin' coal loadin' coal
I know just as well as coal is black one of these days the mines were strike
And I'll sit around starvin' till I'm finally told
There's a nickel more a ton for loadin' coal
Loadin' coal loadin' coal


"Slow Rider"
I ride an old paint he's on the worry side
And I'm a saddle tramp about to cross the great divide
Where there's grass in the coolies and water in the drawl
And the forty pound saddle won't make us both raw
Slow rider, slow rider move on a little more
The sky boss is waitin' at the big ranch house door
I can't help but missin' the daughters that I had
One went to Denver the other went bad
My young wife died in a poolroom fight
But I try to keep singin' from morning till night
Slow rider, slow rider move on a little more
The sky boss is waitin' at the big ranch house door
Whenever I die take my saddle from the wall
Strap it on snuffy lead him out of the stall
Throw me on his back and turn him toward the west
He knows how to take me to the spot I love best
Slow rider, slow rider move on a little more
The sky boss is waitin' at the big ranch house door


"Lumberjack"
I lived on a farm out in Iowa
I pulled the corn and I worked in the hay
Got trapped by a girl but I wiggled free
Heard the Oregon timber callin' me
Will you tell me somethin', Mr lumberjack
Is it one for forward and three for back
Is it two for stop or four for go
Boy, ask a whistle punk I don't know
Well, I learned this fact from a logger named Ray
You don't cut timber on a windy day
Stay out of the woods when the moisture's low
Or you ain't gonna live to collect your dough
Will you tell me somethin', Mr lumberjack
Is it one for forward and three for back
Is it two for stop or four for go
Boy, ask a whistle punk I don't know
Well you work in the woods from morning to night
You laugh and sing and you cuss and fight
On Saturday night you go to Eugene
And on a Sunday morning your pockets are clean
Will you tell me somethin', Mr lumberjack
Is it one for forward and three for back
Is it two for stop or four for go
Boy, ask a whistle punk I don't know


"Dorraine Of Ponchartrain"
As I walked by the lake one day by chance my Dorraine passed my way
Then she and I walked hand in hand on the banks of Ponchartrain
I pinned a flower on her heart, I swore we'd never be apart
She vowed her love forever and as I kissed her did the same
Dorraine, my Dorraine, my dark haired little angel
My belle of Ponchartrain
We sat down on the dock and with our hearts and fingers locked
We laughed and talked and joked about when our names are the same
And joking I said honey are you marrying me for money
And it took just one quick look to tell it hurt my dear Dorraine
She jumped and stood above me and she cried why you don't love me
I'm rowing home across the lake you won't see me again
I called and called some more but she rowed fast from the shore
And the clouds brought by a wind began to rain on Ponchartrain
Dorraine, I called Dorraine
Come back my little angel my belle of Ponchartrain
The storm should make her learn that she should make a swift return
But as the rain fell harder I lost sight of my Dorraine
As panic gripped my heart I drew the oars and made my start
To look for her on raging waters and the rain on Ponchartrain
At darkness I still called but no one heard my cries at all
And when the daybreak came then others helped me look for my Dorraine
But there was not a thing afloat except the oars from her rowboat
For all was lost upon the choppy waves and rain on Ponchartrain
Now I come day after day to where my sweetheart rowed away
And I gaze across the water of the rainy Ponchartrain
Just one thing and nothing more ever floated back to shore
Was this flower I hold it is the one I pinned on my Dorraine
Dorraine, my Dorraine, my dark haired little angel
My belle of Ponchartrain


"Going To Memphis"
Bring a drink of water Leroy
Bring a drink of water, no
If I could get to the mercy man
He'd give me some I know
I got a gal in Vicksburg
Bertha is her name
Wish I's tied to Bertha
Instead of this ball and chain
I'm goin' to Memphis, that's right Lord, yeah
A dude took all my money
Wouldn't let me see the cards
I owe the boss about a hundred years
For sleepin' in his backyard
I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah Memphis
Yeah I'm goin' to Memphis
Like a bitter weed, I'm a bad seed
But when that levee's through and I am too
Let the honky tonk roll on
Come mornin' I'll be gone
I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah Memphis
I never been to Chicago
But it must be a mighty fine place, that's right
I couldn't get past Tennessee
With Mississippi all over my face
I'm goin' to Memphis, that's right Lord, Memphis
Well, the freezin' ground at night
Is my own foldin' bed
Pork salad is my bread and meat
And it will be till I'm dead
Well, I brought me a little water
In a Mr. Prince Albert can
But the boss man caught me drinkin' it
And I believe, he broke my hand
They all call me crazy for sassin' Mr. Scott
My brother was killed for a deed I did
But I dis remember what, yeah
Well another boy is down
The shovel burned him out
Let me stand on his body
To see what the shoutin's about
I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah I'm goin' to Memphis
Like a bitter weed, I'm a bad seed
But when that levee's through and I am too
Let the honky tonk roll on
Come mornin' I'll be gone
I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah Memphis


"When Papa Played The Dobro"
My papa was a hobo when they delivered me
We didn't have a doctor cause he couldn't pay the fee
But when the goin' got too bad to ease his misery
Papa played the dobro this a way and he'd go
When company would come around he kept the dobro hid
He knew he couldn't play the way the other players did
Why the guitar's resonator was a gallon bucket lid
But papa played the dobro this a way and he'd go
Well now that papa's gone away it's hanging by the flue
The top of it's rusted and the strings're rusty too
It won't ever sound the way that it did when it was new
When papa played the dobro this a way and he'd go


"Boss Jack"
Pick a lot o'cotton, drag a long sack
Comin' across the field, well, I see Boss Jack
He's a ridin' straddle of a single foot roan
When you know that horse, you'll leave him alone
The ole roan's got green in his eyes
Mean as the devil and twice as wise
A fire in his nose and a bow in his back
Can't nobody ride him but Boss Jack
Come on children, bend your back
Work a little faster, fill your sack
Then you hitch up the wagon, take it to the gin
Finish pickin' before the winter sets in
Now here while back, when the crop was laid by
Remember who took us on a big fish fry
Caught a heap of catfish, goggle eye and carp
Dashed and sang to the guitar and the harp
Well, someday old Boss Jack is gonna set us all free
Gabriel gonna blow for you and me
Angels gonna bring that chariot from above floppin'
Their wings like a turtle dove, come on children


"Old Doc Brown"
He was just an old country doctor in a little country town
Fame and fortune had passed him by though we never saw him frown
As day by day in his kindly way he'd serve us one and all
Many a patient forgot to pay although Doc's fees were small
Though he needed his dimes and there were times that he'd receive a fee
He'd pass it onto some poor soul that needed it worse than he
He had to sell his furniture couldn't pay his office rent
So to a dusty room over a livery stable Doc Brown and his satchel went
And on the hitchin' post at the kerb below to advertise his wares
He nailed a little sign that read Doc Brown has moved upstairs
There he kept on helping folks get well,for his heart was jus'pure gold
But anyone with eyes could see that Doc was gettin' old
Then one day he didn't answer when they knocked upon his door
Old Doc Brown was layin' down but his soul was no more
They found him there in that old black suit on his face was a smile of content
But all the money they could find on him was a quarter and a copper cent
So they opened up his ledger and what they saw gave their hearts a pull
Beside each debtor's name old Doc had write these words Paid In Full
Old Doc should had a funeral fine enough for a king
It's a ghastly joke our town was broke and no one could give a thing
Cept Jones an undertaker he did mighty well
Donatin' an old iron casket he had never been able to sell
And the funeral procession it wasn't much for grace and pomp and the style
But those wagon loads of mourners they stretched out for more than a mile
We wanted to give him a monument we kinda figured we owed him one
Cause he made our town a better place for all the good he'd done
We pulled up that old hitchin' post where Doc had nailed a sign
We'd painted it white and to all of us it certainly did look fine
Now the rains and the snows have washed away our white trimmin's of paint
There ain't nothin' left but Doc's own sign and that's gettin' pretty faint
But you can still see that old hitchin' post as if in answer to our prayers
Mutely tellin' the whole wide world Doc Brown has moved upstairs


"The Fable Of Willie Brown"
Well I knew a boy named Willie Brown
He was A lover of our town
Wherever he went the girls fell down
And cryed for Willie Brown
Crazy about Willie Brown
Tall and dark and lean and long
Big as a bull and twice as strong
He loved the girls and turned them down
A sheek was Willie Brown
Dang sheek Willie Brown
Well a new girl moved in on our street
We knew that she and Will would meet
But when we inquired around she had not met Willie Brown
She said who's Willie Brown
The prettiest girl you ever saw head to
Toe without A flaw
When we met one night in town she fell for
Willie Brown, In love with Willie Brown
But the trouble was that
We all knew Willie Brown was falling too
Then He announced
When June comes around
She'll marry Willie Brown
She's in love
With Willie Brown
But then the girl denied it all,she said
Its true that I did fall but he took my love for granted now
To heck with Willie Brown, conceided Willie Brown
Willie Brown was shocked to learn that his love had at last been spearned
So on a Hill ouside of town we buried Willie Brown, we buried Willie Brown


"Second Honeymoon"
I walked up to the desk and asked the man about a room
I asked about the bridal suite, I told him I'm the groom
Then I took the elevator to the floor I was assigned
I fumbled with the key the way I did that other time
Inside I thought of all the things that started in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon
I hear the happy people laughing in the street below
But the loneliness I feel tonight I hope you never know
The life that was a happy song has ended much too soon
And I'm alone on our second honeymoon
I look around the room and see you standing everywhere
The fragrance of your bridal flowers seems to fill the air
The blushing bride that gave me such a free and eager kiss
Two loving arms around me as you offered wedded bliss
We'd said that we'd return to live it over in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon
More Of Old Golden Throat


"Ballad Of The Harp Weaver"
Son said my mother when I was knee high
You need of clothes to cover you and not a rag have I
There's nothing in the house to make a boy's britches
Nor shears to cut a cloth with nor thread to take stitches
There's nothing in the house but a leaf end of rye
And the harp with a with the woman's head nobody will by and she began to cry
That was in the early fall and when came the late fall
Son she said the sight of you makes your mother's blood crawl
Little skinny shoulder blades stickin' through your clothes
And where you get a jacket from God above knows
It's lucky for me lad your daddy's in the ground
And can't see the way I let his son go around and she made a queer sound
That was in the late fall when the winter came
I'd not a pair of bridges nor a shirt to my name
I couldn't go to school or out of doors to play
And all the other little boys passed our way
Son said my mother come climb into my lap
And I'll chave your little knees while you take a nap
And oh but we were silly for half an hour or more
Me with my long legs draggin' on the floor
I rocked rocked rocked to a mother goose rhyme
Oh but we were happy for half an hour's time
But there was I a great boy and what would folks say
To hear my mother singin' me to sleep all day in such a daft way
Men say the winter was bad that year fuel was scarce and food was dear
A wind with a wolf's head howled about our door
And we burned up the chairs and sat upon the floor
All that was left us was a chair we couldn't break
And the harp with the woman's head nobody would take for song or pity sake
The night before Christmas I cried with the cold
I cried myself to sleep like a two year old
And in the deep night I felt my mother rise
And stare down upon me with love in her eyes
I saw my mother sitting on the one good chair
A light falling on her face from I couldn't tell where
Looking nineteen and not a day older
And the harp with the woman's head leaned against her shoulder
Her thin fingers moving in the thin tall strings
Were weave weave weaving wonderful things
Many bright threads from where I couldn't see
Were running through the harp strings rapidly
And gold threads whistlin' through my mother's hands
I saw the web grow and the pattern expand
She wove a child's jacket and when it was done
She laid it on the floor and wove another one
She wove a red cloak so regal to see
She's made it for a king's son I said and not for me but I knew it was for me
She wove a pair of bridges and quicker than that
She wove a pair of boots a little cocked hat
She wove a pair of mittens she wove a little blouse
She wove all night in the still cold house
She sang as she worked and the harp strings spoke
But her voice never faltered and the thread never broke
But when I awoke there sat my mother
With the harp against her shoulder lookin' nineteen and not a day older
A smile about her lips and a light about her head
And her hands in the harp strings frozen dead
And piled up beside her toppling to the skies
Were the clothes of a king's son just my size
The Christmas Spirit


"Smiling Bill Mccall"
Well, the whole town listened to the radio
For the Smiling Bill McCall Show
Everyone in Nashville
Was listenin' to Bill
I don't want to be layin' in bed
When they pronounce me dead
He'd stand and breathe in the microphone
With his guitar hangin' to his knee bone
All the girls just sat and dreamed
When Bill began his sing
I don't want my hat to be hung
When my last song is sung
But he never let fame go to his head
This is Smiling Bill McCall
he said
Gonna pick and sing a song or two
You all listen till I'm through
And if you're at the house or in your car
Tune in this time tomorrow
To all the boys he was a big hero
They'd glue their ears to the radio
Then talkin' a most unusual drawl
Imitatin' Bill McCall
Daddy, can I get me a guitar
Cause I want to be a star
The girls would say of Bill McCall
Why I bet he's over six feet tall
Handsomest man in Nashville
They said of Smiling Bill
He won't be plantin' potato slips
When he cashes in his chips
Then one day Bill didn't make the show
Didn't even show up for a week or so
The station's boss said to city hall
Find Smiling Bill McCall
It won't be hard to track him down
He's got the biggest feet in town
Well, there's a creek that runs through Nashville
And on the bank they found Smiling Bill
He's committin' suicide
But they grabbed him before he tried
Turn me loose, I want to jump
he screamed
Cause I can't stand that theme
Let this be my final breath
Cause I'm scared to half to death
The big brave Smiling Bill McCall
Is only four feet tall
I'd rather be in the river dead
Than to hear 'em laughin' at my bald head


"Seasons Of My Heart"
The seasons come the seasons go
We get a little sunshine, rain and snow
Just the way that it was planned to be
But there's no seasons in my heart
While you play the leading part
Cause the flowers will bloom eternally
Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow
And my tears like withered leaves will fall
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow
And, darling, we could be happy after all
As it is in nature's plan
No season get the upper hand
How I try to keep this fact in mind
The trees are bare the cold wind blows
And by experience we should know
Winter comes but the spring is close behind
Your leaving will bring


"I Feel Better All Over"
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere else baby
When I'm out with you
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere else
When you kiss me like you do
Well, I am as wild as a buck everytime you cause me up
You sure makes me feel like a wheel
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere else
That's exactly how I feel
Oh, I feel better all over more than anywhere else
When you whisper sweet nothings in my ear
Oh, I feel better all over more than anywhere else, honey
Anytime that you're near
Well, my heart beats double time when you hold your hand in mine
You sure is a wonderful deal
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere else
That's exactly how I feel
Oh, that's exactly how I feel


"I Couldn't Keep From Crying"
I saw you walking by his side
Heard you whisper all those lies and I
Couldn't keep from crying
You sang him love songs tenderly
Just the way you sang to me me and I
Couldn't keep from crying
I saw you capture all his charms
While he held you in his arms
With his pretty words and ways
In your heart, he took my place
I stood and watched him steal a kiss
From two lips, I know I'll miss and I
Couldn't keep from crying
I saw you capture all his charms
While he held you in his arms
With his pretty words and ways
In your heart, he took my place
I stood and watched him steal a kiss
From two lips, I know I'll miss and I
Couldn't keep from crying


"Time Changes Everything"
Time has passed I've forgotten mother nature does wonderful things
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything
You can change the name of an old song rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything
Goodbye goodluck may God bless you Idon't say I won't love again
I guess that it's true for me and for you that time changes everything


"My Shoes Keep Walking Back To You"
I may say that I don't care, hold my up head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through my heartaches start anew
And that's when I miss you most of all
And my arms keep reaching for you
My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you
No matter how much I pretend I wish I had you back again
Cause nothing else means half as much as you
My world just seemed to die the day you left my side
And I can't forget no matter what I do
And my arms keep reaching for you
My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you


"I'd Just Be Fool Enough (To Fall)"
Oh please don't be so careless with your glances
Don't look at me that way and breathe a sigh
Please don't get too close and let me love you
Cause I just might be fool enough to try
It's not that I don't think I'm worthy of you
But memories from the past I still recall
Please don't get too close and let me love you
Cause I just might be fool enough to fall
It's not that I don't think I'm worthy of you
But memories from the past I still recall
Oh, please don't get too close and let me love you
Cause I just might be fool enough to fall


"Transfusion Blues"
Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds
Took a transfusion and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' 44 beneath my head
Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a transfusion and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico
Late in the hot joints takin' the pills
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said
Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down
Said
Yes, oh yes my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant just a read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
Put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that country jail
Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commenced to look about
In about five minutes in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
Verdict read in the first degree
I hollered
Lowdy, Lowdy have a mercy on me
The judge he smiled as he picked up his been
Ninety
Ninety
I can't forget the day I shot my woman down
Come on you guys and listen unto me
Lay off that liquor and let that transfusion be


"Why Do You Punish Me (For Loving You)"
Why do you punish me for loving you
You're counting my mistakes, how about yours
Why do you sentence me, too nice of tears
Convicting all these dreams, I've dreamed for all these years
My heart cries out behind these prison bars
It pleads to you for your true love to set it free
Why do you punish me is love a crime
If so I'll spend the lifetime, loving, serving time
My heart cries out behind these prison bars
It pleads to you for your true love to set it free
Why do you punish me is love a crime
If so I'll spend the lifetime, loving, serving time


"I Will Miss You When You Go"
I will miss you when you go much more than you'll ever know
But I'll have a memory to keep you near
In my heart you will remain but it just won't be the same
I will miss a million things that make you dear
Your lovely ways make you so sweet I prayed the angels fair will keep
You're happiness so you'll be blessed just as you deserve to be
I wonder why there are so few lovely people like you
My but I will surely miss you when you go
Your lovely ways make you


"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide its face and cry
Did you ever see a Robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That means he's lost his will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry
[Instrumental break]
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I'm so lonesome I could cry
American IV: The Man Comes Around


"Just One More"
Put the bottle on the table
Let it stay there till I'm not able
To see your face in every place that I go
I've been sitting here so long
Just remembering that you are gone
One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
One drink just one more and then another
I'll keep drinking it won't matter
I'll just remember that I once had her
I don't know why, I sat and cry every day
I've been trying to forget
But I haven't stopped as yet
One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
One drink just one more and then another
Put the bottle on the table
Let it stay there till I'm not able
To see your face in every place that I go
I've been sitting here so long
Just remembering that you are gone
One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
One drink just one more and then another


"Honky Tonk Girl"
Don't be fool by big blue eyes by a smile or a golden curl
Cause she'll love you now and then break every vow
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl
Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one
She knows all the arts of love she'll give your heart a twirl
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl
She can never change your ways though you'll give her all the world
She's had more than one or two and each day there's someone new
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl
Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one
She knows all the arts of love she'll give your heart a twirl
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl


"Sugartime"
Well now sugar in the morning sugar in the evening sugar at suppertime
Be my little sugar and love me all the time
Honey in the morning honey in the evening honey at suppertime
Be my little honey and love me all the time
Put your arms around me swear by stars above
You'll be mine forever in the heaven of love
Sugar in the morning sugar in the evening sugar at suppertime
Be my little sugar and love me all the time
Now sugar time is anytime that you're near oh you're so dear
Now don't you roam just be my honeycomb and live in a heaven of love
Well sugar in the morning


"Down The Street To 301"
There's a boy across the street lately he's looked very neat
Seems he's always on the run down the street to 301
(Seems he's always on the run down the street to 301)
Saturday he mows the lawn it's about a crack of dawn
Nine o'clock the work's all done down the street to 301
(Nine o'clock the work's all done down the street to 301)
When it's back to school this fall winter's chill may end it all
But for now there's lots of fun with the girl at 301
(But for now there's lots of fun with the girl at 301)
Maybe they will never wed sure they may break up instead
But for now she is the one the girl who lives at 301
(But for now she is the one the girl who lives at 301)
The boy who lives across the street has a reason to be neat
He's in love and on the run with the girl at 301
(He's in love and on the run with the girl at 301)
Don't you tell 'em to beware of a summer love affair
You know she is only one the girl that live at 301
(You know she is only one the girl that live at 301)


"Life Goes On"
My baby left me just the other day
I guess the things will never be the same
But I must forget that she is gone
Cause time goes by and life goes on
Making plans, shaking hands
Try to prove that I'm a man
It's hard to do but I must try
Cause life goes on and so will I
It's been kinda tough these last few days
Trying to act normal and be gay
It's not easy to be all alone
But time goes by and life goes on
If I see her anywhere
I hope she thinks that I don't care
For after night there comes the dawn
Yes time goes by and life goes on


"Port Of Lonely Hearts"
A ship came in, but it was empty
And then it sailed back out to sea again
Now there's the sail on the horizon
And now I wait until your ship comes in
And I'll be waiting in the port of lonely hearts
Watchin' for your topsail on the sea
Prayin' that my ship of love will come
To the port of lonely hearts where I will be
I'll brave the storm until you're with me
Cause wind and rain can't change a love that's true
I'll be alone until you anchor and then
I'll leave this lonely port with you
Till then I'm waiting in the port of lonely hearts
Watchin' for your topsail on the sea
Prayin' that my ship of love will come
To the port of lonely hearts where I will be


"Cry, Cry, Cry"
Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down
I think you only live to see the lights uptown
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try
Cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry
Soon your sugar
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you
Bye, bye, bye
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own
You're gonna cry, cry, cry
I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry
When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me why, why, why
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been
You're gonna cry, cry, cry
Now Here's Johnny Cash


"My Treasure"
I saved a lot of money my fortune was untold
And like a fool I idealized my silver and my gold
My earthly treasure's mounted but when I counted through
I realized the treasure I had overlooked was you
My treasure unmeasured but forsaken of the treasures that come from above
My treasure unmeasured but it don't hold a heart of the one that I love
If I had my life before me if I could see it all
I'd stake my claim on things that are secured against downfall
I'd work for earthly treasures like any man would do
But I set my sights much higher and I'd be sure that I had you
My treasure unmeasured unmeasured


"Oh Lonesome Me"
Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set set me free oh lonesome me
A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
I thought of everything from A to Z oh lonesome me
I'll bet she's not like me she's out and fancy free
Flirtin' with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms
Well there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I thought of everything from A to Z oh lonesome me oh lonesome me
Well I'll bet she's not like me
Oh lonesome me


"Home Of The Blues"
Just around the corner there's heartache
Down the street that losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops
You'll find me at the Home of the Blues
I walk and cry while my heartbeat
Keeps time with the drag of my shoes
The sun never shines through this window of mine
It's dark at the Home of the Blues
Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest mem'ries
Mem'ries so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad
I just want to give up and lay down and die
So if you've just lost your sweetheart
And it seems there's no good way to choose
Come along with me, misery loves company
You're welcome at the Home of the Blues
Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest mem'ries
Mem'ries so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad
I just want to give up and lay down and die
So if you've just lost your sweetheart
And it seems there's no good way to choose
Come along with me, misery loves company
You're welcome at the Home of the Blues
You'll find me at the Home of the Blues
Yeah, you're gonna find me at the Home of the Blues


"So Doggone Lonesome"
I do my best to hide this lowdown feelin'
I try to make believe there's nothin' wrong
But they're always askin' me about you darlin'
And it hurts me so to tell 'em that you're gone
If they ask me, I guess, I'd be denyin'
That I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it cryin'
Where's my darlin' when's she comin' home
I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
Well I make it pretty good until that moon comes shinin' through
And that I get so doggone lonesome
Time stands still when you're a waitin'
Sometimes I think my heart is stoppin' too
One lonely hour seems forever
Sixty minutes more to wait for you
But I guess I'll keep waitin' till you're with me
Cause I believe that lovin' you is right
But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow
If I can't have you with me tonight
Well I know, I'll keep on loving you 'cause true love can't be killed
I ought to get you off of my mind but I guess I never will
I could have a dozen others but I know, I'd love you still
Cause I get so doggone lonesome
Now Here's Johnny Cash


"You're The Nearest Thing To Heaven"
I have sailed the peaceful waters of the ocean deep and blue
I held my breath and watched the western sunsets golden hue
I've flown above the mountain peaks and valleys wide and green
But you're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
You're the nearest thing to heaven yes you are
I have searched for happiness so long and far
But my search for love was through the day that I found you
Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven yes you are
I confess that I've been tempted by a luring magic charms
When the smile was flashed my way and stood before two open arms
But I turned and walked away because I love you like I do
You're the nearest thing to heaven darlin' you
You're the nearest thing to heaven
I have watched the silver raindrops fall to earth to cool the day
Watched the rainbow at twilight when the clouds had blown away
I love the pretty flowers but they cannot buy the worth
Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven on this earth
You're the nearest thing to heaven


"The Story Of A Broken Heart"
Hmm the story of a broken heart
Well the sprinftime is coming and the honeybees are humming
And I just saw a robin flying by
While your wedding bells are ringing my poor heart is singing
The story of a broken heart hmm the story of a broken heart
When the trees start to blooding the mem'ries start to flooding
And my heart takes a trip to yesterday
When we walked neath the moon an our love was in bloom
Now we're two lovers drifted apart hmm the story of a broken heart
Now the wedding invitation forced out to your relation
But you ask me to give the pride away
Although I can't show it I think that you'll know it
A story that's told from my heart hmm the story of a broken heart


"Hey Porter"
Hey porter
Would you tell me the time
How much longer will it be till we cross
that Mason Dixon Line
At daylight would ya tell that engineer
to slow it down
Or better still, just stop the train
Cause I wanna look around
Hey porter
What time did ya say
How much longer will it be till I can
see the light of day
When we hit Dixie will you tell that engineer
to ring his bell
And ask everybody that ain't asleep
to stand right up and yell
Hey porter
It's getting light outside
This old train is puffin' smoke
and I have to strain my eyes
But ask that engineer if he will
blow his whistle please
Cause I smell frost on cotton leaves
and I feel that Southern breeze
Hey porter
Please get my bags for me
I need nobody to tell me now
that we're in Tennessee
Go tell that engineer to make that
lonesome whistle scream
We're not so far from home
so take it easy on the steam
Hey porter
Please open up the door
When they stop the train I'm gonna get off first
Cause I can't wait no more
Tell that engineer I said thanks alot
and I didn't mind the fare
I'm gonna set my feet on Southern soil
and breathe that Southern air


"He'll Understand And Say Well Done"
Give, when you give Him the best of your service
Tellin' the world that the savior has come
Be not dismayed if man don't believe you
He'll understand and say
Well done
Oh, when I come to the end of my journey
Weary of life and the battle is won
Bearing the staff and the cross of redemption
He'll understand and say
Well done
He'll understand and say
Well done
Misunderstood the savior of sinners
Died on the cross, He was God's only Son
But He knew well that his Father in Heaven
Would understand and say
Well done
Oh, when I come to the end of my journey
Weary of life and the battle is won
Bearing the staff and the cross of redemption
He'll understand and say
Well done


"God Must Have My Fortune Laid Away"
God has my fortune laid away
Oh, the world is full of people with money just to burn
Affording all the things in life for which a man might yearn
Some can take life easy but I live from day by day
God has my fortune laid away
(Laid away)
I search for sunshine every day but there always comes the rain
The hope over my horizon was smoke without a flame
Pockets that stay empty, dreams that go astray
God has my fortune laid away
(God has my fortune laid away laid away, laid away)
Oh how often I have wondered why some things have to be
Some people live in riches while some live just like me
The more I try to work and save the more I have to pay
But God has my fortune laid away
(Laid away)
I search for sunshine every day but there always comes the rain
The hope over my horizon was smoke without a flame
Pockets that stay empty, dreams that go astray
God has my fortune laid away


"I Got Shoes"
I got shoes, you got shoes, all God's children got shoes
When I get to Heaven gonna put on my shoes
I'm gonna walk all over God's Heaven Heaven
Everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven
Ain't goin' there Heaven Heaven

Everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven
Ain't goin' there Heaven Heaven
Gonna shout all over God's Heaven

Going to fly all over, going to shout all over
Going play all over, gonna walk all over God's Heaven


"When I've Learned Enough To Die"
(When I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die old enough to die)
I've met the Master on my knees
I was tested I was tried
I've seen the God of heaven
Paint the fields and country side
I've been the husband of one wife
Heard my newborn baby cry
But when I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die old enough to die
I've always been a hard working man
No stopping place have I found
But when I'm tired I'm still inspired
At night when I lie down
I've learned to kinda like this earth
Some time I wonder why
Cause when I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die
Old enough to die
(When I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die old enough to die)
I've always been a hard working man
No stopping place have I found
But when I'm tired I'm still inspired
At night when I lie down
I've learned to kinda like this earth
Some time I wonder why
Cause when I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die
Old enough to die


"Let The Lower Lights Be Burning"
Brightly beams our Father's mercy from his lighthouse evermore
But to us he gives the keeping of the lights along the shore
Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save
Dark the night of sin has settled loud the angry billows roar
Eager eyes are watching longing for the lights along the shore
Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save
Trim your feeble lamp my brother, some poor sailor tempest tossed
Trying now to make the harbor in the darkness may be lost
Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save


"If We Never Meet Again"
Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey
And perhaps we'll never meet anymore
Til we gather in heaven's bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore
If we never meet again this side of heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven
By the river of life
Where the charming roses bloom forever
And where separation come no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore
Oh so often we are parted with sorrow
And action often quietens our pain
But we never shall sorrow in heaven
God be with you till we meet again


"When I Take My Vacation In Heaven"
There are those who are taking vacations
To the mountains the lakes and the sea
Where they rest from their cares and their troubles
What a wonderful time that must be
But it seems not my lot to be like them
I must toil through the heat and the cold
Seekin' out the lost sheep on a mountain
Bringing wanderers back to the fold
But when I take my vacation in Heaven
What a wonderful time that will be
Hearing concerts by the Heavenly chorus
And the face of my Saviour I'll see
Sitting down on the banks of the river
Neath the shade of the evergreen tree
There I'll rest from my burdens forever
Won't you take your vacation with me
Sitting down on the banks of the river
Under the shade of the evergreen tree
There I'll rest from my burdens forever
Won't you take your vacation with me


"Taller Than Trees"
On your knees you are taller than trees
You can look over heartaches and pain
When my faith is gone to my knees
I will go, growing stronger and taller than trees
One night it was a long time ago now
I knelt at my mother's knee
And she said
Son lift up your eyes to Him in the skies
And you'll grow like the mighty oaks
But you son, created in the image of God
Can become taller even taller than the tallest of trees
And this was the answer I felt
As down at her knees I knelt
On your knees you're taller than trees
You can look over all your heartaches
And son you can look over all of your pains
When my faith is gone to my knees
I will go, growing stronger and taller than trees


"I Won't Have To Cross Jordan Alone"
When I come to the river at the ending of day
When the last winds of sorrow have blown
There'll be somebody waiting to show me the way I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan alone Jesus died all my sins to atone
In the darkness I see he'll be waiting for me I won't have to cross Jordan alone
Often times I'm weary and troubled and sad
When it seems that my friends have all flon
There is one thought that cheers me and makes my heart glad
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan
Though the billows of trouble and sorrow may sweep
Christ the Saviour will care for his own
Till the end of my journey my soul he will keep and I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan


"When He Reached Down His Hand For Me"
(When he reached down his hand for me)
Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way I was wretched and vile as could be
But my Saviour in love gave me peace from above
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down his hand for me when he reached way down for me
I was lost and undone without my God or his son
When he reached down his hand for me
I was near to despair when he came to me there
And he showed me that I could be free
Then he lifted my feet gave me gladness complete
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down


"My God Is Real"
There are some things I may not know
There are some places I can't go
But I am sure of this one thing
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul
My God is real, real in my soul
My God is real for He has washed and made me whole
His love for me is like pure gold
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul
Some folks may doubt, some folks may scorn
Well, they can all go on, just leave me alone
But ask for me, I'll take God's part
My God is real for I can feel Him in my heart
My God is real, real in my soul
My God is real for He has washed and made me whole
His love for me is like pure gold
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul


"These Hands"
These hands aren't the hands of a gentleman
These hands are calloused and old
These hands raised a family, these hands built a home
Now these hands raised to praise the Lord
These hands won the heart of my loved one
And with hers they were never alone
If these hands filled their task then what more could you ask
For these fingers have worked to the bone
Now don't try to judge me by what you'd like me be
For my life hasn't been a success
Some people have power but still they grieve
While these hands brought me happiness
Now I'm tired and I'm old and I haven't much gold
Maybe things ain't been all that I planned
Lord above hear my plea when it's time to judge me
Take a look at these hard working hands
Take a look at these hard working hands


"Lost On The Desert"
A burnin' hot sun a cryin' for water black wings circle the sky
Stumblin' and fallin' somebody's callin' you're lost on the desert to die
I had to give up and they took me to jail but I hid all the money I got
Way out on the desert where no one could get it and I left a mark at the spot
Then I got away and I ran for the desert the devil had taken control
I needed water but he said I'd make it near the money is a big waterhole
A burnin' hot sun
Just up ahead is where I left my mark or it may be to the left or the right
I've been runnin' all day and they'll catch up tomorrow I've got to find it tonight
Then up jumped the devil and ran away laughin' he drank all the waterholes dry
He moved my mark till I'm running in circles and lost on the desert to die
A burnin' hot sun
(Lost on the desert to die) lost on the desert to die (lost on the desert to die)


"Accidentally On Purpose"
Accidentally I saw you this morning
You were lovely dressed in your wedding gown
And they say that you married a stranger to me
That had drifted to our old hometown
Accidentally you've met him one evening
And you say it was love at first sight
Accidentally on purpose you've married
Accidentally on purpose for spite
Cause I saw out cheatin' and runnin' around
And I was just a fool with a heart of a clown
Accidentally you were mistaken that night
Accidentally on purpose for spite
Cause I saw out cheatin'


"In The Jailhouse Now"
He's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice
To quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now
Well I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob
Who used to steal, gamble and rob
He thought he was the smartest guy in town
But I found out last Monday
That Bob got locked up Sunday
They got him in the jailhouse way down town
He's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice
To quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now
Well I went out last Tuesday
Met a girl named Susie
I told her I was the swellest man around
Well she started in to spend my money
She started in to call me honey
We took in every honky tonk in town
We're in the jailhouse now
We're in the jailhouse now
They told us once or twice
To quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
We're in the jailhouse now


"Mr. Lonesome"
I've got no fire inside of me can't be the man I try to be
Oh Mr Lonesome hanging round
Don't wanna see nobody don't wanna be nobody
Oh Mr Lonesome got me down
He makes me leave the party when folks are laughin' hearty
Happiness is one thing he can't stand
Nobody wants or needs me I go just where he leads me
Oh Mr Lonesome got my hand
And so my whole life over each day is like the other but still if my one wish could be
If that old chain that binds me breaks when true love finds me
And Mr Lonesome sets me free oh Mr Lonesome got me down


"You Won't Have Far To Go"
I can see now that you've stacked the cards so I leave you with my best regards
When you play to feel with nothing left to show look for me you won't have far to go
Love's a gamble and I'm a gamblin' man I've done everything to make you understand
But the odds are high and luck is running low look for me you won't have far to go
You won't have far to go if you want me cause I'm gonna stick close to you
And I'm not the kind to say I told you so look for me you won't have far to go
You won't have far to go


"In Them Old Cottonfields Back Home"
When I was a little bitty baby my mama would rock me in my cradle
In them old cottonfields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
Now when them cotton bolls get rotten you can't pick very much cotton
In them old cottonfields back home
It was down in Louisiana just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cottonfields back home

When I was a little bitty baby

"Delia's Gone"
Delia, oh, Delia Delia all my life
If I hadn't have shot poor
Delia I'd have had her for my wife
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
I went up to Memphis
And I met Delia there Found her in her parlor
And I tied to her chair
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
She was low down and trifling
And she was cold and mean
Kind of evil make me want to Grab my sub machine
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
First time I shot her I shot her in the side
Hard to watch her suffer
But with the second shot she died
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
But jailer, oh, jailer Jailer
I can't sleep 'Cause all around my bedside
I hear the patter of Delia's feet
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
So if you woman's devilish
You can let her run
Or you can bring her down and do her
Like Delia got done
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

"I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know"
You think you know the smile on her lips the thrill at the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss in each caress and each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You stole her love from me one day you didn't care how you've hurt me
But you can never steal away mem'ries of what used to be
You think she's yours to have and to hold
But someday you'll learn when her love grows cold
That I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You stole her love from me


"You Remembered Me"
You were young and needed love and I was wild and free
But every time you said a prayer you said a prayer for me
Why the ring upon your hand we vowed fidelity
There were times when I forgot but you remembered me
(There were times when I forgot but you remembered me)
You remembered only that wedding bells would ring
You remembered only to count the days till spring
You knew only love and honor but I couldn't see
I regret that I forgot cause you remembered me
(I regret that I forgot cause you remembered me)
I believed that promises were made to break apart
But every time I broke a vow I always broke your heart
So here's to you God bless you now wherever you may be
There were times that I forgot but you remembered me
(There were times that I forgot but you remembered me)
You remembered only that wedding bells would ring


"I'm Free From The Chain Gang Now"
I got rid of the shackles that bound me and the guards that were always around me
There were tears on the mail mother wrote me in jail
But I'm free from the chain gang now
All the years I was known and respected 'til one day I was wrongly suspected
I was shackled in chains in a cold freezin' rain but I'm free from the chain gang now
All the years I was known by a number how I kept my mind is a wonder
But like a bird in a tree I got my liberty and I'm free from the chain gang now
I got rid of the shackles that bound me and the guards that were always around me
There were tears on the mail mother sent me in jail
But I'm free from the chain gang now
There were tears on the mail mother wrote me in jail
But I'm free from the chain gang now

"Let Me Down Easy"

And maybe every year or so I'll drop a card to you
To tell you I'm still listening so sing it pretty Sue


"The Legend Of John Henry's Hammer"
John Henry's Papy woke him up one midnight
He said before the sheriff comes I wanna tell you, listen boy
Said learn to ball a jack, learn to lay  a track, learn to pick and shovel too, and take my hammer, it'll do anything you tell it to
John Hery's mammie had about a dozen babies, John Henry's papie told tale about a dozen times
The babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money, he said I'll pay you quarter at a time, startin' tomorow, that's the pay for a steel driver on this line
Then the section foreman said hey hammer swinger, I see you brought your own hammer boy, but what else can all those muscles do
And he said, I can turn a jack, I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too
(can you swing a hammer boy
I can I'll do anything you hire me to
Now ain't you something so high and mighty with your muscles, just go ahead pick up that hammer, pick up the hammer
He said get a rusty spike and swing it down three times, I'll pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to, go on and do what you say you can do
With a steep nose hammer on a four foot switch panel, John Henry raised it back till it touched his heels, then the spike went through the cross tie and it split it half in two, 35 cents a day for driven steel
(sweat sweat boy, sweat, you owe me two more swings)
I was born for driven steel
Well John Henry hammered in the mountain, he'd give a grunt and he'd give groan with every swing, the women folks for miles around, heard him and come down, to watch him make the cold steel ring, Lord what a swinger, just listen to that cold steel ring
But the bad boss come up laughing at John Henry, said you full of vinegar now, but you bout through, were gonna get a steam drill to do your share of drivin, then what's all them muscles gonna do, huh John Henry, gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you
John Henry said I feed four little brothers, and  my baby sister's walking on her knees, did the Lord say that machines awtta take the place of living, and what's a subsitute for bread and beans, I ain't seen it, do engines get rewarded for their steam
John Henry hid in a coal mine for his dinner now, had thirty minutes to rest before the bell, the mine boss hollered get up whoever you are and get a pick ax, give me enough coal to start another hill, and keep it burning, mine me enough to start another hill
John Henry said to his captain, a man ain't nothin but a man, but if you bring that steam drill round, I'll beat it fair and honest, I'll die with my hammer in my hand, but I'll be laughing, cuz you can't replace a steel driven man
There was a big crowd of people at the mountain, John Henry said to the steam drill how is you, pardon me mister steam drill, I suppose you didn't hear me, I said how you, well can you turn a jack, can you lay a track, can you pick and shovel too, listen this hammer swingers talkin' to you
2000 people hollered go John Henry, then somebody hollered the mountain's caving in, John Henry told the captain, tell the kind folks not to worry, that ain't nothin but my hammer suckin' wind, keeps me breathing, a steel drivers muscle I intend
Captain tell the people move back further, I'm at the finish line and I ain't no drill, she's so far behind you ain't got the brains to quit it, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills, Lord Lordy, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills
Well John Henry had a little woman, I believe the lady's name was Polly Ann, yeah that was his good woman, John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home, he layed down to rest his weary back and early next morining he said come here Polly Ann come here sugar, ya know I believe this is the first time I ever watched the sun come up that I couldn't come up with it
Take my hammer Polly Ann and go to that rail road, swing that hammer like you seen me do it, and when your swinging with the lead men, they'll all know they'll all know your John Henry's woman, but tell them that's not all I can do, tell em I can hoist a jack, and I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too, aint no machine can, that's been proved to you
There was a big crowd of mourners at the church house, the section hands laid him in the sand, trains go by on the rails John Henry laid, they slow down and take off their hats, the men do, when they come to the palce John Henrys laid, rests on his back, some say mornin steel driver you sure were a hammer swinger, then they go along pickin up speed, clikty clak, clikty clak, down there lies a steel driven man oh Lord, down there lies a steel driven man, down there lies a steel driven man oh Lord, down there lies a steel driven man

"Busted"
My bills are all due and the babies need shoes
But I'm Busted
Cotton's gone down to a quarter a pound
And I'm Busted
I got a cow that's gone dry
And a hen that won't lay
A big stack of bills
Getting bigger each day
The county's gonna haul my belongings away
But I'm Busted
So I called on my brother to ask for a loan
Cause I was Busted
I hate to beg like a dog for a bone
But I'm Busted
My brother said
there's not a thing I can do
My wife and my kids
Are all down with the flu
And I was just thinkin' about callin' on you
Cause I'M Busted
Lord, I ain't no thief, but a man can go wrong
When he's Busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone
But I'm Busted
Now the fields are all bare
And the cotton won't grow
Me and my family's gotta pack up and go
But I'll make a living, just where, I don't know
Cause I'm Busted


"Casey Jones"
Come all you rounders if you wanna hear the story about a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the roller's name on a 68 wheeler course he won his fame
Caller called Casey bout half past four he kissed his wife at the station door
He climbed in the cabin with his orders in his hand
Said this is the trip to the Promised Land
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin Casey Jones orders in his hand
Casey Jones leanin' out the window taking a trip to the Promised Land
Through South Memphis Yards on a fly rain been a fallin' and the water was high
Everybody knew by the engine's moan that the man at the throttle was Casey Jones
Well Jones said fireman now don't you fret Sam Webb said we ain't a givin' up yet
We're eight hours late with the southbound mail
We'll be on time or we're leavin' the rails
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
Dead on the rail was a passenger train blood was a boilin' in Casey's brain
Casey said hey now look out ahead jump Sam jump or we'll all be dead
With a hand on a whistle and a hand on a brake north Mississippi was wide awake
I see railroad official said he's a good engineer to be a laying dead
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
Headaches and heartaches and all kinds of pain all the part of a railroad train
Sweat and toil the good and the grand part of the life of a railroad man
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin


"Nine Pound Hammer"
Well, this nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
For my size, honey for my size
I'm goin' on the mountain, gonna see my baby
And I ain't comin' back, Lord I ain't comin' back
Oh, roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
How can I go when my wheels won't roll
Roll on buddy, pull a load o'coal
How can I go when my wheels won't roll
Well, it's a long way to Harlem, it's a long way to Hazard
Just to get a little brew, just to get a little brew
Now when I'm long gone you can make my tombstone
Out of number nine coal, out of number nine coal
Roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
How can I go when my wheels won't roll
Oh, roll on buddy, pull a load o'coal
How can I go when my wheels won't roll


"Chain Gang"
I was just a kid roamin' around
Travelin' through, a little ol' town
A man walked up and said come with me
You're broke and son that's vagrancy
A carefree lad that love to roam
But Lord I wish I'd stayed at home
The way it looks I'll probably hang
Cause there ain't no hope on a chain gang
I dig that ditch, I chop that corn
I curse the day that I was born
I believe it's better for a man to hang
Than to work like a dog on a chain gang
The guard stands there with a great big gun
I bet he'd love to see me run
And I guess, I probably will some day
I'd rather be dead than to live this way
He's well fed and he's six foot tall
And he's a meanest of them all
He cracks that whip and he swings that cane
That sun must've touched his brain
I dig that ditch, I chop that corn
I curse the day that I was born
I believe it's better for a man to hang
Than to work like a dog on a chain gang
I got a gal back home that's sweet and kind
But she's been waitin' a long, long time
I just told her to forget my name
I won't ever live down the shame
Lord, deliver me from this hole
Before I lose my mind and soul
The flesh gets weak and the back gets broke
There ain't no 'cause to laugh and joke
I dig that ditch, I chop that corn
I curse the day that I was born
I believe it's better for a man to hang
Than to work like a dog on a chain gang
Work like a dog on a chain gang
Work like a dog on a chain gang
Work like a dog on a chain gang


"Waiting For A Train"
All around the water tank waitin' for a train
A thousand miles away from home sleeping in the rain
I walked up to a brakeman just to give him a line of talk
He said if you've got money I'll see that you don't walk
Well I haven't got a nickel not a penny can I show
He said get off you railroad bum and he slammed the boxcar door
Well he put me off in Texas a place I dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me the moon and stars above
Nobody seems to want me nor to lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco headin' back to Dixie Land
My pocketbook is empty my heart is willed with pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home just waitin' for a train


"Roughneck"
Born to be a roughneck
I'll never amount to nothin'
Pullin' case and layin' pipe
Is hard labor
Well, I was born in a boomer shack
Bout a half mile from town
Papa was a driller on a wildcat crew
And my mama never was around
I learn to cuss when I was two
And fight when I was three
And by the time I was five there was no kid alive
Could ever get the best of me
Born to be a roughneck
I'll never amount to nothin'
Pullin' case and layin' pipe
Is hard labor
Well, I started workin' like a regular man
When I was just about knee high
Skinning the knuckles with my two bare hands
But they never heard me cry
I remember walkin' down the road
And hearin' somebody say
He was born to live a rougneck's life
And he's never gonna change his ways
Born to be a roughneck
I'll never amount to nothin'
Pullin' case and layin' pipe
Is hard labor
Born to be a roughneck
I'll never amount to nothin'
Pullin' case and layin' pipe
Is hard labor


"The Christmas Spirit"
Praises sing to Christ the King
And peace to men on earth
On Christmas Eve I dreamed I traveled all around the earth
And in my dream I saw and heard the ways the different people
Hail the king whose star shone in the east and what a dream it was
In London Town I walked around Piccadilly Circus
A mass of people movin' here and there, I wondered where
On every face at every place was
Hurry up, I'm late
But a kind old man at a chestnut stand said
Merry Christmas mate
And I felt the Christmas spirit
In a little town nestled down in Bavaria Germany
I walked along to see what the feeling there would be
And here again was the busy din, the rushin', the yellin'
But some kind boy said
Frohliche Weihnachten
Not understanding the words but gettin' the buyin' and sellin'
I felt the Christmas spirit
In Bethlehem I heard a hymn, some distant choir sang
And with other tourists I walked along to a Church as its bells rang
Then I heard someone tell someone
There's where Christ was born
I wonder if He looked like our baby looked on that first morn
And then I really felt the Christmas spirit
From a businessman in the Holy Land at a sidewalk souvenirshop
I bought a little Bible since I'd already stopped
And it was in Paris France somehow by chance that I took the Bible out
As I flipped the pages I saw these words
And I knew what it was all about
For I read
Fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy
Which shall be to all people
For unto you He was born this day in the City of David, a Saviour
Which is Christ the Lord
Then I took the little Holy Book, held it close and tight
I closed my eyes and visualized the glory of that night
So suddenly it came to me for when I awoke on Christmas Day
I felt the Christmas spirit down deep inside to stay
O little town of Bethlehem how still we see Thee lie
Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in Thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in Thee tonight


"I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day"
I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth goodwill to men
I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along unbroken song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men
And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong that mocks the song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doubt He sleeps
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth goodwill to men
Till ringin' singin' on its way
The world revolve from night to day
A voice a chime a chance so blind
Of peace on earth goodwill to men
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doubt He sleeps
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth goodwill to men
Classic Christmas


"Blue Christmas"
I'll have a blue blue Christmas
I'll have a blue blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red, on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when those blue blue heartaches start hurtin'
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red, on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when those blue heartaches start hurtin'
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas
A blue blue Christmas without you


"The Gifts They Gave"
Jesus our King, kind and good
Was humbly born in a stable of wood
And the lowly beasts around Him stood
Jesus our King, kind and good
said the donkey, shaggy and brown
I carried His mother up and down
I carried His mother to Bethlehem town
said the donkey, shaggy and brown
said the ox
This was my hay
I gave Him my manger, 'twas here that He lay
I gave Him my manger, 'twas here that He lay
said the ox
This was my hay
said the sheep with pearly horn
I gave Him my wool for a blanket warm
He wore my coat on Christmas morn
said the sheep with pearly horn
said the dove, from the rafters high
I sang Him to sleep that He would not cry
We sang Him to sleep, my love and I
said the dove, from the rafters high
And so every heart, by some good spell
In the stable dark, was glad to tell
Of the gift that he gave to Emmanuel
Of the gift that he gave to Emmanuel


"Here Was A Man"
(Joy to the world, the Lord is come)
Here was a man, a man
Who was born in a small village
The son of a peasant woman
He grew up in another small village
Until he reached the age of thirty
He worked as a carpenter
Then for three years
He was a traveling minister
But he never traveled more
Than two hundred miles from
Where he was born and
Where he did go he usually walked
He never held political office
He never wrote a book
Never bought a home
Never had a family
He never went to college
And he never set foot inside a big city
Yes, here was a man
Though he never did one on the things
Usually associated with greatness
He had no credentials but himself
He had nothing to do with this world
Except through the divine purpose
That brought him to this world
While he was still a young man
The tide of popular opinion turned against him
Most of his friends ran away
One of them denied him
One of them betrayed him
And turned him over to his enemies
Then he went through the mockery of a trial
And was nailed to a cross between two thieves
And even while he was dying
His executioners gambled
For the only piece of property
That he had in this world
And that was his robe his purple robe
When he was dead
He was taken down from the cross
And laid in a borrowed grave
Provided by compassionate friends
More than nineteen centuries have come and gone
And today he's a centerpiece of the human race
Our leader in the column to human destiny
I think, I'm well within the mark when I say
That all of the armies that ever marched
All of the navies that ever sailed the seas
All of the legislative bodies that ever sat
And all of the kings that ever reigned
All of them put together have not affected
The life of man on this earth
So powerfully as that one solitary life
Here was a man
(Joy to the world, the Lord is come)


"Christmas As I Knew It"
One day near Christmas when I was just a child
Mama called us together and mama tried to smile
She said you know the cotton crop hadn't been too good this year
There's not a lot of spending money and well at least we're all here
I hope you won't expect a lot of Christmas presents
Just be thankful that there is plenty to eat
That'll make things a little more pleasant
And us kids got to thinking how really blessed we were
At least we were all healthy and most of all we had her
Roy cut down a pine oak tree and we drug it home Jack and me
Daddy killed a squirrel and Louise made the bread
Reba decorated the tree with popcorn strings before we went to bed
Mama and daddy sacrificed because this Christmas was kind of lean
After all there was the babies Tom and Joanne
And babies need a few things
I whittled a whistle for my brother Jack
And though we disagreed now and then
When I gave Jack that whistle he knew I thought the world of him
Mama made the girl's dresses out of flower sacks
And when she ironed them down
You couldn't tell that they hadn't come from town
A sharecropper family across the road didn't have it as good as us
They didn't even have a light and it was way past dusk
And mama said
Well I bet they don't even have coal oil
Let alone apples and oranges and such
Me and Jack took a jar of coal oil nd some hickernuts we'd found
We walked to the sharecropper's porch and set 'em down
A poor old ragged lady eased open the door
She picked up the coal oil and hickernuts and said
I sure do thank you
and quickly closed the door
We started back home me and Jack
And about halfway we stopped looked back
And in the sharecropper's window at last was a light
So for one of the neighbors and for us it was a good Christmas night
Christmas came and Christmas went
Christmas that year was heaven sent
And my daddy put on his rubber boots
And paced the floor waiting for the thaw
Back home in Dyess Arkansas

"The Little Drummer Boy"
Come they told me
Our newborn King to see
Our finest gifts we bring
To lay before the King
This is to honor Him
When we come
Baby Jesus, I am a poor boy too
I have no gift to bring
That's fit to give a King
But may I play for You
On my drum
The Mother Mary nodded
The ox and lamb kept time
I played my drum for Him
I played my best for Him
Then He smiled at me
Me and my drum


"Ringing The Bells For Jim"
The father heard church bells at midnight
A wrong time for church bells to chime
He went to the tower, found a little girl there
Said
Why ring the bells at this time
I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
I'm sorry, I'm cryin' but my brother Jim's dyin'
So, I'm ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, pray for him this Christmas
He's sick and he's in so much pain
The doctors all say, he'll be gone any day
So, I must ring the bells again
I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
I'm sorry, I'm cryin' but my brother Jim's dyin'
So, I'm ringing the bells for Jim
On the day after Christmas
She brought him said
Father, heed little Jim
You see, he got well, when he heard the church bells
I was ringing the bells for Jim
I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
I'm sorry, I'm cryin' but my brother Jim's dyin'
So, I'm ringing the bells for Jim


"We Are The Shepherds"
So here is the stable and there is the manger
The new Saviour sleeps on His first earthly night
The wise men brought riches but we brought a candle
It's all that we have but it gives a good light
We are the shepherds we walked cross the mountains
We left our flocks when the new star appeared
Oh, the beautiful singin' of heavenly choir
We had to come see Him, we had to come here
We beg You forgive us for such a small offering
But our sheep are out there with wolves in the night
We bring You this candle it's all we have with us
But with it the new Saviour has His first light
We are the shepherds
We thank Thee kind Joseph for bidding us enter
Please take our gift for the new babe to thine
Tis only one candle but it is our symbol
Of how we believe that His great life will shine
We are the shepherds


"Who Kept The Sheep"
The shepherds afar left their flocks by night
Followed the new star by its heavenly light
Did the lambs fear the wolves
Did they lay down and sleep
Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep
Did robbers not steal or did they fear the light
That the shepherds had followed night after night
Did they not stray
Did little lambs weep
Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep
Under the new star, the new Saviour lay in his dim manger
He lay on the hay
The shepherds that came had a vigil to keep
But who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep


"Ballad Of The Harp Weaver"
Son said my mother when I was knee high
You need of clothes to cover you and not a rag have I
There's nothing in the house to make a boy's britches
Nor shears to cut a cloth with nor thread to take stitches
There's nothing in the house but a leaf end of rye
And the harp with a with the woman's head nobody will by and she began to cry
That was in the early fall and when came the late fall
Son she said the sight of you makes your mother's blood crawl
Little skinny shoulder blades stickin' through your clothes
And where you get a jacket from God above knows
It's lucky for me lad your daddy's in the ground
And can't see the way I let his son go around and she made a queer sound
That was in the late fall when the winter came
I'd not a pair of bridges nor a shirt to my name
I couldn't go to school or out of doors to play
And all the other little boys passed our way
Son said my mother come climb into my lap
And I'll chave your little knees while you take a nap
And oh but we were silly for half an hour or more
Me with my long legs draggin' on the floor
I rocked rocked rocked to a mother goose rhyme
Oh but we were happy for half an hour's time
But there was I a great boy and what would folks say
To hear my mother singin' me to sleep all day in such a daft way
Men say the winter was bad that year fuel was scarce and food was dear
A wind with a wolf's head howled about our door
And we burned up the chairs and sat upon the floor
All that was left us was a chair we couldn't break
And the harp with the woman's head nobody would take for song or pity sake
The night before Christmas I cried with the cold
I cried myself to sleep like a two year old
And in the deep night I felt my mother rise
And stare down upon me with love in her eyes
I saw my mother sitting on the one good chair
A light falling on her face from I couldn't tell where
Looking nineteen and not a day older
And the harp with the woman's head leaned against her shoulder
Her thin fingers moving in the thin tall strings
Were weave weave weaving wonderful things
Many bright threads from where I couldn't see
Were running through the harp strings rapidly
And gold threads whistlin' through my mother's hands
I saw the web grow and the pattern expand
She wove a child's jacket and when it was done
She laid it on the floor and wove another one
She wove a red cloak so regal to see
She's made it for a king's son I said and not for me but I knew it was for me
She wove a pair of bridges and quicker than that
She wove a pair of boots a little cocked hat
She wove a pair of mittens she wove a little blouse
She wove all night in the still cold house
She sang as she worked and the harp strings spoke
But her voice never faltered and the thread never broke
But when I awoke there sat my mother
With the harp against her shoulder lookin' nineteen and not a day older
A smile about her lips and a light about her head
And her hands in the harp strings frozen dead
And piled up beside her toppling to the skies
Were the clothes of a king's son just my size
The Christmas Spirit


"As Long As The Grass Shall Grow"
As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow
The Senecas are an Indian tribe of the Iroquios nation
Down on the New York Pennsylvania Line you'll find their reservation
After the US revolution cornplanter was a chief
He told the tribe these men they could trust that was his true belief
He went down to Independence Hall and there was a treaty signed
That promised peace with the USA and Indian rights combined
George Washington gave his signature the Government gave its hand
They said that now and forever more that this was Indian land
As long as the moon shall rise
On the Seneca reservation there is much sadness now
Washington's treaty has been broken and there is no hope no how
Across the Allegheny River they're throwing up a dam
It will flood the Indian country a proud day for Uncle Sam
It has broke the ancient treaty with a politician's grin
It will drown the Indians graveyards cornplanter can you swim
The earth is mother to the the Senecas they're trampling sacred ground
Change the mint green earth to black mud flats as honor hobbles down
As long as the moon shall rise
The Iroquios Indians used to rule from Canada way south
But no one fears the Indians now and smiles the liar's mouth
The Senecas hired an expert to figure another site
But the great good army engineers said that he had no right
Although he showed them another plan and showed them another way
They laughed in his face and said no deal Kinuza dam is here to stay
Congress turned the Indians down brushed off the Indians plea
So the Senecas have renamed the dam they call it Lake Perfidy
As long as the moon shall rise
Washington Adams and Kennedy now hear their pledges ring
The treaties are safe we'll keep our word but what is that gurgling
It's the back water from Perfidy Lake it's rising all the time
Over the homes and over the fields and over the promises fine
No boats will sail on Lake Perfidy in winter it will fill
In summer it will be a swamp and all the fish will kill
But the Government of the USA has corrected George's vow
The father of our country must be wrong what's an Indian anyhow
As long as the moon shall rise (look up) as long as the rivers flow (are you thirsty)
As long as the sun will shine (my brother are you warm) as long as the grass shall grow


"Apache Tears"
Hoof prints and foot prints, deep ruts the wagons made
The victor and the loser came by here
No head stones, but these bones bring the mascalero death moans
See the smooth black nuggets by the thousands lying here
Petrified, but justified are these apache tears
Dead grass, dry roots, hunger crying in the night
Ghost of broken hearts and laws are here
And who saw the young squaw, they judged by their whiskey law
Tortured till she died of pain and fear
Where the soldiers lay her back, are the black apache tears
The young men, the old men, the guilty and the innocent
Bled red blood and chilled alike with fears
The red men, the white men, no fight ever took this land
So don't raise the dust when you pass here
They're sleeping and in my keeping are these apache tears


"Custer"
Now I will tell you buster that I ain't a fan of Custer
And the General he don't ride well anymore
To some he was a hero but to me his score was zero
And the General he don't ride well anymore
Now Custer done his fightin' without too much excitin'
And the General he don't ride well anymore
General Custer come in pumpin' when the men were out a huntin'
But the General he don't ride well anymore
With victories he was swimmin' he killed children dogs and women
But the General he don't ride well anymore
Crazy Horse sent out the call to Sitting Bull and Gall
And the General he don't ride well anymore
Now Custer split his men well he won't do that again
Cause the General he don't ride well anymore
Twelve thousand warriors waited they were unanticipated
And the General he don't ride well anymore
It's not called an Indian victory but a bloody massacre
And the General he don't ride well anymore
There might have been more enthusin' if us Indians had been losin'
But the General he don't ride well anymore
General George A.Custer oh his yellow hair had lustre
But the General he don't ride well anymore
For now the General's silent he got barbered violent
And the General he don't ride well anymore
Oh the General he don't ride well anymore


"The Talking Leaves"
Sequoia's winters were sixteen silent tongue spirit clean
He walked at his father's side
Across the smoking battle ground where red and white men lay all around
So many here had died
The wind had scattered around snow white leaves upon the ground
Not leaves like leaves from trees
Sequoia said what can this be what's the strange thing here I see
From where come leaves like these
Sequoia turned to his father's eyes and he said father you're wise
From where come such snow white leaves
With such strange marks upon these squares
Not even the wise owl could put them there
So strange these snow white leaves
His father shielding his concern resenting the knowledge Sequoia yearned
Crumbled the snow white leaves
He said when I explain then it's done these are talking leaves my son
The white men's talking leaves
The white man takes a berry of black and red
And an eagle's feather from the eagle's bed
And he makes bird track marks
And the marks on the leaves they say carry messages to his brother far away
And his brother knows what's in his heart
They see these marks and they understand the truth in the heart of the far off man
The enemies can't hear them
Said Sequoia's father son they weave bad medicine on these talking leaves
Leave such things to them
Then Sequoia walking lightly followed his father quietly but so amazed was he
If the white man talks on leaves why not the Cherokee
Vanished from his father's face Sequoia went from place to place
But he could not forget
Year after year he worked on and on till finally he cut into stone
The Cherokee alphabet
Sequoia's hair by now was white his eyes began to lose their light
But he taught all who would believe
That the Indian's thoughts could be written down
Just as the white men's there on the ground and he left us these talking leaves


"The Ballad Of Ira Hayes"
Ira Hayes
Ira Hayes
[CHORUS:]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land
Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
Till the white man stole the water rights
And the sparklin' water stopped
Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed
[CHORUS:]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty
And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes
[CHORUS:]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
Ira returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored
But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no crops, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance
[CHORUS:]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
Then Ira started drinkin' hard
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
like you'd throw a dog a bone
He died drunk one mornin'
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes
[CHORUS:]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lyin' thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died


"Drums"
From the Indian reservation to the governmental school
Well they're goin' to educate me to the white men's Golden Rule
And I'm learning very quickly for I've learned to be ashamed
And I come when they call Billy though I've got an Indian name
And there are drums beyond the mountain Indian drums that you can't hear
There are drums beyond the mountain and they're getting mighty near
And when they think that they'd changed me cut my hair to meet their needs
Will they think I'm white or Indian quarter blood or just half breed
Let me tell you Mr teacher when you say you'll make me right
In five hundred years of fighting not one Indian turned white
And there are drums
Well you thought that I knew nothing when you brought me here to school
Just another empty Indian just America's first fool
But now I can tell you stories that are burnt and dried and old
But in the shadow of their telling walks the thunder proud and bold
And there are drums
Long Pine and Sequoia Handsome Lake and Sitting Bull
There's Magnus Colorado with his sleeves so red and full
Crazy Horse the legend those who bit off Custer's soul
They are dead yet they are living with the great Geronimo
And there are drums
Well you may teach me this land's hist'ry but we taught it to you first
We broke your hearts and bent your journeys broken treaties left us cursed
Even now you have to cheat us even though you this us tame
In our losing we found proudness in your winning you found shame
And there are drums


"White Girl"
I am stunned and I am broken and my head is in my hand
For she who said she love me will not wed an Indian man
My Gods who were wild ridden stand quiet by my side
For although I loved her she would not be my bride
Oh goodbye softly sweet one it was splended while it ran
Goodbye my bitter white girl I'll forget you if I can
She came up to the pueblo with her bright blonde hair
They told me not to love her but I did not care
She took me to her parties she carried me around
And I was a proud one the tallest man in town
For I found great wonder all wrapped in brilliant dreams
I held her strong but gentle as kings have held their queens
I learned to drink strong whiskey as she took me here and there
Until life without my whiskey I could not bear
Oh goodbye softly sweet one
Well when she came to leave me she took me by the arm
And she said she loved me and would not do me harm
But she would not marry not an Indian she said
She thanked me for my offer and I wished that I was dead
Now I'm back among my people and they are kind to me
Although I'm sad with staggers when I drink that tough whiskey
For I've been a white girl's pet a captive Indian
Shown off and discarded just a drunk who might have been
Oh goodbye softly sweet one
Goodbye softly sweet one


"The Vanishing Race"
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
Oh wagon trains rollin' along they fade from my visions and in time will be gone
I see an eagle in space my people will follow oh oh a vanishing race
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
An Indian brave rolled along one day on a lonely mountain trail
And he gazed below with a heart of woe where the prairie schooners sail
A vision formed like a mortal storm in the dust of the wagon train
A vanishing race appeared in space and he sang his sad refrain
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
Oh wagon trains rollin' along
Oh now great spirits on high please spare them the sorrow you show to my eye oh oh
Now my blankets are roll and I ride to the valley of the brave Navajo oh oh
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
And I ride to the valley of the brave Navajo oh oh
Oh oh a vanishing Navajo oh the vanishing Navajo
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou


"Orange Blossom Special"
Look a
Comin' down that railroad track
Hey, look a
Comin' down that railroad track
It's the Orange Blossom Special
Bringin' my baby back
Well, I'm going down to Florida
And get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe Californy
And get some sand in my shoes
I'll ride that Orange Blossom Special
And lose these New York blues
Say man, when you going back to Florida
When am I goin' back to Florida
Ain't you worried about getting your nourishment in New York
Well, I don't care if I do
Hey talk about a
She's the fastest train on the line
Talk about a
She's the fastest train on the line
It's that Orange Blossom Special
Rollin' down the seaboard line


"Long Black Veil"
Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me
The judge said: Son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Oh, the scaffold is high, and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me


"It Ain't Me Babe"
Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe
Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only let you down
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes to you
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe
You say you're lookin' for someone
To pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
And will love you for your life
And nothin' more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

"The Wall"
There's a lot of strange men in cell block ten
But the strangest of em' all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Starin at the wall
Starin at the wall
In his hand was a note that his gal had wrote
Proving crime don't pay
Was the very same gal he robbed and stole for
Wanting thier wedding day
Wanting thier wedding day
As he looked at the wall
So strong and tall
I heard him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
But I'm gonna be the first
I'm gonna be the first
Then the warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
Cause there is no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall
If you ever touch that wall
Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall
He never made that wall
Well there's never been a man who shook this camp
But I knew a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
But I know it was suicide
I know it was suicide


"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter, anyhow
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
Don't think twice, it's all right
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
So don't think twice, it's all right
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
Like you never did before
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
I can't hear you any more
I'm a
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right
I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, gal
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right


"You Wild Colorado"
Oh you wild raging river like my woman's lips you lure me
Pied piper of the desert roll on to the sea
You're the same at noon or midnight and I follow where you go
But you're planning no returning you wild Colorado
If I had no love of life I'd become part of your flow
But I fear the place you'd take me you wild Colorado
Oh you wild raging river from the fountains of the mountains
You ripple down the valleys growing wide and swift and deep
With what powed you cut your canyons how long ago
You're as wayward as my woman you wild Colorado
If I had no love of life


"Mama, You've Been On My Mind"
When you wake up in the morning baby look inside your mirror
I won't be next to you you know I won't be near
I'd be curious to know if your reflection is as clear
As the one that I've got on my mind mama you been on my mind
Well perhaps it's the wind and the dark dark night that's covering
The crossroads that I'm at
And maybe it's the weather somethin' like that
Byt mama you been on my mind mama you been on my mind
Well I don't need trouble please don't put me down or get upset
I am not pleading I won't say I'll forget
And I won't pace a floor bout down and bent but yet
Mama you been on my mind mama you been on my mind
Even though my mind is hazy and my thoughts are kinda narrow
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow
It don't matter to me where you'll be waking up tomorrow
Byt mama you been on my mind mama you been on my mind


"When It's Springtime In Alaska"
I mushed from Port Barrol through a blizzard of snow
Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks, the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon
When I walked in the door, the music was clear
Prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below
It was red headed Luie that was singing so sweet
I reached down and took the snow packs off of my feet
I reached for the gal that was singing the tune
We did the Eskimo hop all around the saloon
Where the caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug
We did our dance on a Kodiak rug
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below
Well, I was as innocent as I could be
I didn't know that Luie was big Ed's wife to be
He took out his knife and he gave it a throw
When it's springtime in Alaska, I'll be six feet below


"All Of God's Children Ain't Free"
I'd sing more about moral of this land but all God's children ain't free
I'd open up every door I can cause all God's children ain't free
I met a beaten broken man he shovels dirt but got no land
And he held out his hand to me all God's children ain't free
I'd sing along too a silly song but all God's children ain't free
I'm gonna sing the blues for the men they done wrong
Cause all God's children ain't free
Mister how bout the man you condemn to die
But taking everything that he's livin' by
And reject him from society all God's children ain't free
No reject him from society all God's children ain't free
I'd be happy walking any street but all God's children ain't free
I'd have a smile for all I meet but all God's children ain't free
I'd whistle down the road but I wouldn't feel right
I'd hear somebody cryin' out at night
From a sharecropper shack or penitentiary all God's children ain't free
From a sharecropper shack or penitentiary all God's children ain't free


"Danny Boy"
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the flowers are dying
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so
But if you come, when all the flowers are dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an
ave
there for me
And I will know, though soft you tread above me
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be
And you'll bend down and tell me that you love me
And I will rest in peace until you come to me

"Wildwood Flower"
Oh I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtles so bright with the emerald dew
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue
I will dance I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart in her crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming my idols were clay
All portions of love had all blown away
Oh she taught me to leave her and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
She left me no warning no words of farewell
Yes she taught me to love her and call me her flower
That was blooming to cheer her through life's dreary hour
Oh I long to see her and regret the dark hour
She's gone and neglected her pale wildwood flower

"Engine 143"
Along came the F15 the swiftest on the line
Running o'er the C
O road just twenty minutes behind
Running into Cevile head porters on the line
Receiving their strict orders from a station just behind
Georgie's mother came to him with a bucket on her arm
Saying my darling son be careful how you run
Many a man has lost his life by trying to make lost time
And if you run your engine right you'll get there just on time
Up the road she darted against the rocks she crushed
Upside down the engine turned and Georgie's breast did smash
His head was against the firebox door the flames were rolling high
I'm glad I was born to be an engineer on the C
O road to die
The doctor said to Georgie my darling son be still
Your life may yet be saved if it is God's blessed will
Oh no said George that will not do I want to die so free
I want to die for the engine I love one hundred and forty three
The doctor said to Georgie your life cannot be saved
Murdered upon a railroad and laid in a lonesome grave
His face was covered up with blood his eyes you could not see
And the very last words that Georgie said was nearer my God to thee


"(I'm Proud) The Baby Is Mine"
Now don't laugh at the condition the lady's in
She soon could wear a cocktail dress again
But we get along without cocktails, mighty fine
This will be our first and I'm proud the baby is mine
Yes, I married her although I knew the kind of life she used to live
And 'cause I knew she loved me too, it was easy to forgive
And if you just mind your own business we'd be fine
Don't ever doubt I'm proud the baby is mine
She's awkward, yeah, but have you seen her face
Where there once was shame there's a sparkle in it's place
And her conscience is clear that's why her eyes shine
Mister don't ever doubt I'm proud the baby is mine
I married her although I knew the kind of life she used to live
And 'cause I knew she loved me too, it was easy to forgive
If you'd mind your own business we'd make it fine
Tell all her old friends I'm proud the baby is mine


"Hiawatha's Vision"
On the shores of Gitchgoomy by the shining big sea water
Hiawatha old and greyin' listened to the older prophet listened to lagu
And the young men and the women from the land of Ojibways
From the land of the Dakotas from the woodlands and the prairies
Stood and listened to the prophet heard lagu tell Hiawatha
I have seen he said a water bigger that the big sea water
Broader than the Gitchgoomy bitter so that none cold drink it
Salty so that none would use it
Hiawatha then spoke to them stopped all their jeering and their jesting
And he spoke to all the people
It's true what lagu tells you for I have seen it in a vision
I have also seen the water to the East to the land of morning
And upon this great water came a strange canoe with pinions
Bigger than a grove of pine trees taller than the tallest tree tops
And upon this great canoe were sails to carry it swiftly
And it carried many people strange and foreign were these people
And white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered
Then said Hiawatha I beheld a darker vision
Many hundreds came behind them pushed their way across our prairies
In our woodlands rang their axes in our valleys smoked their cities
Our people were all scattered all forgetful of our councils
Left their homelands going westward wild and woeful
And the man with bearded faces the men with skin so fair
With their barking sticks of thunder drove the remnants of our people
Farther westward westward westward then wild wild and wilder
Grew the West that once was ours


"The Road To Kaintuck"
We're goin' west to Kaintuck down the road to Moccasin Gap
Down the wilderness road
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap
There was a time when goin' way out west meant goin' to Kaintuck
The dark and bloody ground as Indians called it
Indians wars were ragin' and men like Daniel Boone and Michael Stoner
Came down the wilderness road like countless families did
Through a place in south West Virginia called Big Moccasin Gap
It's a hot day in '73 and this is my wife and my kids with me
Daniel Boone lost his boy the other day young Jim Boone is dead twenty miles away
The wagons turn and went back home even Daniel couldn't make it alone
I guess prob'ly Daniel could but he stopped awhile in castle wood
(If you love your wife and love your baby man
Turn your wagons back as soon as you can
Ev'ry Injun in these hills has gone berserk you never gonna make it to Kaintuck)
Ah I bet I'm gonna make it to Kaintuck
We're goin' west to Kaintuck down the road to Moccasin Gap
Down the wilderness road
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap

"The Shifting Whispering Sands, Part I"
I discovered the Valley of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
While prospecting in a western state
I saw the silent windmills, the crumbling water tanks
The bones of the cattle picked clean by buzzards
Bleached by the desert sun
I stumbled over a crumbling buck board
Nearly covered by the sand
And stopping to rest I heard a tinkling, whispering sound
And suddenly realized that even though the wind was quiet
The sand did not lie still
I seemed to be surrounded be a mystery
So heavy and apperceive I could scarcely breath
For weeks I wondered aimlessly in the valley
Seeking answers to the many questions that raced through my mind
Where was everyone
The barren valley where people must have lived and died
I sat down and buried my face in my hands
And resting I learned the secret of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
How I managed to escape from the valley I don't know
But now to pay my debt for being saved
I must tell you what I learned out on the desert
So many years ago
When the day is oddly quiet
And the breeze seems not to blow
One would think the sun is resting
But you'll find this is not so
It is whispering softly whispering
As it slowly moves along
And for those who stop and listen
It will sing this mournful song
Of sidewinders and the horn toads
On the thorny chaparral
In the sunny days and moonlight lights
The lonely coyotes yell
How the stars seem they can touch you
As you lay and gaze on high
At the heavens where your hoping
You'll be going when you die


"The Ballad Of Boot Hill"
Here lies less more
Four slugs from a forty
No less no more
Out in Arizona just south of Tucson
Where tumbleweeds tumble in search of a home
There's a town they call Tombstone where the brave never cry
They live by a sixgun by a sixgun they die
It's been a long time now since the town was a boom
The jailhouse is empty so's the Palace Saloon
Just one look will tell you that this town was real
A secluded old dirt road leads up to Boot Hill
Walk up to the fence there and look at the view
That's where they were hanging eighteen eighty two
It's easy to see where the brave men have died
Rope marks on the oak tree are now petrified
At night when the moon shines so far away
It gets mighty lonesome lookin' down on their graves
There lies Billy Clanton never wanted to kill
But he's there with the guilty way up on Boot Hill (Boot Hill)


"I Ride An Old Paint"
I ride an old paint, I lead an old dan
I'm goin' to Montana to throw the hoolihan
They feed in the coulees, they water in the draw
Their tails are all matted, their backs are all raw
Ride around little dogies, ride around them slow
For the fiery and snuffy are rarin' to go
Old Bill Jones had a daughter and a son
One went to college, the other went wrong
His wife, she got killed in a poolroom fight
But still he's a
Ride around little dogies, ride around them slow
For the fiery and snuffy are rarin' to go
When I die, take my saddle from the wall
Place it on my old pony, lead him out of his stall
Tie my bones to my saddle and turn our faces to the West
And we'll ride the prairie we love the best
Ride around little dogies, ride around them slow
For the fiery and snuffy are rarin' to go
I ride an old paint, I lead an old dan
I'm goin' to Montana to throw the hoolihan
They feed in the coulees, they water in the draw
Their tails are all matted, and their backs are all raw
Ride around little dogies, ride around them slow
For the fiery and snuffy are rarin' to go


"Hardin Wouldn't Run"
I know a man whose plow handle hand is quicker than a light
Wes Hardin is his name they say he travels in the night
For he might have to kill or walk around a fight
And if you ever saw Wes Hardin draw you know he can skin his gun
He won't say how many tried and died
Up against the top hand up against the wrong man cause Hardin' wouldn't run
He rode in like a Texas wind took the eastbound train
Goin' goin' with Jane Bowen till the law men caught up
So long Janie chin up I'll be back again
Off he went to Huntsville Prison so long Janie he cried
Fifteen years she waited till her heart broke and she died
And she left that bad land to wait up in the sky
Free at last the payin' past for all the wrong he did
First free air they let him breathe since he was a kid
So let him come and let him go and let him deal and bid
Near the border in El Paso Lawyer reads the sign
You won't find him there for business every day at nine
For business is real bad one client's all he's had in quite a long long time
Then sheriff Selman's boy broke in to Wes's woman's place
Up she jumped and pistol whipped him kicked him in the face
And John Selman demands revenge for this disgrace
You could see every night by candlelight in Hardin's favorite bar
She'd be hanging on his arm and very late they'd leave there
Headed for the Goose Hair glad it wasn't far
Right through the swinging doors John Selman came with a blazin' gun
Wes Hardin chug
John Wesley Hardin fell dead cos Hardin wouldn't run


"Mr. Garfield"
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Me and my brother was down close to the depot when I heard the report of a pistol
My brother run out and come back in all excited
And I said what was it and he said it was the report of a pistol and then he said
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Lord I knew the President was supposed to be at the depot that day
And we just would't believe that he's shot
But we'd run over there and there was so many folks around
That we couldn't see him but some lady was standin' there cryin'
And I said m'am what was it that happened m'am and she said
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Well everybody drifted off toward home finally
And they looked like they felt about as bad as I did
But in a few weeks I heard that the President was still alive
And I told my brother I said let's get on that train and go to where he's laid up hurt
Well when we got to his big house up there I asked the fellow
I said who was it that did it who was it that shoot the President
And he said it was Charlie Guiteau that shoot Mr. Garfield and I said
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man good man
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man low
I heard some fellow there that had been in the house to see the President
And I sidled up him to listen to what he was tellin' and he said
Mrs Lucretia Garfield was always at his side
In the heat of the day fannin' him when he was hot
He said that just that day the President said to Mrs Lucretia
He said Crete honey (he called her Crete)
Said if somethin' worse happens to me after awhile you get yourself a good man
And Mrs Lucretia said James (she called him James)
She said I won't hear to that now she said I love you too much but he said
You'll make some good man a good wife good wife
You'll make some man a good good good wife
(Don't pull in single harness all your life good gal
Don't pull in single harness all your life)
That's what he said don't pull in single harness all your life
Well a few days later I come back to where the President was restin'
And it seems everybody was cryin'
The flag was hangin' halfway up to the flagpole in front of the house
And everybody looked so sad and I asked a soldier boy there
And I said is is is Mr. Garfield and he said yeah he's gone
Gonna lay him in that cold lonesome ground down low
Gonna lay him in that cold lonesome ground
Well they laid the President by that long cold branch Mr. Garfield's been laid down low
Mr. Garfield has been shot dow Mr. Garfield's been shot
(Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low)


"Streets Of Laredo"
As I walked out on the streets of Laredo
As I walked out on Laredo one day
I spied a poor cowboy wrapped in white linen
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay
I can see by your outfit that you are a cowboy
These words he did say as I boldly walked by
Come an' sit down beside me an' hear my sad story
I'm shot in the breast an' I know I must die
It was once in the saddle, I used to go dashing
Once in the saddle, I used to go gay
First to the card
But I'm shot in the breast and I'm dying today
Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin
Six dance
Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin
Roses to deaden the clods as they fall
Then beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly
Play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the green valley, lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong
Then go write a letter to my grey
An' tell her the cowboy that she loved has gone
But please not one word of the man who had killed me
Don't mention his name and his name will pass on
When thus he had spoken, the hot sun was setting
The streets of Laredo grew cold as the clay
We took the young cowboy down to the green valley
And there stands his marker, we made, to this day
We beat the drum slowly and played the Fife lowly
Played the dead march as we carried him along
Down in the green valley, laid the sod o'er him
He was a young cowboy and he said he'd done wrong

"Johnny Reb"
You fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb
Saw you a marchin' with Robert E Lee
You held your head high tryin' to win the victory
You fought for your folks but you didn't die in vain
Even though you lost they speak highly of your name
Cause you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb
I heard your teeth chatter from the cold outside
Saw the bullets open up the wounds in your side
I saw the young boys as they began to fall
You had tears in your eyes cause you couldn't help at all
But you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb
I saw General Lee raise a sabre in his hand
Heard the cannons roar as you made your last stand
You marched into battle with the Grey and the Red
When the cannon smoke cleared it took days to count the dead
Cause you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb
When Honest Abe heard the news about your fall
The folks thought he'd call a great victory ball
But he asked the band to play the song Dixie
For you Johnny Reb and all that you believed
Cause you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb
(Yeah) You fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb
You foughtall the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
(Yeah) You fought all the way Johnny Reb


"A Letter From Home"
A cowpoke rode in one hot dusty day to a store down in old San Antone
He stood at the window and I heard him say do I have a letter from home
The postmaster looked through the mail that had come
Then smilingly shook his grey head
The cowboke looked sadly a moment at him and these are the words that he said
No letter from home no letter from home there's never a letter from home
(No message from mother and none from the other) there's never a letter from home
That night he was shot on the wrong side of town no more of those plains will he roam
I reached for my Bible and gave it to him and said son here's your letter from home
If only I had just a little more time to read it the young cowpoke said
I can't take it with me and I must go on then he died with his letter unread
The letter from home the letter from home no time for the letter from home
(The cowboy laid dead with his letter unread) too late for the letter from home


"Bury Me Not On The Lone Prairie"
Lord, I've never lived where churches grow I loved creation better
As it stood That day you finished it so long ago And looked upon your work and
Called it good I know that others find you in the light That sifted down through
Tinted window panes And yet I seem to feel you near tonight In this dim, quiet
Starlight on the plains I thank you, Lord, that I'm placed so well That you've
Made my freedom so complete That I'm no slave to whistle, clock or bell Nor weak
Eyed prisoner of Waller Street Just let me live my life as I've begun And give
Me work that's open to the sky Make me a partner of the wind and sun And I won't
Ask a life that's soft or high Let me be easy on the man that's down Let me be
Square and generous with all I'm careless sometimes, Lord, when I'm in town But
Never let them say I'm mean or small Make me as big and open as the plains And
Honest as the horse between my knees Clean as a wind that blows behind the rains
Free as the hawk that circles down the breeze Forgive me, Lord, if sometimes I
Forget You know about the reasons that are hid You understand the things that
Gall or fret Well, you knew me better than my mother did Just keep an eye on all
That's done or said And right me
Sometimes when I turn aside
And guide me on that long, dim trail ahead
That stretched upward toward the great divide
Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie
These words came low and mournfully
From the pallid lips of a youth who lay
On his dying bed at the close of day
Oh, bury me not and his voice failed there
But we took no heed to his dying prayer
In a shallow grave just six by three
We buried him there on the lone Prairie


"Mean As Hell"
The devil in hell we're told was chained a thousand years he there remained
He neither complain nor did he groan but was determined to start a hell of his own
Where he could torment the souls of men without being chained in a prison pen
So he asked the Lord if he had on hand anything left when he made this land
The Lord said yes there's a plenty of hand but if I left it down by the Rio Grande
The fact is ol' boy the stuff is so poor
I don't think you could use it as the hell anymore
But the devil went down to look at the truck
And said if he took it as a gift he was stuck
For after lookin' that over carefully and well he said this place is too dry for hell
But in order to get it off his hand the Lord promised the devil to water the land
So trade was closed and deed was given and the Lord went back to his home in heaven
And the devil said now I got all what's needed to make it good hell and he succeeded
He began by putting thorns all over the trees
He mixed up the sand with millions of fleas
He scattered tarantulas along the road put thorns on cactus and horns on toad
Lengthened the horns of the Texas steer put an addition to the rabbits ear
Put a little devil in the bronco steed and poisoned the feet of the centipede
The rattlesnake bites you the scorpion stings
The mosquito delights you with his buzzing wings
The sunburst are there and so the ants
And if you sit down you'll need have soles on your pants
The wild boar rooms on a black chaparral it's a hell of a place that he has for hell
The heat in the summers are hundred and ten too hot for the devil too hot for men
The red pepper grows upon the banks of the brook
The Mexican use it in all that he cook
Just dine it with one of 'em and you're bound to shout
I've hell on the inside as well as it out
My hands are calloused July to July I use a Big Dipper to navigate by
Fight off the wolves to drink from my well so I have to be mean as hell
A sheep herder came and put up the fence
I saw him one day but I ain't seen him since
But if you're needin' mutton we've got mutton to sell
We're cowpunchers and we're mean as hell
Neither me nor my pony's got a pedigree but he takes me where I'm wantin' to be
I'll ride him to death and when he is fell I'll get me another one mean as hell
I shot me a calf and I cut off her head
Cause the boys in the bunkhouse are waitin' to be fed
They rise in chime with the five thirty bell
And the best one of any of 'em is mean as hell


"Sam Hall"
Well, my name it is Sam Hall, Sam Hall
Yes, my name it is Sam Hall
My name it is Sam Hall an' I hate you, one and all
An' I hate you, one and all

"25 Minutes To Go"

And the whole town's waitin' just to hear me yell I've got 24 minutes to go
Well they gave me some beans for my last meal I've got 23 minutes to go
But nobody asked me how I feel I've got 22 minutes to go

And I sent for the mayor but he's out to lunch I've got 20 more minutes to go

"The Blizzard"
There's a blizzard comin' on and I'm wishin' I was home
For my pony's lame and he can't hardly stand
Lord my hands feel like their froze and there's a numb that's in my toes
But it's only seven miles to Maryanne
It's only seven miles to MaryAnne
You can bet we're on her mind for it's nearly suppertime
And I know that there's hot biscuits in the pan
Listen to that norther sigh if we don't get home we'll die
But it's only five more miles to Maryanne
It's only five more miles to MaryAnne
That wind's howlin' and it seems mighty like a women's scream
And we'd best be movin' faster, if we can
Dan, just think about that barn with that hay so soft and warm
It's only three more miles to Maryanne
It's only three more miles to MaryAnne
Come on Dan get up, you honory cuss or you'll be the death of us
I'm so weary but I'll help you, if I can
All right, Dan, perhaps it's best we'll just stop a while and rest
For it's still another mile to Maryanne
It's still another mile to MaryAnne
Late that night the storm was gone and they found him there at dawn
He'd made it but he couln't leave ol' Dan
Yes, they found him on the plains his hands frozen to the reigns
He was just a hundred yards from Maryanne
He was just a hundred yards from MaryAnne


"Sweet Betsy From Pike"
(Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei)
Oh, do you remember sweet Betsy from Pike
She crossed the big mountains with her lover Ike
With two yoke of oxen and a big yellow dog
And a tall Shanghai rooster and one spottled hog
Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei
They soon reached the desert where Betsy gave out
And down in the sand she lay rolling about
While Ike in great tears looked on in surprise
Saying Betsy get up you'll get sand in your eyes
Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei
Betsy got up in the great deal of pain
She said she'd go back to Pike County again
But I gave a sigh then he fondly embraced
And he traveled along with his arm round her waist
(How can sweet Betsy went out to the dance
And Ike poor a fellow he's down at his pance)
Betsy was dressed up in ribbons and rings
Said Iken you're an angel but where are your wings
Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei
Well, the miner said Betsy will you dance with me
She answere I will if you want make two free
I can't dance too hard do you want to know why
Because I'm so full of that strong out cooli
Ike and sweet Betsy got married of course
But Ike was so jealous he gotta divorce
And Betsy well satidfied said with a shout
Goodbye forever I'm glad you've backed out
Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei


"Green Grow The Lilacs"
Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew
Green grow the lilacs when winter is thru
Each time I see lilacs my heart breaks in two
Cause springtime is here and its here without you
As sure as the bluebirds that fly up above
Springtime is sad without someone to love
Yes springtime is sad and it troubles my mind
In a world full of women, not one girl is mine
Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew
Green grow the lilacs when winter is thru
Each time I see lilacs my heart breaks in two
Cause springtime is here and its here without you
They say that its best to forget what we had
Then it is to remember and always be said
But still I keep wondering each now and then
If ever Ill see you and kiss you again
Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew
Green grow the lilacs when winter is thru
Each time I see lilacs my heart breaks in two
Cause springtime is here and its here without you


"Stampede"
We made camp along Red River
Watched the cattle as they bedded down
Back at the wagons, right after supper
We spread our bedrolls on the ground
And me and Willie, we took the night guard
And the sage never smelled so sweet
The prairie moon, was blazin' silver
No chance tonight for a stampede
Way over yonder, off in the distance
Towards the mountains there in the west
Did I see lightnin', did I hear thunder
My mind is weary, I could use some rest
Then all at once, the wind shifts directions
The clouds roll in behind the tumbleweeds
These longhorn cattle, are gettin' restless
God help us all, if they stampede
Smell the rain, hear the thunder
The midnight sky, turns black as death
The lightnin' crashes, smell the sulphur
It's rank and strong, it's Satan's breath
The cattle rise up, and go to runnin'
I spur my pony on and take the lead
And across the herd, I can hear Willie yellin'
Hey Stampede
Dust clouds rise, as the rain falls
They mix together, turn the air to mud
I feel the longhorns brush against me
And I can feel the demons racin' through my blood
Then all at once, my pony stumbles
We hit the ground, I rise up to my knees
In a flash of light, I can see the cattle comin'
Lord I know I'm gonna die in this stampede
Then I awake, and I look around me
I'm in my bedroll and I'm layin' on the ground
Over there's the wagon, and there's the campfire
I was only dreamin', but what's that sound
Then I feel the earth tremble underneath me
As the midnight sky begins to bleed
And from the blackness I can hear Willie yellin'
Hey Stampede


"The Shifting Whispering Sands, Part II"
Listen to the angel's story of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
Yes they always whisper to me
Of the days of long ago
When the settler and the miner
Fought the crafty Navajo
How the cattle roamed the valley
Happy people worked the land
Now everything is covered
By The Shifting, Whispering Sands
A miner left his buck board
Went to work his claim that day
And the burrows broke their halters
When they thought he'd gone to stay
How they found that ancient miner
Lying dead upon the sands
And for months they could but wonder
Did he die by human hands
So they dug his grave and laid him
On his back and crossed his hands
And his secret still is covered
By the Shifting, Whispering Sands
And his secret is still hidden
By the Shifting, Whispering Sands
This is what they always whisper to me
Out on the quiet desert air
Of the people and the cattle
And that miner lying there
So if you want to learn the secret
Wander through this quiet land
And I'm sure you'll hear the story
Of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
And I'm sure you'll hear the story
Of the Shifting, Whispering Sands


"Reflections"
Never in this world before or nevermore hereafter
Could a land know such a people as the pioneer the cowboy
His clothes his conversation his unique brand of lingo
All his devil deeds of daring his hat his bandana the dirty boots and ragged chaps
But mainly that sixgun dangling so's his hand could get it quickly
But draw your own conclusions lean to your own understandings
Your beliefs and your convictions
Disprove any fact recorded in these sounds and songs and legends
But I ask you if you do be sure you've walked in many mocassins
Over many many pathways and that you have listened carefully
Really listened to the west wind and to everything it whispers
And then go back and listen listen to this once more to these legends and traditions
They're only one reflection of a tick of time of that time
Just ponder on the things that happened
As we gaze so very deeply in the time and place and persons
Seeing now and then the West as it really was
And to tell you of a little that we saw there
And looking backward through a century
There was the True West there was the Real True West
Not demanding an argument but rather hoping you looked with us
And saw it as we saw it
And heard that west wind screaming shouting almost speaking
Always whispering of these things we sang and spoke of
And you'll hear perhaps the things the we said in the stories
And the legends and traditions
Through the wind that breeze these tales of the ones who never made it
Yet fighting heat and mountains plains and valleys snow and hunger
They went westward westward westward


"Rodeo Hand"
He's a rodeo hand a dyin' breed driftin' like a tumble weed
Rollin' where the urge tells him to go
And all this cowboy really needs is a tank of gas and entry fees
To get him to the next big rodeo
Now most athletes take alfalfa pills and super B's
A cowboy don't need all that motern stuff
A cowboy's gotta be lean and mean he trains on caffine and nicotine
And them all night drives help to make him tough
He's underfed and under paid and too damn hungry to be afraid
Some where between the crazy and insane
Cowboys ain't afraid pf dyin' shoot he'd even ride a red eyed Lion
If you'd show him where to take the rein
Now the only coach a cowboy needs is a growlin' gut that says come on let's eat
So tonight cowboy you better make a winning ride
Bout the only thing that makes him go
Is that big gold buckle waitin' down the road
And a bad case of too much cowboy pride


"Everybody Loves A Nut"
Everybody loves a nut the whole world loves a weirdo
Brains are in a rut but everybody loves a nut
There was a hermit named Fred who kept the dead horse in his cave
And everyone said to Fred
Fred how come you keep a dead horse in your cave and he said well
(Everybody loves a nut the whole world loves a weirdo)
Brains are in a rut but everybody loves a nut
A columbia man named Frank had a tiger named Hank
He tried to put Hank in his tank guess what happened to ol' Frank
When they picked up the teets there and eyeballs
And erected a tombstone that read
(Everybody loves a nut...)
Another Columbia fella told queen Isabella
I don't think the world is flat and now what do you think about that
And she said you don't and he said no ma'm
And she said he'd get out of my queendom and he said yes ma'm
(Everybody loves a nut...)
Everybody loves a nut...)


"The One On The Right Is On The Left"
There once was a musical troupe
A pickin' singin' folk group
They sang the mountain ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They were long on musical ability
Folks thought they would go far
But political incompatibility led to their downfall
Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear was a Methodist
This musical aggregation toured the entire nation
Singing the traditional ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They performed with great virtuosity
And soon they were the rage
But political animosity prevailed upon the stage
Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear burned his driver's license
Well the curtain had ascended
A hush fell on the crowd
As thousands there were gathered to hear The folk songs of our land
But they took their politics seriously
And that night at the concert hall
As the audience watched deliriously
They had a free
Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy in the rear, said
Oh dear
Now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
Don't go mixin' politics with the folk songs of our land
Just work on harmony and diction
Play your banjo well
And if you have political convictions keep them to yourself
Now, the one on the left works in a bank
And the one in the middle drives a truck
The one on the right's an all
And the guy in the rear got drafted

"The Bug That Tried To Crawl Around The World"
Now you've heard of folks with a lot of ambition
But I believe just about the biggest case of ambition I ever saw
Was in a bug that I saw crawlin' along the beach one day
He was a mighty ambitious bug
On the beach one early mornin' as a day was newly dawnin'
And the sun again was warmin' all the chill thru'out the land
I saw me a bug a walkin' and at first I thought he was quakin'
Then I found out he was talkin' while he crawled across the sand
He was crawlin' mighty straight at a slow but a steady gait
And when I asked him to wait he said oh come on crawl with me
But I said where you goin' and he said you'll be knowin'
For I'm gonna make a showin' and you'll someday see
Well I stood there by the ocean I suddenly had the notion
That I start this big promotion so this challenge I enfirled said the bug
So I gave my wife a hug and I left my confy rug
So I could be the only bug that ever crawled around the world
Well he seemed mighty small and it was a long way to crawl
And I'm sure he couldn't swim at all so I try to discourage my friend
I said you know the world is round and there's mighty lotta ground
And there some water to be found before you reach your journey's end
And he said now don't you fret there's problems to be met
But I'll make it you can bet and this deed will bring glory to my name
You know they said man would never fly now he's soarin' in the sky
Cause he had the will to try so let me win my fame
So he crawled on out of sight as he sought that splendoured height
Neither lookin' left nor right but slowly marchin' toward his goal
And my knowin' he had started on his journey as we parted
Kept me from feelin' too down hearted for he was a mighty ambitious soul
Well I've looked everywhere I've been and seen a lotta bugs since then
But not one quite like my little friend when I think of him I'm filled with pride
Did he make it I don't know he was crawlin' mighty slow and he had a long way to go
And all I can tell you folks is that he tried he sure was an ambitious bug


"The Singing Star's Queen"
Twinkle twinkle little star who's the greatest star what are (Waylon)
Now Waylon is a singer a record sellin' star the ladies love him and his band
Oh he sings like a bird and he plays a fine guitar
But I doubt that he's a home lovin' man
You oughta see his woman she's really a queen he buys her the finest of clothes
For you talk about beauties like none you ain't seen
When Waylon's gone she lets me know
When he's gone a singing I'm gone with his queen spreadin' his money around
But if you'll look for me and I can't be seen you'll know that Waylon's back in town
When Waylon's gone a singing I'm wearin' his suit I smoke his imported cigars
I like his woman wear out his boots I chauffeur his limousine cars
When he's making money he has to stay gone but if you should hear that he's around
Go buy his latest record or go see his show help me keep ol' Waylon out of town
When Waylon's out singing I'm gone with his queen
Starkle starkle little twink Waylon's the greatest star I think
Bring him to your town join his fan club the journal you get the journal every year
A dollar is about all is costs don't you dare miss it come see Waylon


"Austin Prison"
They had a warrant out for me all over the country
And I was trying to beat the raps in Idaho
I was breaking into a schoolhouse Sunday morning without warning
When I saw the sheriff coming for me slow from down below
His steel grey eyes were blazing when he saw me
His hand was on his gun when he rode up
He said you killed that woman I know you shot her why'd you do it
I'm taking you to Austin then I'm gonna lock you up
Well he tied me with a plow line the next morning
And he had me deep in Texas the next day
A crazy screaming lynch mob waited in the streets of Austin
But he put me in the jailhouse and he threw the key away
A jury found me guilty three months later twelve evil men with murder in their eyes
They even took me out and said now show us where you killed her
And that wicked judge said now I here by sentence you to die
But here I am far away from Austin prison my friend the jailer handed me a file
Now all I want between me and there are a lot of friendly people
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles


"Dirty Old Egg"
Well he's not very handsome to look at
Oh he's shaggy and he eats like a hog
And he's always killin' my chickens
That dirty old egg
Egg
I'm gonna stomp your head in the ground
If you don't stay out of my hen house
You dirty old egg
Now if he don't stop eatin' my eggs up
Though I'm not a real bad guy
I'm gonna get my riffle and send him
To that great chicken house in the sky
Egg
You're always hangin' around
But you'd better stay out of my hen house
You dirty old egg


"Take Me Home"
Well I've been from Boston to LA seen Boulder Dam and Frisco Bay
I seen New York City and Washington
Seen Montreal and Saskatchewan and Rhode Island
And I've worked in three all night service stations and I drove a truck
Take me home my heart is heavy and my feet are sore
Take me home I don't wanna roam no more
Well I slept all night in a water trough
Had the flu and the croup and the whoopin' cough
Had the mumps and the measles and the seven years itch
And I can't count the times that I've had a cold and a sore throat
Not to mention all the times that I cut my fingers on a sardine can
Take me home my heart is heavy
Well I can just see 'em all now just a gatherin' round
Mama's supper table when the sun goes down
And my good old pappy when the blessing is said
Fillin' up his plate with black eyed peas and all that stuff and side meat
And a great big hunk of my dear sweet mama's hot buttered cornbread
Take me home my heart is heavy
Take me home my heart is heavy

Just twenty short years from the day you were born
you died by the hangman's hand
Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning

He killed 20 men, by the time he was 10, he was an unruly kid
Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean for the one shooting that Joe Bean never did

He said
I can't set you free, it's not up to me, but there's much, Joe Bean, I'll do
I'll join your mother in extending Birthday greetings to you
Happy Birthday, Joe Bean


"Happiness Is You"
Way down the mountain I chased a moonbeam
On the beach I built sand castles too
My moonbeams faded my castles tumbled
All of this was meaningless cause happiness is you
No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars
I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are
My heart won't miss you my heart goes with you
Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you
I tried to doubt you and live without you
Tried to deny but I love you like a do
But I realize now and I'll admit it
You'll always be a part of me cause happiness is you
No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars
I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are
My heart won't miss you my heart goes with you
Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you


"Guess Things Happen That Way"
Well you ask me if I'll forget my baby
I guess I will, someday
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll get along
I guess I will, someway
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
God gave me that girl to lean on
then he put me on my own
Heaven help me be a man
and have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll miss her kisses
I guess I will, everyday
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll find another
I don't know. I can't say
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
God gave me that girl to lean on
then he put me on my own
Heaven help me be a man
and have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way


"Ancient History"
Just walk on out the door it's all over
Forgiving you is just a waste of time
I don't believe that I'll live to regret it
Cause you're ancient hist'ry to this heart of mine
So many times I've heard the same old story
Any fool can learn to read between the lines
And this time honey you've burned all your bridges
You're ancient hist'ry to this heart of mine
I've marked you down as just another lonely page
In the book of heartaches that you'll leave behind
Cause I've found out I'm better off without you
You're ancient hist'ry to this heart of mine
I've marked you down as just another lonely page
In the book of heartaches that you'll leave behind
Cause I've found out I'm better off without you
You're ancient hist'ry to this heart of mine


"You Comb Her Hair"
I know that you're wondering who I dream about
And if I've met someone who thrills me so
Well I finally met a girl who turns me inside out
I'll tell you about her for you ought to know
You comb her hair every morning and make sure she dresses just right
You comb her hair every morning and put her to bed every night
When she's around me sometimes I can hardly speak
I stammer and I act just like a fool
And just to hold her hand in mine makes me feel weak
You know her honey don't you know it's you
You comb her hair every morning and make sure she dresses just right
You comb her hair every morning and put her to bed every night


"She Came From The Mountains"
She came from the mountains Rocky Mountains eagle
She's from where the mountains lean up to the sky
Now she's back among the Rockies where mountain thunders cry
Now the wind from off the mountains wails a sad goodbye
Once in Colorado Springs at the foot of old Pike's Peak
I met a Rocky Mountain girl to my soul her heart let speak
We went to tell her parents and an old grandmother said
If you'll leave these mountains girl you'll wish that you were dead
The next day I took her with me to my far
Way out on the flatlands where the mountain winds don't moan
Each footstep we took was happy or at least it shoudn't been
But I would find her listening for that same lone mountain wind
She came from the mountains
Months passed as fast as antelopes until one fatal dismal dawn
I walked to see morning sun shine down on where she was gone
I'd known that lately she'd been sad women sometimes get that way
I hadn't guessed how much was wrong until that fatal day
She had left the weeping letter homesick with mountain names
She was somewhere in the Rockies and I knew I'd been to blame
So now in Colorado Springs I wait near old Pike's Peak
Where once I met a mountain girl that mountain girl I seek
She came from the mountains


"For Lovin' Me"
That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
Everything you have is gone that you can see
That's what you get for lovin' me
I ain't the kind to hang around
With any new love that I found
Movin' is my stock and trade
I'm movin' on
I won't think of you when I'm gone
So don't you shed a tear for me
I ain't the love you thought I'd be
I've got a hundred more like you
So don't be blue
I'll have a thousand 'fore I'm through
Now there you go you're cryin' again
Now there you go you're cryin' again
But then someday your poor heart is on the mend
I just might pass your way again
That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
Everything you have is gone that you can see
That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me


"No One Will Ever Know"
No one will ever know my heart is breaking
Although a million teardorps start to flow
I'll cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling
I'll love you but no one will ever know
I'll tell them we grew tired of each other
And that I was glad the day you set me free
I'll even make believe I never loved you
And no one will ever know the truth but me
I'll tell them we grew tired of each other
And that I was glad the day you set me free
I'll even make believe I never loved you
And no one will ever know the truth but me


"Is This My Destiny"
Cursed with sorrow pain and woe full of feeling I can't show
Hopeless love what else for me is this my destiny
At night I toss and wonder why I must live while others die
The grave would be escape for me from this my destiny
I know God surely made for every man somewhere a maid
Someone stole my love from me is this my destiny
At night I toss and wonder why


"A Wound Time Can't Erase"
Have you found since you turned me down
The one that you were searching for
Are you glad that you made me sad
For you know I vowed to love you ever more
What did you have in mind when you broke this heart of mine
Are you laughing in my face
Darling what can I do when you say we're through
You've left a wound time can't erase
Tell me now are you satisfied
To be foot loose and fancy free
Is it power you want for the things that you've done
What you've gained I guess I'll never see
What did you have in mind when you broke this heart of mine
Are you laughing in my face
Darling what can I do when you say we're through
You've left a wound time can't erase


"Happy To Be With You"
Happy to be with you happy to be with you
Happy to be with you bound to follow you
Somewhere someone above sents you to me for me to love
Hearts can tremble and shake hearts can shutter and break
I give more than I take cause I'm happy to be with you
Happy to be with you happy to be with you
Good times outweigh the bad count the good ones we've had
We have our ups and downs but the good times come around
Nickels and pennies are few don't have a fortune for you
Love you yes I do and I'm happy to be with you
Happy to be with you happy to be with you


"Wabash Cannonball"
From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
She climbs a flowery mountains o'er the hills and by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome she's known quite well by all
She's a regular combination on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball
Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
She's from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball
Here's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And always be remembered in the courts throughout the land
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
We'll carry him home to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

"It Ain't Me Babe"
Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe
Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only let you down
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes to you
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe
You say you're lookin' for someone
To pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
And will love you for your life
And nothin' more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

Oh I am a cheat and I'm a liar
Oh but you're a lovin' ball of fire

And while I'm home with the blues
I'll be hopin' like a kangaroo
When I get off of that fast boat to Sydney

Sunshine and showers and everything comin' up daisies
Oh what a good thing we had gone bad oh what a good thing we had
Driveins and picnics end every day was Saturday
Oh what a good thing we had gone bad oh what a good thing we had

Oh long walks by the river talkin' bout living together
Oh what a good thing we had gone bad oh what a good thing we had
Long weeks of waitin' and livin' for the day we marry

The whole wide world was jealous we wouldn't hear a thing they'd tell us
Never did need any money everything was milk and honey
Oh long walks by the river talkin' bout living together
Oh what a good thing we had gone bad oh what a good thing we had
Oh what a good thing we had gone bad oh what a good thing we had


"You'll Be All Right"
Well I see you've lost your honey bee
I know how you must be feeling now
You feel sad sad but boy it ain't that bad
You cry just a little bit and die just a little bit
And then you'll be all right
Well you know it wasn't long ago
Your honey bee was queen of my bee tree
But then away she flew and took my honey to you
You cry just a little bit and die just a little bit
And then you'll be all right
I pity you
I know what you're going through
You watched your queen bee fly
Your honeycomb went dry
But if you keep pushin' on
You won't care if she's gone
You cry just a little bit and die just a little bit
And then you'll be all right
You cry just a little bit and die just a little bit
And then you'll be all right


"No No No"
I'm a poor boy from the farm land
Your father is a wealthy sailing man
If I asked you for your hand
Would you tell me no oh no no no
You're a poor boy from the farm land
My daddy is a wealthy sailing man
He told me if you asked my hand
I'd better tell you no oh no no no
Your daddy brings you silk to sew
From the finest shop in Tokyo
He told you to turn me down I know
But don't say no oh no no no
Yes daddy owns a clipper ship
And he brings me pearls on every trip
And pink champagne for me to sip
And you're the poorest boy I know oh so no no no
I can't give you anything
I can't afford a wedding ring
A present that I'd like to bring
But oh I love you so oh don't say no
My daddy's three days out to sea
And he would turn me across his knee
If he knew you were kissin' me
But I can't let you go oh no no no oh no no no


"What'd I Say"
Come on honey don't you treat me wrong
Come and love your daddy all night long
Hey hey all right hey hey baby what'd I say
See that girl with a diamond ring I know where she got that thing
Hey hey all right hey hey baby what'd I say
Oh yeah honey you're so fine baby you're so fine
Honey you're so fine honey you're so fine
Oh you're so fine hey hey all right hey hey baby what's I say

Hey hey all right hey hey baby what'd I say
When you see me in misery come on baby and stand by me
Hey hey all right hey hey baby what'd I say
Baby what'd I say right now what'd I say right now honey you're so fine


"The Wind Changes"
It's not that I don't love you anymore
It's not that I don't want to
It's just that there's a line I have to darw
You've gotta cross it, don't you
It would take so little
You know I long to stay
Not until the wind changes
Not until my heart erases
Ever single memory of you
It's not that you can't hurt me anymore
It's not that you don't want to
It's just that there's a door I have to close
You've gotta lock it, dont you
There is darkness in our lives
We can't see the light
Not until the wind changes
Not until my heart erases
Ever single memory of you
I don't want to lose what we never had
I don't want the dream of living in the past
If you've gotta leave I don't want to know
I never saw you coming I don't want to watch you go
Not until the wind changes
Not until my heart erases
Ever single memory of you
Might as we be history
Every single memory of you
Not until the wind changes
Ooh
Every single memory of you
Not until the wind changes


"From Sea To Shining Sea"
The beautiful spacious skies, the amber waves of grain
To the majestic purple mountains above the fruited plain
God did shed His grace from sea to shining sea on you and on me
From Sleepy Hollow mountain country to the swamps of Okefenokee
To Guthrie Oklahoma, to Hibbing Minnesota
To Grants Pass Oregon, to Stone Pipe Wells, California
From Texas to Montana, from California to Maine
In the sunny days the winter snow from Arizona sand
To Cherokee North Carolina, to Tarpen Springs Florida
America, it's time to be refreshed, recalled to memory
God did shed His grace on Thee from sea to shining sea
The land is big the best is free
Sand and surf grass and tree from sea to shining sea
God shed His grace on me
And crown Thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea


"From Sea To Shining Sea"

"The Whirl And The Suck"
It took a mighty good man with salty hands
And a mighty long raft to keep the fore before the act
You take ten good men and guts and luck
And you might navigate the whirl and the suck
Well the Tennessee River changed its mind at Chattanooga she oughta unwind
She could a run right on the Georgia Sea but she cut right back through Tennessee
Well the settlers come by raft and boat bringin' everything that could stay a float
But like a loco horse that'll twist and buck
They hardly ever made it through the whirl and the suck
It took a mighty good man
When General Washington was in his knicker bocks
The Cherokee Indians through the Chattanooga Rocks
And the Chickamagua tribe and the Nickajack
They kept the watch where the river cut back
And if a raft or a boat ever rode the bend
The Indians got 'em cause they had 'em hemmed in
It took a mighty good man


"Call Daddy From The Mines"
A little girl woke up deep in the dark and started cryin'
The mother brought a light and held her daughter tight
She thought it was so strange to hear a little girl of nine
Cry call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine
Her mother wiped the tears and said see honey you're only dreaming
Your dad must work today he has to draw his pay
She left her then but still could hear her cry time after time
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine
Then the countryside was shaken by a mighty rumble
And fear for miles around was the trembling of the ground
The little girl was fast asleep yet cried out one more time
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine
Ten thousand tears and two weeks later deep in the smoking ground
A dying man was found had survived all those around
He'd quickly crawled to a fresh air pocket barely just in time
When he heard his own child whine call daddy from the mine
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine


"The Frozen Four Hundred Pound Fair To Middlin' Cotton Picker"
I left the field one evening my fingers so cold and sore
From fair to middlin' cotton 300 pounds or more
Jim McCann was still pickin' straddle in the row
The sun began to sinkin' and the wind began to blow
He was bound to get 400 a draggin' a twelve foot sack
I hollered out Jim come weight it but I only saw his back
So I went on home to supper and I gathered around my kin
I was thinkin' of Jim out there pickin' with winter settin' in
Next morning the air was freezin' the snow was nine feet deep
I jerked on my long red handles and I left my kids asleep
I got myself a shovel and went to where I seen Jim go
And commenced to a diggin' for him at the other end of his row
I found his body frozen and I took him in to thaw
I dragged in his sack and I weighed it and I added Jim's marks that I saw
The total was over 400 so he'd picked more than he'd bet
Of fair to middlin' cotton but Jim ain't thawed out yet


"Cisco Clifton's Filling Station"
It's not always the land that's the hardest and bitterest
It's the man who has the hard bitter attitude
Toward his fellow man or toward the land
Such is the case that you will find in this following song
About a man's attitude toward his fellow man and toward this land
I walked in the big yard to feel the warm sunshine
A ninety
He offered a smoke and he said as I rolled it
Tomorrow I'm going to break out and go free
They watch us by sunlight they watch us by spotlight
But I know a way for a man to go free
Down under my cell I'm diggin' a tunnel
The walls of a prison will never hold me
I told him that I'd have no part of his scheming
My time would be over one year from today
His eyes blazed with fire and he looked right through me
Bitter but broken again he did say
They watch us by sunlight
Next morning at breakfast the old man was missing
Then we all heard the rifles high up on the wall
He'd gone through the tunnel just like he had promised
And they said he was crying when they saw him fall
They watch us by sunlight


"The Masterpiece"
There was an old stone
And the old stone
And all around his cabin were statues the man had made
Statues that the buyers said were all of a mediocre grade
With his calloused hands he lit a lamp and laid down his head on his handmade table
And he softly whispered Lord I'm old and shaky and I'm hardly able
But give me strenght and wisdom and give me a week at least
And I'll climb up to the top of this mountain and chisel out a masterpiece
The very next morning he felt new strenght
And he took his brand new hammer and the sharpest chisel
He began to climb the mountain his old feet slipping in the freezing dizzle
When he finally reached the top he shouted to a world that didn't hear
I'll carve my masterpiece out of this marble boulder here
So the hammer beat the chisel and he hammered till an image grew
Then he stopped to look it over to appraise his work when he was through
It was a boy carrying a crippled boy and the old man said it isn't my masterpiece
I'll call it charity and then a masterpiece of mine will be
So the hammer beat the chisel til another immage in a marbel grew
Then the wind began to blowing and he sat and rested when he was through
It was the image of a mother holding her child
He said this is love as the world would know
But it isn't my masterpiece and he began again as it began to snow
The hammer beat the chisel as the snow fell harder and the wind grew and grew
He fell to his knees holding a stone and he threw down his hammer and his chisel too
He lay frozen face down in the snow but one hand was held for the world to see
Cut in the marble was his masterpice three neatly carved letters GOD


"You And Tennessee"
Like a sweet rippling mountain stream
Goes the sound of the banjo on Cripple Creek
Never beginning never ending just rippling on and on
So does the land just ripple on and on
As a heart gets soft on a woman so can the heart get soft on the land
And to fall in love with a woman as well as the land is to surely be in love
I stayed away too long I know and every day was slow to go
Every night I dreamed I was here it's been a mighty lonely year
Every mile I needed you I kinda hope that you needed me too
Everywhere I saw your face around every town I was in
This old familiar place welcomed me again
Back to where I belonged to be back to you and Tennessee
Back to you and Tennessee
Beside the Cumberland River where the grass is soft and sweet
We ran across the fields of cedar hiding from the noisy streets
And when the leaves fell from the cold the stars were silver the moon was gold
I said it's yours with love from me
I'm planting my roots in this ground and when they look for me I'll be found
With something that is part of me you and Tennessee
Back with you and Tennessee


"Another Song To Sing"
Do they ask you where I am or where I've been
Do they ever say where is the lonely friend
Is my name whispered in your bedside prayers
Do you feel a vacant spot beside you there
Well there's always one more path that I must walk
And there's people I should sit down with and talk
And somebody might appreciate the flowers I could bring
So there's always another song to sing
Do you tell them I was wilder than the wind
Do you remember that I needed lots of friends
And at other times I'd rather be alon
Where I could not be found when I was gone
Well there's always one more canyon to explore
To touch the things left by those gone before
At the top of the tiniest hill I can feel like I'm a king
And there's always another song to sing


"The Flint Arrowhead"
While traveling this land from border to border and from sea to sea
There have a few occasions to leave the beaten path and to find the place
And quiet that's good for thought and just walking through a trackless forest
Or exploring ruins of the earliest settlers or walking along a creekbed
Hoping to find a relic such as a tomahawk an axe
Or even an arrowhead left by a race of long since vanished Indians
There's a great thrill and it's a wonderful feeling to find a flint arrowhead
Over fields of new turned sod and in communion with my God I walked alone
In a furrow bed I found an arrowhead chiseled from stone
I don't know how long ago some redman drew his bow on its last fight
Or did he drop it here afraid white men were near to attack at night
I do know this one thing beyond all questioning it was made to kill
And proof of a master trade is in this arrowhead he made fashioned with skill
That I inherited this ground is denied by this stone I've found but when and by who
Come join me in my tracks then let's stop and look back to the vale and through
In love and peace we'll see the shadows and the trees and voices too
But quietly slowly tread this home of the forgotten dead whose bones are dust
I'm proud that their craftsmen's skill survives the ages still left in my trust


"Shrimpin' Sailin"
Turn on the speak it's the first time I get
To talk on the speak 'cause you know okay
Darn those smart alec, crazy cajon boy
Come in to my nice clean kitchens
And get into my pantry, get my blackberry jim jam
That I'd pick blackberries
And make a jim jam in the winter time
To take out on the shrimpin' boat
And bring in a foldin' wads
Of wondrous waddy for my little wienies
And they come in to my blackberry jim jam
In the pantry and get them all over
The nice clean kitchen table cloth
The smart alec cajon boy will play the music
Well, the Gulf it got a grassy bottom settin' where the rock is there
And that's where I've been goin' for the shrimpin' sailin'
Leapin' 'cross the grassy moss bringing in a briny bin
Makin' folds of wondrous waddy for the living that I'm lovin'
Where they creep and crawl and flip and flap and flob and dangle dobbin'
Sponge a fouler drag 'em holler more a course the ocean horse
Well, the Gulf it got a grassy bottom settin' where the rock is there
And that's where I've been goin' for the shrimpin' sailin'
Till it's time to haul 'em and come back in with the briny bin
Of soddy bodies dressed in dandy eatin' carmel candy
Makin' me and all by babies foldin' wads of wondrous waddy
For the livin' that I'm lovin' in between the shrimpin' sailin'
Gulf, it got a grassy bottom settin' where the rock is there
Leapin' 'cross the grassy moss bringing in a briny bin
Makin' folds of wondrous waddy for the living that I'm lovin'
Where they creep and crawl and flip and flap and flob and dangle dobbin'
Sponge a fouler drag 'em holler more a course the ocean horse
Till it's time to haul 'em come back in with the briny bin
Of soddy bodies dressed in dandy carmel candy eatin' chicken
Finger lickin', dancin', rancin', mancin', tancin'
Makin' me and all by babies foldin' wads of wondrous waddy


"The Walls Of A Prison"
There's alot of strange men in cellblock ten
But the strangest of em' all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Starin at the wall
Starin at the wall
In his hand was a note that his gal had wrote
Proving crime don't pay
Was the very same gal he robbed and stole for
Wanting thier wedding day
Wanting thier wedding day
As he looked at the wall
So strong and tall
I heard him softely curse
Nobody at all ever climed that wall
But I'm gonna be the first
I'm gonna be the first
Then the warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
Cause there is no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall
If you ever touch that wall
Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall
He never made that wall
Well there's never been a man who shook this camp
But I knew a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
But I know it was sucide
I know it was sucide


"Prologue"
We are in the Holy Land
The ground upon which I stand is sacred to the Jew the Christian Moslem Islam
To millions of people the world over and has been throughout the ages
This is the promised land
The land that God showed to Moses from a top Mount Nebo
Which we can see in the distance
At this place in Galilee the sound of God's voice has been heard
As He spoke to the prophets
Once man heard God's voice when He said of his son Jesus Christ
This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased
Such a blessing to be able to hear the voice of God has been given to very few
But such a blessing was given to the Land of Israel


"Land Of Israel"
From the top of Sinai
to the Sea of Galilee
Every hill and plain is home
Every place is dear to me
There the breezes tell the stories
Oh, what stories they do tell
Of the mighty things that happened
In the Land of Israel
Here, where Moses and the prophets
Spoke of One who would be king
Of a Heavenly Messiah
And the blessings He would bring
Oh, to hear the call again
All is peaceful, all is well
Upon every rock and mountain
In the land of Israel


"Mother's Love"
We are in Nazareth within a few feet of this place Jesus lived as a child
With his father Joseph the carpenter and his mother Mary
In Jerusalem the mother of Jesus watched her son die on the cross
She stood by to give him the only thing that she had left a mother's love
It was my mother who first told me of Israel stories of this land
That made it so dear to me that I am draw like a prodigal son to relive these stories
Here's a two thousand year old story that tells of the strength of a mother's love
Once a young man lived with his mother beside a great forest
The young man was in love with a beautiful girl who lived in the forest
He told the girl in the forest that if she would marry him
He would bring her anything that she asked
Knowing that the young man lived with his mother the girl said
Take your dagger and cut out your mother's heart
And bring it to me and I will marry you
Well this made the young man very sad
But he wanted to merry the girl so he killed his mother and cut out her heart
Running through the forest with his mother's heart in his hands
He stumbled and fell and dropped the heart
As he was getting up his mother's heart cried out from the ground
My son did you hurt yourself when you fell


"This Is Nazareth"
The noises you hear in the background are the different little shops
Here in the market place in Nazareth
There's a man beating out some pans with a hammer there
You know looking at Nazareth especially in this part of Nazareth
You'd be inclined to feel like Nathaniel did when he said to Phillip in the Bible
Can there be any good thing ever come from Nazareth
And John the Babtist preaching repentance down on the Jordan River
Which we'll be seeing later on today
Said there's one coming after me the latchet of whose shoes
I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose
And the prophets had said referring to this place right here
He shall be called a Nazarene


"Nazarene"
Caesar ruled Rome and all its glory
Every land called Alexander Great
But no man can compare in any story
With the one man who controls so many's fate
Yes along the dusty road came the Nazarene
Baptized by John was the Nazarene
Preaching on the top of the mountain was the Nazarene
Followed by the multitude was the Nazarene
Tried and condemned they laid their stripes on Him
But like He said back from the dead came the Nazarene
Nothing good had ever come from Nazareth
An unimportant place in Galilee
But the soul of any man could fall into bondage
And God had promised man could be set free
And then along the dusty road came the Nazarene
Baptized by John was the Nazarene
Preaching on the top of the mountain was the Nazarene
Followed by the multitude was the Nazarene
Tried and condemned they laid their stripes on Him
But like He said back from the dead came the Nazarene


"Town Of Cana"
We are in the Town of Cana
It is a short distance from Nazareth toward the Sea of Galilee
And on his way to Capernaum Jesus stopped at a wedding feast
Here which he was invited to
And when he came to the feast he was told that the family was so poor
That they didn't have wine for the wedding feast
So Christ at this very spot that we are entering right now
On which a church stands over
Jesus ordered the jugs filled with water
And then when they were served at the feast
When the jugs were poured around to the different people
It was wine of the finest wine that was known in Galilee at that time
We are entering now down into a kind of a crypt
Where the miracle actually took place
And there is one of the jugs here
That supposedly was one of those he used to pour the wine from that had been water
And the well that the water was drawn from
We are at the place where the water cintern was
It is all undeground as most people lived back then under ground because it was cool
This is where the water came from
He turned the water into wine


"He Turned Water Into Wine"
He turned the water into wine he turned the water into wine
In the little Cana town the word went all around that he turned the water into wine
Well he walked upon the Sea of Galilee he walked upon the Sea of Galilee
Shouted far and wide he calmed the raging tide and walked upon the Sea of Galilee
He turned the water into wine
He healed the leper and the lame he healed the leper and the lame
He said go and tell no man but they shouted it through the land
That he healed the leper and the lame
He turned the water into wine
He fed the hungry multitude yes he fed the hungry multitude
With a little bit of fish and bread they said everyone was fed
He fed the hungry multitude
He turned the water into wine


"My Wife June At The Sea Of Galilee"
This is the 23rd of April no May, 23rd of May and John and I are
sitting on the veranda of a hotel that is in Tiberias Israel
It is right on the Sea of Galilee
We can see to our left the place where they held the Sermon On The Mount
And across the lake is now the land of Israel
But up until eleven months ago was held by Syria
On down to the right further down the Jordan River joins the Sea if Galilee
And it's a beautiful day with the birds
You can hear the motor boats on the lake only one that I can see
And then a big pleasure boat that is coming across the other side
from the Sea of Galilee
The lake at this point I'd say is about eight miles wide and it's fourteen miles long
Hmm that's right June Israel is really again in its glory
This is a beautiful place
It's in much greater glory that she was in the days of King Herod
I'm proud to say for the Jews today King Herod gained the throne like a fox
Ruled like a lion and died like a dog


"Beautiful Words"
We're at the place of the Sermon on the mount
Beautiful words beautiful words He spoke beautiful words
The wind lay still and the whole world listened as He spoke beautiful words
Blessed are the poor in spirit for their is the Kingdom of Heaven
Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled
Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy
Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the Children of God
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake
For their is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile ye
And persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for My sake
Beautiful words beautiful words He spoke beautiful words
The wind lay still and the whole world listened as He spoke beautiful words


"Our Guide Jacob At Mount Tabor"
We are now up on top of Mount Tabor
And Jacob you're our guide so how about telling us in your own words
Just what happened at this place
I hope the wind is not making too much noise we are at a great height up here
(Here we are this is Mount Tabor
We are standing on the highest of the lower Galilee mountains watching around us
A most magnificent view really one can except to see
This of course is the Mountain of Trans
Where Christ with his three elder disciples climbed up the mountain
And that is when at the same time they all spoke saying
Master Master can we have three tents made here
The place is so beautiful we want to stay
And at that same moment they saw Christ was conversing
With Moses and Delijah the prophet
A cloud came from which the voice of the Lord was heard saying
This is my son my chosen son Thou shalt obey
They watched to the face of Christ at that time
And saw that there was light around it
He was transfigured His tunic became as white as snow
So it's called the Mountain of Trans
This is where it happened)
Thank you very much Jacob and you know there was another time that Moses
That you were talking about Moses climbed the mountain


"The Ten Commandments"
Moses led God's children out to find the promised land
And on the way he'd stop each day and look to Heaven and
Asked God for help as he could not withstand the task alone
And then one day he looked away and thereby lay a stone
God said write upon this stone these words I say to you
And if you all obey my rules I'll see you safely through
God opened Heaven's door and then He guided Moses' hands
And then He said go and tell my children these are my commands
Go and climb that mountain Moses climb that mountain now and pray
Climb that mountain now and tell us what our Lord has had to say
Thou shalt have no Gods before me is my great command
And thou shalt not make any graven image by thy hand
Thou shalt not take my name in vain if thou would guiltless be
Remember thou to keep the sabbath day alone for me
Honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt not kill
Thou shalt not commit adult'ry and thou shalt not steal
Love thy neighbor as thyself and show thy neighbor peace
Covet not thy neighbor's house nor anything that's his
Go and climb that mountain
Moses showed these words of God to all the children then
They pulled up stakes and headed out to find the promised land
That Moses had described to them and told of comforts there
The children of oppression thought they'd not find anywhere
But they were soon to part from him and push alone awhile
For it was never meant for him to walk that final mile
The children cried if we must go on Moses without you
Then talk to God just one more time and tell us what to do
Go and climb that mountain
Thou shalt have no Gods before me


"Daddy Sang Bass"
I remember when I was a lad
times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people, that's all we were
Trying to make a living out of black land dirt
We'd get together in a family circle singing loud
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the Throne
No, the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Now I remember after work
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singing for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
But, I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Cause singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the Throne
Oh, no the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
At San Quentin


"At The Wailing Wall"
We're approaching the Wailing Wall now
Which is all that remains of the ancient temple the holiest place of the Jews
Jews of all sects all tribes from all over the world are coming to the Wailing Wall
You can hear some of the faithful
Praying in the background here before the Wailing Wall


"Come To The Wailing Wall"
Oh my Lord what a mornin' oh my Lord what a day
The sound of battle's over and the smoke has blown away
Come to the Wailing Wall come to the Wailing Wall
Thank God you can stand up on this Holy Land
And touch the hallowed rock that God delievered to our hand
Come to the Wailing Wall come to the Wailing Wall
Shout it cross the mountain shout it cross the sea
We have been delievered Israel is free
Come to the Wailing Wall
Bring the lost ones homeward lead them to this shore
The city gates are open heaven's blessing o'er
Come to the Wailing Wall


"In Bethlehem"
Now we are in the city of Bethlehem
At the door of the Church of the Nativity where Christ was born
The gate has been walled up then enters into the church because of the horsemen
That used to come attack the place and sack the church
It's been walled up to where there's just a very narrow opening of about
Three and a half feet where you enter into the Church of Nativity
So now we enter into the place where Christ was born
This is the place where Christ was born to the world over it's a mighty big place
Actually physically it's a small cave underneath the Church of the Nativity
Many other people are here today to see this place
Before me is the actual spot where Christ was born undisputed to the ages
This place was found and confirmed that it was the place of the Nativity
By St Helene mother of Constantine the Emperor of Rome
In the third and the fourth century
Just a few feet away from this place where Christ was born
Where there is a Star of Bethlehem in the manger
Where he was taken wrapped in swaddling clothes
Meaning loose
Where he was come and visited at this very spot by the three Wisemen from the east
One of the holiest of holy places
In the Christian tradition the Holy Family retreated here
During the massacre of the holy innocence ordered by King Herod
And just as we left the Church of the Nativity a few minutes ago
We saw another cave where so many of the children
That King Herod had killed under two years old were buried


"In Garden Of Gethsemane"
I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses
And he walks with me
And he talks with me
And he tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing
And he walks with me
And he talks with me
And he tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
I'd stay in the garden with Him
Tho the night around me be falling
But He bids me go
His voice to me is calling
And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known


"The Fourth Man"
They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knees to Idols made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the Fourth Man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn
Now the prophet Daniel tells about
Three men who walked with God
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
Before the wicked king they stood
And the king commanded them bound and thrown
Into the fiery furnace that day
But the fire was so hot that the men were slain
That forced them on their way
Now when the three were cast in and the king rose up
To witness this awful fate
He began to tremble at what he saw
In astonished tones he spake
Did we not cast three men bound
Into the midst of the fire
Well, Lo, I see four men unhurt
Unbound and walkin' down there
There's Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
And the fiery coals they trod
But the form of the Fourth Man that I see
Is like the Son of God


"On The Via Dolorosa"
We are on the Via Dolorosa the way of the Cross having just left the Praetorium
Where Pilate said to Christ I washed my hands off the matter
And turned him over to the people and told them to do what they would with him
There's no traffic here the streets's very narrow
Little children playing along the street the street's about ten feet wide
You see the third station of the Cross
Where Christ almost fell under the weight of the Cross
He's kneeling and the fourth station of the Cross over there
Over forty or fifty feet farther toward Calvary
Where His mother came up to Him and said my Son what's happened
And she sees Him kneeling under the heavy weight of the Cross too
Continuing on now toward Calvary from the fourth station of the Cross
We left the Praetorium where Christ was sentenced and where he was turned over
To the Jewish people and they were offered Barabbas and they said
No give us Christ we'll crucify him
Following along the stations of the Cross passing station No 5
And they say at this point that Simon a Cyrenean coming out of the country
On him they laid the Cross they made him bear it for Jesus
And they continued on the way of the Cross as we are now
Leaving place No 5 toward Calvary it's a long long way from here
You can see standing here between station No 5 and No 6
Two hundred yards at least up the steps toward Calvary's hill
All along it's a very narrow street ten or twelve feet wide
Shops on each side little children playing old men and women
Carrying their bread dressed in their long robes
Just as they did two thousand years ago
The music here in the background is a radio playing (is that an Arab station)
Still continuing up the way of the Cross toward Calvary
The voices you hear in the background are pilgrims from all over the world
All along the Via Dolorosa here there are beggars (I suppose mostly Arab beggars)
Passing station No 10 continuing on to Calvary they are all along the way
They say that they are all blind
They say that the reason there are so many blind along
This part of the country is because of the dust
Everywhere the wind is blowing and the dust is flying
And of course there are germs in the dust that diseases their eyes
And the dust itself puts them out
On the way to Calvary we pass another beggar sittin' along the way
All kinds of shops pilgrims continuing on the same way we're going
Now closer to Calvary the way really gets crowded
It's still the same very narrow street though


"Church Of The Holy Sepulchre"
Approaching the shrine now where the Cross was where Christ was crucified
Also the place of the Holy Sepulchre where Christ was buried
Entering into the actual church now which is covered not only the tomb
Where Christ was buried but also the place where he was crucified
There is a very interesting story about this place of Golgotha
They say that when Christ was crucified and His blood came down the cross
And incidentally we are climbing the steps right now
Going up to the place where He was crucified
When He was crucified and His blood ran down the Cross
It ran into the ground and His blood touched the skull of Adam
The very first man ever on earth created by God Adam
And that just for an instant the skull of Adam came to life
From the blood of Christ touching it


"At Cavalry"
And now here we stand in the approximate spot where the Cross stood
In this very spot supposedly on this very spot is
Where Christ was nailed to the Cross Laying flat on the ground
I don't think at this time that it really
After what I've seen today and what is just before me now
That it makes a lot of difference whether or not
This was exactly the very spot where Christ was crucified
And I feel proud in that I am able in my lifetime to come and stand
If not in the exact spot within a few feet or a few yards
At least of where it all happened
Where our Christianity began the most holiest of holy spots for the Christians
Now I would like myself to kneel before this place here underneath the table
Where the Cross was supposed to have stood
If it's definitely not the place it's near the place
After Christ was crucified He lay upon the Cross dying
After He was dead Roman soldiers cast lots for His clothes
There was a Roman soldier Marcellus
Who won this purple robe of Christ in a dice game
And legend has it story has it that Marcellus was affected very strongly by this robe
And the effects of having seen the Crucifixion he almost lost his mind
And everywhere he would go for months and years after that he was like a mad man
He would go to this one and that one stand there and say were you out there
Were you there were you there when they crucified Him


"God Is Not Dead"
When Jesus called to God upon the cross
No answer came for his will must be done
Then how the word trembled at his voice
When he said this is my beloved son
It isn't God but man that's dead
When love is locked outside
Do you deny that there's a God or is God just denied
God is not dead he never died
What man on earth can make one blade of grass
And who can make one seed then make it grow
With all the power and wisdom in our hands
Who can command which way the wind to blow
And who can match the miracle in an eagle's eye
Or hang a rainbow in a cloudy sky
God is not dead he did not die
God is not dead God is not dead

"Wreck Of The Old '97"
Well they gave him his orders at Monroe, Virginia
Said
Steve, you're way behind time
This is not 38, this is Ol' 97
Put her into Spencer on time
Then he turned around and said to his black, greasy fireman
Shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Oak mountain
Watch Ol' '97 roll
And then a telegram come from Washington station
This is how it read
Oh that brave engineer that run ol 97
Is lyin in old Danville dead
Cos he was going down a grade making 90 miles an hour
The whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam
One more time
Oh, now all you ladies you'd better take a warning
From this time on and learn
Never speak hard words to your true
He may leave you and never return
Poor Boy


"I Walk The Line"
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
At San Quentin
I Walk The Line


"Darlin' Companion"
Darlin' companion, come on and give me understandin'
And let me be your champion: a hand to hold your pretty hand in
Darlin' companion, now you know you'll never be abandoned
Love will always light our landin': I can depend on you
Oh, a little saucy mare like you should have a steed
Oh, a little bridlin' down from you is what I need
Darlin' companion, now you know you'll never be abandoned
Love will always light our landin': I can depend on you
Darlin' companion, come on and give me understandin'
As long as we keep laughin', bear in mind just what could happen
Darlin' companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons
Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm gonna stick by you
Oh, a little saucy mare like you should have a steed
Oh, a little bridlin' down from you is what I need
Darlin' companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons
Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm gonna stick by you
Darlin' companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons
Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm gonna stick by you


"Starkville City Jail"
Well, I left my motel room, down at the Starkville Motel
The town had gone to sleep and I was feelin' fairly well
I strolled along the sidewalk 'neath the sweet magnolia trees
I was whistlin', pickin' flowers, swayin' in the southern breeze
I found myself surrounded
That's him
Come along, wild flower child. Don't you know that it's two a.m
They're bound to get you
Cause they got a curfew
And you go to the Starkville City jail
Well, they threw me in the car and started driving into town
I said
What the hell did I do
He said
Shut up and sit down
Well, they emptied out my pockets, took my pills and guitar picks
I said
Wait, my name is
Awe shut up
Well, I sure was in a fix
The sergeant put me in a cell, then he went home for the night
I said
Come back here, you so and so
Well, they're bound to get you, cause they got a curfew
And you go to the Starkville City Jail
I started pacin' back and forth, and now and then I'd yell
And kick my forty dollar shoes against the steel floor of my cell
I'd walk awhile and kick awhile, and all night nobody came
Then I sadly remembered that they didn't even take my name
At 8 a.m. they let me out. I said
Gimme them things of mine
They gave me a sneer and a guitar pick, and a yellow dandelion
They're bound to get you, 'cause they got a curfew
And you go to the Starkville City Jail


"San Quentin"
San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
You've hosted me since nineteen sixty three
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen them die
And long ago I stopped askin' why
San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and have scarred me thru an' thru
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man
Mister Congressman why can't you understand
San Quentin, what good do you think you do
Do you think I'll be different when you're through
You bent my heart and mind and you may my soul
And your stone walls turn my blood a little cold
San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good
San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me


"A Boy Named Sue"
My daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me
Sue
Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named
Sue
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky
And kill that man who gave me that awful name
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me
Sue
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said
My name is 'Sue
Now your gonna die
Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer
I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile
And he said
Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong
He said
Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Cause I'm the son
Sue.'
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George


"Peace In The Valley"
Oh well, I'm tired and so weary
But I must go alone
Till the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
Well the morning's so bright
And the lamp is alight
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me
Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me

"Folsom Prison Blues"
I hear the train a comin'
It's rolling round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone
When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin'
And that's what tortures me
Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
At San Quentin


"Big River"
Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die
I met her accidentally in St. Paul (Minnesota)
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport
And I followed you, Big River, when you called
Then you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river)
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone
Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough
She loves you, Big River, more than me
Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die


"I Still Miss Someone"
At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind has come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone
I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
because I still miss someone
Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
At San Quentin


"I Don't Know Where I'm Bound"
I don't know where I'm bound, I don't know where I'm bound
Whistles calling me away, leaving at the break of day
And I don't know where I'm bound
Can't stand bars, locks, or doors
Mean cops, insanity, and wars
Gotta find a place of peace
Until then, my traveling won't cease
But I don't know where I'm bound
There's gotta be a place for me
Under some green growing tree
clear cool water running by
An unfettered view of the sky
But I don't know where I'm bound
When I die, don't bury me
Cause then I must be free
Cremate my body with a grin
Throw my ashes to the wind
Cause I don't know where I'm bound
I don't know where I'm bound, I don't know where I'm bound
Whistles calling me away, leaving at the break of day
and I don't know where I'm bound
Got myself a little gal
She has been a downright pal
That old highway's calling me
And free I gotta be
But I don't know where I'm bound, I don't know where I'm bound
I don't know where I'm bound


"Ring Of Fire"
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire
[2x]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
The ring of fire, the ring of fire


"He Turned The Water Into Wine"
He turned the water into wine he turned the water into wine
In the little Cana town the word went all around that he turned the water into wine
Well he walked upon the Sea of Galilee he walked upon the Sea of Galilee
Shouted far and wide he calmed the raging tide and walked upon the Sea of Galilee
He turned the water into wine
He healed the leper and the lame he healed the leper and the lame
He said go and tell no man but they shouted it through the land
That he healed the leper and the lame
He turned the water into wine
He fed the hungry multitude yes he fed the hungry multitude
With a little bit of fish and bread they said everyone was fed
He fed the hungry multitude
He turned the water into wine


"Daddy Sang Bass"
I remember when I was a lad
times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people, that's all we were
Trying to make a living out of black land dirt
We'd get together in a family circle singing loud
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the Throne
No, the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Now I remember after work
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singing for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
But, I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Cause singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the Throne
Oh, no the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
At San Quentin


"The Old Account Was Settled Long Ago"
Well it was a time on earth when in the books of heaven
An old account was standing for sins yet unforgiven
My name was at the top and many things below
But I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees) long ago (I settled it all)
Yes the old account was settled long ago (hallelujah)
And the record's clear today cause he washed my sins away
And the old account was settled long ago
Well the old account was large and growin' every day
And I was always sinnin' and I never tried to pray
But when I looked ahead and saw such pain and woe
Well I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees)
Now sinner seek the Lord repent of all your sins
Cause this he has commanded if you would enter in
And then if you should live a hundred years below
Well you know you got it settled cause you settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees)


"Closing Medley"
I hear the train a comin'
It's rolling round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
Lord, I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
And that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone
[Spoken:]
Let's give her a big hand, June Carter
Helen, Anita, Mother Maybelle The Carter Family

But I shot a man in Reno, I shot him just to watch him die, Lord yeah
Now that train keeps a rollin', I hang my head down and cry
Johnny Yuma was the rebel he roamed through the west
Yeah Johnny Yuma the rebel he wandered alone
He got fightin' mad this rebel lad he packed no star as he wandered far
Where the only law was a hook and a draw the rebel Johnny Yuma
[Spoken:]
I wanna thank you for being so good to us. I like to say a special hello to all the men here at the prison that're not with us tonight If they couldn't find the key to the door or something. They couldn't let the bunch of them out here. I wish everyone of you could've be out here with us. All you guys I understand their pipe and the show in for you. Cell somewhere... that supposed... listening... maybe.Is that closed circuit television that you have in here, is it
Well if they'd freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it all a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away


"Bottom Of The Mountain"
I was born in West Virginia
Where the land is black with coal
For a man to feed his family
It takes twelve hours a day a diggin' in a dirty black hole
Way down in the bottom of a mountain
Way down in the bottom of a hole
Way down in the bottom of a mountain
I'm diggin' and a shovelin' and a loadin' out the dirty black coal
Some men give their wives jewelry
Some men give their wives gold
But all I can give to my sweet woman
Are the few dollars I make from diggin' out the dirty black coal
Way down in the bottom of a mountain
Way down in the bottom of a hole
Way down in the bottom of a mountain
I'm diggin' and a shovelin' and a loadin' out the dirty black coal
I draw script for most of my money
I never see a lot of that
I work all week and go to church on Sunday
Well the preacher gonna get what's left when they pass the hat
Way down in the bottom of a mountain
Way down in the bottom of a hole
Way down in the bottom of a mountain
I'm diggin' and a shovelin' and a loadin' out the dirty black coal
I'm diggin' and a shovelin' and a loadin' out the dirty black coal


"You Beat All I Ever Saw"
I've walked though every town
Saw fortunes lost and found
And when your trail failed i walked holes
In both my soles
But i don't expect you back
You're somewhere making tracks
I crossed the burning bridges
And walked through miles of sand
Met the lawless and the law
But you beat all i ever saw
I dreamed a million miles
About your eyes and smiles
I tried to love the best
And to turn from all the rest
But i'd scan the skies for you
And i only saw your hue
They drew away your mould
You were made of frozen gold
And your heart would never thaw
You beat all i ever saw
Rainbow


"Put The Sugar To Bed"
Out on a shrimp boat I just dropped the net
When the wind she come to blowin' whizzin' bad all to get
I look south east and golly me what I see
A black thundercloud with them fuzzy eyebrows
Come a lookin' direct towards boudleaux and me
I turned to boudleaux and me I said
Put the sugar to bed put the sugar to bed
Lock up the coffee in the coffee pot
Put the flour in your pillow cause it's all we got
Hang the lantern from the ceiling and watch your head
Ho boudleaux put the sugar to bed boudleaux put the sugar to bed
Well the sky she get dark and then she turn dark black
I yell she gonna blow one right out of the almanac
A big raindrop smacked me right on the ear
And I hollered hey boudleaux but the way the wind blow
He just as soon be deaf there wasn't no how to hear
I try to call to boudleaux but slid instead
Then me and boudleaux put the sugar to bed
Well the ends of that shrimpin' boat was switchin' around
She turned sideways and inners and outers and upside down
The water come in tryin' to drown the both of us
The closet top open and the shillet went a flyin' me I hit my head and kinda cuss
But most of all I frowned when she calm that I said
Put the sugar to bed put the sugar to bed
Ain't nothin' dry but my railroad watch the salt got soggy but we still can budge
We built a fire for the coffee and we chicory fed
Cause me and boudleaux put the sugar to bed
Me and boudleaux put the sugar to bed


"Girl In Saskatoon"
I left a little town
A little south of Hudson Bay
I couldn't find a thing, to make a rounder want to stay
I fought the wind across the baren waste in the crystal doom
Going for to marry the girl in Saskatoon
I'm glad I realized that no one could take her place
My heart was beating for her like the winter beat my face
But knowing that I'd see her made my spirit bright as June
I'm freezing but I'm burning for the girl in Saskatoon
South and West and following the cold December sun
I bedded down in the Carragana when my daily trek was done
Then up and pressing onward by the light of the morning moon
A prodical returning to the girl in Saskatoon
Then I found the trail that had packed beneath the snow
I made the final miles where the prairie lillies grow
The steeple on a church glistened by the prairie moon
I'm freezing but I'm burning for the girl in Saskatoon
My journey was forgotten
When I held her in my arms
My wonderlust was stiffled
By possesion of her charms
And even beneath the steeple
Where we couldn't wait till June
I found eternal spring with the girl in Saskatoon


"Time And Time Again"
I wish my heart was stone cause you're hard on flesh and bone
But even if my heart was stone I couldn't stand that long
Cause time and time again you're gone with the wind
And even when you're here I know you're making plans to go
You come back and I take you back but you like the shifting sand
And like the sand you shift right through my hands
Time and time again I got you time and time again
You come back and I take you back but you like the shifting sand
And like the sand you shift right through my hands
Time and time again I lose you time and time again
I wanna be your man so I give in all I can
And when I give in all I can I give up time and time again
You take whole of my hand and look at where I stand
Then I say this is my last stand time and time again
You come back and I take you back but you like the shifting sand
And like the sand you shift right through my hands
Time and time again I got you time and time again
Time and time again I lose you time and time again
Time and time again I got you time and time again


"Honky Tonk Girl"
Don't be fool by big blue eyes by a smile or a golden curl
Cause she'll love you now and then break every vow
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl
Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one
She knows all the arts of love she'll give your heart a twirl
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl
She can never change your ways though you'll give her all the world
She's had more than one or two and each day there's someone new
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl
Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one
She knows all the arts of love she'll give your heart a twirl
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl


"Locomotive Man"
I got a gal in Dallas, I wave at when I go through
I got a gal in Tulsa, that I toot my whistle to
(Say how do)
I got 'em all over the land, I'm a locomotive man
Left my heart in Omaha Omaha, and I never did quite get it back
I got a Sue in Sioux City, waitin' by the railroad track
(Keeps her money in a 'tater sack)
I got 'em all over the land, I'm a Locomotive man
Well, I left a little switch engine, 'bout forty miles south of Bangor Maine
Couldn't keep the wheels a turnin', shouldn't try to pull my train
I got 'em all over the land, I'm a Locomotive man
Well, I had a gal in Jackson, and it sure broke my heart to turn her loose
When I checked my time and moved on, she's hooked on my caboose
I got 'em all over the land, I'm a locomotive man


"Second Honeymoon"
I walked up to the desk and asked the man about a room
I asked about the bridal suite, I told him I'm the groom
Then I took the elevator to the floor I was assigned
I fumbled with the key the way I did that other time
Inside I thought of all the things that started in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon
I hear the happy people laughing in the street below
But the loneliness I feel tonight I hope you never know
The life that was a happy song has ended much too soon
And I'm alone on our second honeymoon
I look around the room and see you standing everywhere
The fragrance of your bridal flowers seems to fill the air
The blushing bride that gave me such a free and eager kiss
Two loving arms around me as you offered wedded bliss
We'd said that we'd return to live it over in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon
More Of Old Golden Throat


"I'll Remember You"
I'll remember you
Long after this endless summer has gone
I'll be lonely oh so lonely
Living only to remember you
I'll remember too
Your voice as soft as the warm summer breeze
Your sweet laughter, mornings after
Ever after, I'll remember you
To your arms someday I'll return to stay
Till then I will remember too
Every bright start we made wishes upon
Love me always, promise always
Oooh, youll remember too
More Of Old Golden Throat


"Wabash Blues"
Oh, those Wabash Blues
I know I got my dues
A lonesome soul am I
I feel that I could die
Candle light that gleams
Taunts me in my dreams
I'll pack my walking shoes
To lose those Wabash Blues


"Lorena"
The years creep slowly by, lorena
The snow is on the grass again
The sun's low down the sky, lorena
The frost gleams where the flowers have been
But my heart beats on as warmly now
As when the summer days were nigh
The sun can never dip so low
Or down affections cloudless sky
A hundred months have passed, lorena
Since last I held that hand in mine
And felt the pulse beat fast, lorena
Though mine beat faster far than thine
A hundred months, 'twas flowery may
When up the hilly slope we climbed
To watch the dying of the day
And hear the distant church bells chime
We loved each other then, lorena
More than we ever dared to tell
And what we might have been, lorena
Had but our lovings prospered well
But then, 'tis past, the years are gone
I'll not call up their shadowy forms
I'll say to them
lost years, sleep on
Sleep on
The story of that past, lorena
Alas
The hopes that could not last, lorena
They lived, but only lived to cheat
I would not cause e'en one regret
To rankle in your bosom now
For
if we try, we may forget
Were words of thine long years ago
Yes, these were words of thine, lorena
They burn within my memory yet
They touched some tender chords, lorena
Which thrill and tremble with regret
twas not thy woman's heart that spoke
Thy heart was always true to me
A duty, stern and pressing, broke
The tie which linked my soul with thee
It matters little now, lorena
The past is in the eternal past
Our heads will soon lie low, lorena
Life's tide is ebbing out so fast
There is a future
Of life this is so small a part
tis dust to dust beneath the sod
But there, up there, 'tis heart to heart
America: A 200


"Roll Call"
To Annabel in Memphis it was just another day
But her sweetheart and his buddies died ten thousand miles away
A captain sadly walked the muddy bloody battlefield
The smoke had cleared away and it was terrible and still
In his pocket was a roster of the falling fighting men
And the captain had his orders so the roll call begin
Atkins Baker Carter Calahan Clement Jones Johnson Moran
McCoy Perkins Rivers and Revere Stepherd Thomas Wilson what can of you here
The roll call was completed but no sign of life was there
Not one man had answered not one accounted for
He turned around and he walked away and looked up to the sky
When he heard his own voice echo and the answer from on high
Atkins (here) Baker (here) Carter (here) Calahan (here)
Clement (here) Jones (here) Johnson (here) Moran (here)
McCoy (here) Perkins (here) Rivers (here) and Revere (here)
Stepherd (here) Thomas (here) Wilson (yes sir we're all here)
We are present sir and all accounted for


"Southwind"
Southwind
You picked her up in Jacksonville
And left me cold and lonesome in the rain
South
You took her off to Nashville
Left me chokin' in the smoke behind the train
And you go whoooo
She's gone a
Southwind
I need a forty
And about this time tomorrow I'll be gone
Southwind
But if I had forty dollars
I would by myself a smile to carry on
And you go whoooo
She's gone again on the Southwind
Southwind
Take her fast and take her far
Cause that's the way she always likes to go
Southwind
I will be waitin' for the round trip
If you'll bring her back and I done told her so
Don't you go whoooo
She's gone again on the Southwind


"Devil To Pay"
Go on girl take your chances
See how long you can go on from man to man
I can read the lines between your stolen glances
And I know it's time to fold this loosing hand
Cause you're drawn to the flame by the thrill and the shame
Of the cheatin' game they taught you how to play
You've got nothing to lose but your soul girl
And you've only the devil to pay
You've been flying so high you don't know
That you're blind to the writin' on the wall
But some day you'll look down
And you'll find you've got no place to fall
When the bright lights're gone you'll be standing alone
Forsaken in the naked light of day
Then you'll know that it's all over but the dying
And you've still got the devil to pay
Join your friends while you got 'em
Cause you know they're gettin' fewer every day
You can't wait to let them take you to the bottom
And I'm gettin' tired of standin' in your way
But when you hit the ground don't come looking around
For the pieces of the love you threw away
That's the price of the high life you're livin'
And you still got the devil to pay
You've been flying so high you don't know
That you're blind to the writin' on the wall
But some day you'll look down
And you'll find you've got no place to fall
When the bright lights're gone you'll be standing alone
Forsaken in the naked light of day
Then you'll know that it's all over but the dying
And you've still got the devil to pay


"Cause I Love You"
I'll sweep out your chimney
yes and, I will bring you flowers
yes and, I will do for you
Most anything you want me to
If we live in a cottage
You will feel like it's a castle
By the royal way you're treated
And attention shown to you
I'll be there beside you
If you need a cryin shoulder
Yes, and I'll be there to listen
When you need to talk to me
When you wake up in the darkness
I will put my arms around you
And hold you till the mornin sun
Comes shinin' through the trees
I'll be right beside you
No matter where you travel
I'll be there to cheer you
Till the sun comes shinin through
If we're ever parted
I will keep the tie that binds us
And I'll never let it break
Cause I love you
I will bring you honey
From the bee tree in the meadow
And the first time there's a rainbow
I'll bring you a pot of gold
I'll take all your troubles
And I'll throw 'em in the river
Then I'll bundle down beside you
And I'll keep you from the cold
I'll be right beside you
No matter where you travel
I'll be there to cheer you
Till the sun comes shinin through
If we're ever parted
I will keep the tie that binds us
And I'll never let it break
Cause I love you
I Walk The Line


"See Ruby Fall"
Well I knew someday, Ruby would be leavin'
That she wasn't happy livin' quietly, quietly
Cause she would get the bedroom look each mornin'
And I felt Ruby pull away from me
Yeah, so go downtown about nine o'clock this evening
Walk under that red light and down the hall, down the hall
Look for the highest flyin' girl, that's Ruby
And if you wait your turn you'll see Ruby fall
Don't let her know that you even know me
She'll be tryin' to forget it all
And don't tell me how is was tonight, tomorrow
Cause I don't want to see Ruby fall
I didn't hold her back, when she got restless
One man is not enough when she wants it all
Yeah, I let her go when I saw what she wanted
Cause I don't care to see Ruby fall


"Route No. 1, Box 144"
His dying barely made the morning paper
And they summed it up in twenty words or more
Killed in action leaves wife and baby
At Route 1 Box 144
He grew up on a little farm just a couple of miles out of town
As a boy he worked in his daddy's field
And when his daddy could spare him
He hired out to the neighbors
For whatever they could pay him
He was thought of as just average a good boy
Nothing more the average amount of friends
He married his high school sweetheart
They brought a little plot of ground
Couple of miles out of town on a mailbox it said
Route 1 Box 144
Well back in town there were very few people that really knew him
Because he hardly ever came to town
Except for maybe on Saturdays of course the usual crew was always there
But he didn't spent a lot of times with the usual crew
He took care of his business
Bought what he had to have or could afford for his family
And went back to his little farm
With a baby on the way he went to the army and it was a short while
That the news came that he was killed in action
His body was sent back on a plane and then by train
And then they brought the body from the train station
To Route 1 Box 144
He never did great things to be remembered
He'd never been away from home before
But you'd've thought that he was president or something
At Route 1 Box 144


"Sing A Traveling Song"
Hey little girl with tears in your eyes
Don't waste your time now asking me why
I don't know I know I'll be moving along
You say that home is where my love is at
I said that home is where I hang my head
The time has come to sing a traveling song
You want a house and a lot of close friends
I love the feel of my back to the wind
The two won't match you know the cage they wile would be wrong
You think that love is friends a child and a home
You can't buy love on a twenty year alone
The time has come to sing a traveling song
Someday where we sat in your old porch swing
A tamer man may offer you a ring
A man that wants his friends and neighbors a child and a home
Don't waste your tears on love that never could be
What's right for others just ain't right for me
The time has come to sing a traveling song mhmm mhm


"If I Were A Carpenter"
If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway
Would you have my baby
If a tinker were my trade
would you still find me
Carrying the pots I made
Following behind me
Save my love through loneliness
Save my love for sorrow
I'm given you my onliness
Come give your tomorrow
If I worked my hands in wood
Would you still love me
Answer me babe
Yes I would
I'll put you above me
If I were a miller
at a mill wheel grinding
would you miss your color box
and your soft shoe shining
If I were a carpenter
and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway
Would you have my baby
Would you marry anyway
Would you have my baby


"To Beat The Devil"
And I'd like to dedicate this to John and June, who helped show me how to beat the devil
It was winter time in Nashville, down on music city row
And I was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the cold
To warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soul
Keep the chilly wind off my guitar
My thirsty wanted whisky
But it'd been of month of paydays since I'd heard that eagle scream
So with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar
Actually, I guess you'd could call it a Tavern
Cigarette smoke to the ceiling and sawdust on the floor
Friendly shadows
I saw that there was just one old man sittin' at the bar
And in the mirror I could see him checkin' me and my guitar
An' he turned and said
Come up here boy, and show us what you are
I said
I'm dry
He bought me a beer
He nodded at my guitar and said
It's a tough life, ain't it
I just looked at him. He said
You ain't makin' any money, are you
I said
You've been readin' my mail
He just smiled and said
Let me see that guitar
I've got something you oughta hear
Then he laid it on me
If you waste your time a
To the things that you are sayin', who do you think's gonna hear
And if you should die explainin' how the things that they complain about
Are things they could be changin', who do you think's gonna care
There were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind
Who were crucified for what they tried to show
And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time
Cos the truth remains that no
Well, the old man was a stranger, but I'd heard his song before
Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door
When no
And lonesome was more than a state of mind
You see, the devil haunts a hungry man
If you don't wanna join him, you got to beat him
I ain't sayin' I beat the devil, but I drank his beer for nothing
Then I stole his song
And you still can hear me singin' to the people who don't listen
To the things that I am sayin', prayin' someone's gonna hear
And I guess I'll die explaining how the things that they complain about
Are things they could be changin', hopin' someone's gonna care
I was born a lonely singer, and I'm bound to die the same
But I've got to feed the hunger in my soul
And if I never have a nickle, I won't ever die ashamed
Cos I don't believe that no


"Blistered"
I've got great big blisters on my bloodshot
Eyes from looking at that long legged woman up ahead
What she does simply walking down the sidewalk of the city
Makes me think about a stray cat getting fed
He's got a whole lotta motion in her sole, I know
But her sole ain't the place she lets it show
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
Lord I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah
She done tore my sole apart, put big blisters on my heart
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go
I've got great big blisters on my fingertips
From reaching in my pocket book and picking out the bills
And I got tiny white blisters in my throat
From trying to ease my nervous tension taking all them pat and pills
And ever since she started running around from bar to bar
I just can't eat a bite or keep my stomach settled down
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
She done got me, oh yeah
She done tore my soul apart, put big blisters on my heart
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
Oh I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Blistered, blistered


"Wrinkled Crinkled Wadded Dollar Bill"
I've got a lot of blues on my mind
And at least a million miles behind me
And all that I've got between me
And pauper's hill
Is a wrinkled, crincked, wadded dollar bill
Lake Michigan wind sure is cold
And I need me a jacket for my shoulders
I could buy one down at the surplus store
Cheap cotton twill
With my wrinckled crinckled wadded dollar bill
But I'm not bound
And I never will
Be to a wrinkled crinckled wadded dollar bill
It sure smells good at the bakery
And I stand and let the smell flood over me
They sell them day old cakes mighty cheeply
I could eat my fill
With my wrinkled, crinkled wadded dollar bill
But I'm not bound
And I never will
Be to a wrinkled, crinkled wadded dollar bill
Lake Michigan waves hit the beach
And I stand and let them wash at my feet
And then I throw it just as far as I can
Into the chill
My wrinkled, crinkled wadded dollar bill
For I'm not bound
And I never will
Be to a wrinkled crinkled wadded dollar bill
No I'm not bound
And I never will
Be to a wrinkled crinkled wadded dollar bill


"I've Got A Thing About Trains"
Train train train I've got a thing about trains
I get a sad kind of feeling when I see a passenger train
In this fast movin' world that we live in nobody rides 'em much these days
Maybe I'm a little sentimental cause I know that things have to change
But I'd still like to go for a train ride cause I've got a thing about trains
Train train train you're fading from the scene
But you've had your days of glory train train train
Train they say you're too slow for travelin' but I'm gonna miss you some day
When my little boy says daddy what was it like to ride a train
I'll just say it was a good way to travel when things didn't move quite so fast
And I'm sorry son that you can't ride one the trains are the thing of the past
Train train train you're fading from the scene
And I'm gonna mourn your passing train train train
I've got a thing about trains


"Jesus Was A Carpenter"
Jesus was a carpenter and he worked with a sow and a hammer
And his hands could form a table true enough to stand forever
And he might have spun his life out in the coolness of the mornings
But he put aside his tools and he walked the burning highways
To build a house from folks like you and me
And he found them as they wandered through the wild Judean mountains
And he found them as they pulled their nets upon the Sea of Galilee
And for a thousand evenings while the day behind him emptied
He walked among the poor and he stopped to touch the dying
And he built his house from people just like these
It was on a shining Sunday when he rode to old Jerusalem
And the palms they cast before him were the crimes they laid against him
It was on a stormy Friday when he climbed the streets of Calvary
And where he died today why they're sellin' beads and postcards
And they tell us too that that was long ago
But would he stand today upon the sands of California
Or walk the sweating blacktop in New York and Mississippi
Where the mighty churches rise above the screaming cities
Would he be a guest on Sunday a vagrant on a Monday
With the doors locked tight against his kind you know
Come again now Jesus be a carpenter among us
There are chapels in our discontent cathedrals in our sorrows
And we dwell in golden mansions with the sand for our foundations
And the raging water's rising and the thunder's all around us
Won't you come and build a house on rock again
Jesus was a carpenter


"Flesh And Blood"
Beside a Singin' Mountain Stream
Where the Willow grew
Where the Silver Leaf of Maple
Sparkled in the Mornin' Dew
I braided Twigs of Willows
Made a String of Buckeye Beads
But Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
I leaned against a Bark of Birch
And I breathed the Honey Dew
I saw a North
Against a Sky of Baby Blue
Beside the Lily Pads
I carved a Whistle from a Reed
Mother Nature's quite a Lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
A Cardinal sang just for me
And I thanked him for the Song
Then the Sun went slowly down the West
And I had to move along
These were some of the things
On which my Mind and Spirit feed
But Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
[SPOKEN]
So when this Day was ended
I was still not satisfied
For I knew ev'rything I touched
Would wither and would die
And Love is all that will remain
And grow from all these Seed
[SUNG]
Mother Nature's quite a Lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need


"I Walk The Line"
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
At San Quentin
I Walk The Line


"Hungry"
Grit my teeth and face a new day dawning take a deep breath then get up and go
Tie the same old weary shoes and walk the same old pathway
I never see a face that I don't know oh God if I could just pack up and go
Hungry for some other face hungry for some other place
Needin' something and I know what God I know what
I'm tired of seein' the same old road tired of carryin' the same old load
Hungry for something I ain't got
Her face across that table every morning and lately I don't notice that she's there
Always leave that breakfast table feelin' so damned empty
She knows there's something wrong but I don't care
Oh God how much more of this can I bear


"This Town"
This Town
This town is not for me
I won't be stayin' 'round
This town is hard and cold
I'm not happy in this town
I'll pick up my heart and I'll go
Where to I don't care or know
Don't matter where I'll be found
As long as I leave this town
This town wants me to go
It ain't where I was bound
This town don't need me here
I don't need this town
To morrow who'll remember my name
To morrow who'll remember I came
Don't care which road I'll go down
As long as it's a way from this town


"This Side Of The Law"
This Side of the Law
On this side of the law
On that side of the law
Who is right
Who is weak
Who is for and who
You see, I didn't really mean and harm
But I simply couldn't make it on the farm
When the land won't give a lot
You gotta do with what you got
And all I got's the muscle in my arm
Well, I wouldn't ever hurt my fellow man
And it seems to me that you could under stand
I'm just tryin' to help my self without hurtin' somebody else
And a man has got to do the best he can
On this side of the law
On that side of the law
Who is right
Who is weak
Who is for and who's against the law
Well, I didn't mean to let my fam'ly down
And I'm not giving you the run a round
I'd much rather be dead than have to beg my daily bread
And to pay my way no matter where I'm bound
Well, I didn't really think that I did wrong
So long as I stayed here where I belong
I did the only thing I could
Same as anybody would
And I was simply trying to get along
On this side of the law
On that side of the law
Who is right
Who is weak
Who is for and who's against the law

"Face Of Despair"
Fingers callus from the plough wrinkled weather beatin' brow
Streak of silver in the hair mhm face of despair
A back that's bent from years of toil thorns grow in the worn out soil
No one left to really care nhm face of despair
If you should plough old fields like these you'd plough up memories
Don't tell the young to mend their ways you can't show them better days
Their better days are yet ahead your better days have long been dead
Rest easy in your rocking chair mhm and look at your September country
Face of despair
Shoulders weary from the load life is rough as a gravel road
How much of it can you bear mhm look at your September country face of despair
In the September of your years eyes that hide a veil of tears
A look of longing always there mhm face of despair
If you should plough
Mhm if you should plough


"Standing On The Promise"
(Standing on the promises of Christ my King through eternal ages let his praises ring
Glory in the highest I will shout and sing
Standing on the promises of God
Standing standing standing on the promises of God my Saviour
Standing standing I'm standing on the promises of God)


"Amazing Grace"
Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed
When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we'd first begun


"The Preacher Said Jesus Said"
Well with everybody tryin' to tell us what to do
You wonder how are you to know whose word is true
But the preacher just keep on a bringing us a very same word
And from St Paul to Billy Graham the same is heard
And the preacher said of truth Jesus said
(And Jesus said I'm the way the truth and the life)
Well we can see that the world is full of greed
There's so much hate yet there is so much need
What should we do when no one seems to care
What can we do when there is no love there
And then the preacher said of love Jesus said
(Jesus said love Thy neighbor as Thyself)
Well please tell us the road we oughta go in such confusion how are we to know
And if there is a heaven show us to its gates
Oh you'd better tell us preacher before it's too late
And then the preacher said of heaven Jesus said
(Jesus said seek the first the kingdom of God and his righteousness
And all these things shall be added unto you)
Well please tell us we can find a way to climb every mountain that we face every day
And time of troubles what to depend upon to be the truth and help us carry on
And the preacher said of trouble Jesus said
(Jesus said let not your heart be troubled if you believe in God believe also in me
In my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you
I go to prepare a place for you
And if I prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself
That where I am there you may be also)


"Orphan Of The Road"
From a carny show and a rodeo that shared a three
A cowboy met a fiery carny queen
In new spring nights amid the lights of the painted carny van
They laughed and loved and shared short
But the carny show and the rodeo went their separate ways
And the carny season bloomed and soon moved on
And I was born on a winter morn to the dark
The too
The black
Unwanted son of ice and fire, an orphan of the road
I was still a child when my mama died of a chill that closed her eyes
So I was left to grow up on my own
Without a name, too wild to tame. No one cared to try
So mostly I was mostly left alone
In dingy bars and cold boxcars, hobo jungle camps
I joined the men who drift from town to town
The surgin' flood of restless blood flowed inside my veins
I'd never find the time to settle down
The black
In the misty rain, I caught the train that slowed down through the town
And I pulled myself into the boxcar door
In a passing light in the deep gray night, I saw the still dark form
Of an old man lying sick upon the floor
And he said
I tried to find her, but they told me that she'd died
And that she'd left an only son behind
And I tried to find him, but I never did, but I know I could rest in peace
If I could just see him once before I die
I found a match and I quickly scratched it into a flicker and flame
Then I held it close and I gently raised his head
My mother, sir
I said of her
I have her same dark eyes
He smiled a cowboy smile and then was dead
The black


"You've Got A New Light Shining In Your Eyes"
You've got a new light shining in your eyes
And I can see now right where your beauty lies
And it's showin' in your face that your heart has found a place
And I can hear it in your whisper and your sighs
You've got a new way of doing things you do
And it's plain to see there's been a change in you
And I wonder could it be that the change is due to me
For I have felt a certain something too
You've got a way about you now that you never had before
You've got a look you're wearin' now like no look you ever wore
I tried to hide it for a while but now I realize
You've got a new light shining in your eyes
You've got a way about you now that you never had before
You've got a look you're wearin' now like no look you ever wore
I tried to hide it for a while but now I realize
You've got a new light shining in your eyes
You've got a new light shining in your eyes


"If Not For Love"
A broken man moves slowly down the sidewalk
Humbled by the favours he must seek
From those that he encounters on his walk through misery
Who are rich enough to hurt just as they please
If not for love I could be one of these
An old man on a park bench stares with envy
At a couple with their children on their knees
While across the park a young man is caught by the police
Stealin' for a habit he must feed
And if not for love I could be one of these
I could be one of these or so many many more
Always at the beck and call of shame
I'm thankful I was called by love to walk among the happy
But if not for you love wouldn't know my name
A man of squander talents vainly calls on
His gift of God now straining through his soul
While in the crowd before him a jealous friend awaits
The moments that he can no longer please
And if not for love I could be one of these
I could be one of these or so many many more
Always at the beck and call of shame
I'm thankful I was called by love to walk among the happy
But if not for you love wouldn't know my name
Yes if not for love I could be one of these


"The Man In Black"
Well, you wonder why I always dress in black
Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on
I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who is long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the times
I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me
Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a Man In Black
I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men
And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believin' that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believin' that we all were on their side
Well, there's things that never will be right I know
And things need changin' everywhere you go
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white
Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that everything's okay
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back
Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black


"Singin' In Vietnam Talkin' Blues"
One mornin' at breakfast, I said to my wife
We been everywhere once and some places twice
As I had another helping of country ham
She said
We ain't never been to Vietnam
And there's a bunch of our boys over there
So we went to the Orient: Saigon
Well we got a big welcome when we drove in
Through the gates of a place that they call Long Vinh
We checked in and everything got kinda quiet
But a soldier boy said
Just wait 'til tonight
Things get noisy. Things start happenin'
Big bad firecrackers
Well that night we did about four shows for the boys
And they were livin' it up with a whole lot of noise
We did our last song for the night
And we crawled into bed for some peace and quiet
But things weren't peaceful. And things weren't quiet
Things were scary
Well for a few minutes June never said one word
And I thought at first that she hadn't heard
Then a shell exploded not two miles away
She sat up in bed and I heard her say
What was that
I said
That was a shell, or a bomb
She said
I'm scared
I said
Me too
Well all night long that noise kept on
And the sound would chill you right to the bone
The bullets and the bombs, and the mortar shells
Shook our bed every time one fell
And it never let up
Before it got any better
Well when the sun came up, the noise died down
We got a few minutes sleep, an' we were sleepin' sound
When a soldier knocked on our door and said
Last night they brought in seven dead, and 14 wounded
And would we come down to the base hospital, and see the boys
Yes
So we went to the hospital ward by day
And every night we were singin' away
Then the shells and the bombs was goin' again
And the helicopters brought in the wounded men
Night after night
Comin' and a goin'
So we sadly sang for them our last song
And reluctantly we said
So long
We did our best to let 'em know that we care
For every last one of 'em that's over there
Whether we belong over there or not
Somebody over here love's 'em, and needs 'em
Well now that's about all that there is to tell
About that little trip into livin' hell
And if I ever go back over there any more
I hope there's none of our boys there for me to sing for
I hope that war is over with
And they all come back home
To stay
In peace


"Ned Kelly"
In Australia a bandit or an outlaw was called a bushranger
One of Australia's most infamous bushrangers was a man named Ned Kelly
Ned Kelly was a wild young bushranger
Out of Victoria he rode with his brother Dan
He loved his people and he loved his freedom
And he loved to ride the wide open land
Ned Kelly was a victim of the changes
That came when his land was a sprout and seed
And the wrongs he did were multiplied in legend
With young Australia growing like a weed
Ned Kelly took the blame
Ned Kelly won the fame
Ned Kelly brought the shame
And then Ned Kelly hanged
Well he hid out in the bush and in the forest
And he loved to hear the wind blow in the trees
While the men behind the badge were coming for him
Ned said they'll never bring me to my knees
But everything was changed and run in cycles
And Ned knew that his day was at an end
He made a suit of armour out of ploughshares
But Ned was brought down by the trooper's men
Ned Kelly took the blame
Ned Kelly won the fame
Ned Kelly brought the shame
And then Ned Kelly hanged


"Look For Me"
Look for me there in the morning
When the clay of worthless ground
Is baked into the brick to build the church
That doesn't mind to wait with patience till it's found
He said children look for me look for me
Look for me late in the evening when the honey bear is lost
And hears a buzz of honey bees that leads him on and feeds him
Till his hunger feels at home he said children look for me look for me
Look for me look for me love will be there beside you
Love will be there to guide you look for me
He said help me to help you to help yourself to me
He said children look for love look for me
Look for me there in the hand
That drops a penny in the cup
And in the hand that lends its strength
To help the lonely through the night and lift the beggar up
He said children look for me look for me
Look for me there in the chill of dawn and in the newborn eyes
Of a baby left discarded by a girl we could offer nothing more
Than a small back alley prayer he said children look for me look for me
Look for me look for me love will be there beside you
Love will be there to guide you look for me
He said help me to help you to help yourself to me
He said children look for love look for me


"Dear Mrs"
Dear Mrs though we've never met I know very much about you
I know that you've got hair that shines like the morning sun
You've got eyes that hold the blueness of the sky
And of the deepest sea on a clear day and a smile that has a sparkle of a diamond
I know that because I've heard him say those things about you
These're the thoughts and the words of a man
Who spent many heart breaking years behind prison walls
The father of your children the man who worshipped the very ground that you walk on
He had a picture of you Mrs it was old and faded and torn
But you could tell at a glance that he never exaggerated in his thoughts and visions
He never left his cell without first checking to see if he had your picture with him
He was a young man when he first came to prison
And he talked a great deal about you but as the years passed he talked less and less
And during his last year here I don't believe he ever said a word to anybody
He had the appearance of a man much older than he really was
He walked with his head down and his shoulders saggin'
And the walk itself seemed to take a great deal of effort
He never received a letter or had a visitor while he was here in prison
But never did he stop looking and waitin'
Every day at mail call you could see him standing close to his bars
With the look of a child awaiting a reward
Even after the mailman had passed his cell his pleading eyes would follow beggin'
As always he'd feel of his shirt pocket and then just stand there
Staring at the emptiness and as always I could
Somehow feel the lump in his throat
And the burning in his eyes you know Mrs like just before you start to cry
Well I thought you might like to know that they buried his body today
Just outside the prison walls
They buried him there because nobody cared enough to claim his body
You know there was even a couple of old convicts there that actually cried
No not because they cared for him but for what he died from they cared for
Loneliness every prisoner knows loneliness but some know it more than others
The man that they buried today had died many times
Every day he waited hopin' and prayin' for a letter or a card
Or just a note or anything to let him know that somewhere out there
Somebody cared for him
That assurance never came and today he died Mrs
He died from loneliness starved for love a love that nobody ever wanted
You see no man woman or child is immune to the need of love or to be loved
No matter how terrible his crime might have been
The death he died from today was more inhuman
But his suffering is over now and he's resting in a pauper's grave in a prison suit
And in his pocket is an old torn and faded picture of yes of you Mrs


"I Talk To Jesus Every Day"
Well you talk about important people that you say you know
Presidents and superstars of big television shows
Well I know someone personally who's bigger than 'em all
And next to him your superstars look mighty small
And I have a talk with him each day and he's interested in every word I say
No secretary ever tells me he's been called away I talk to Jesus every day
Well now I don't think that I'll ever be in any Hall of Fame
And the social register of wealthy folks might drop my name
But my name is written in the book of life I'm proud to say
And that's all that really matters anyway
And I talk to Jesus every day and he's interested in every word I say
No secretary ever tells me he's been called away I talk to Jesus every day
I talk to Jesus every day


"Opening Dialogue"
[Dialogue:]
We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union
Had to have men like Columbus, De Soto, Lewis and Clark, Kit Carson, Daniel Boone, David Crockett, Eli Whitney, Sam Colt, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Orville and Wilbur Wright, my grandpa, and Paul Revere


"Paul Revere"
In April of 1775
This great nation started comin' alive
Ol' King George didn't like it one bit
So he proceeded to throw him a royal fit
He told his generals better get 'em back in line
Make 'em pay my taxes now America is mine
Stop that Independence cops before it gets around
Or it'll gonna be hard to hold them rebels down
Well the King was talking bout the men like Paul Revere
And the minute men who held their dream of Independence dear
They kept their eyes on the British they watched 'em day and night
They knew very soon they'd get their chance to stand and fight
Yes they knew that the British would get movin' any hour
So they arranged a signal in the Northern Church Tower
Paul was watchin' when the tower showed a light
And he started on his midnight ride
He jumped on his horse hoofs started a hummin'
He screamed out his warning redcoats're comin'
Better get your guns and your fightin' britches on
They're comin' and they're eight hundred strong
Next mornin' at Concord and Lexington town
The spirit of freedom turned the redcoats around
When we praise the men who made this mighty nation we have here
Then let's remember Paul Revere yes let's remember Paul Revere
I guarantee you somethin' and I wanna tell you all
That we never would've been here if it hadn't been for Paul
Yes sir I surely doubt us ever bein' here
If it hadn't been for that man on that horse named Mr Revere


"Begin West Movement"
1776 the thirteen colonies
Broke away from British rule and took a stand
We're on our own
they said
And they looked across the land
With a defiant challenge
They looked across the land
We will conquer you
the colonists said
We see your mighty mountains
We know of your lush green valleys
We're comin' to claim you, to tame you
And the 'Movement Westward' started


"The Road To Kaintuck"
We're goin' west to Kaintuck down the road to Moccasin Gap
Down the wilderness road
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap
There was a time when goin' way out west meant goin' to Kaintuck
The dark and bloody ground as Indians called it
Indians wars were ragin' and men like Daniel Boone and Michael Stoner
Came down the wilderness road like countless families did
Through a place in south West Virginia called Big Moccasin Gap
It's a hot day in '73 and this is my wife and my kids with me
Daniel Boone lost his boy the other day young Jim Boone is dead twenty miles away
The wagons turn and went back home even Daniel couldn't make it alone
I guess prob'ly Daniel could but he stopped awhile in castle wood
(If you love your wife and love your baby man
Turn your wagons back as soon as you can
Ev'ry Injun in these hills has gone berserk you never gonna make it to Kaintuck)
Ah I bet I'm gonna make it to Kaintuck
We're goin' west to Kaintuck down the road to Moccasin Gap
Down the wilderness road
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap
America: A 200


"To The Shining Mountains"
Yes, went they through the Lehigh Valley
To Lake Erie past Virginia
And the land called out its challenge
Bring your men to match our mountains
See the green Ohio Valley
See the Cumberland, the Wabash
On the Tennessee they floated
On great rafts to the Mississippi
And the Cherokee and Shawnee
And the Creek and The Ojibwa
And the Choctaw and the Quapaw
And all the tribes along the rivers
that they were coming
That the white man was upon them
They built their homes along the rivers
Built their churches, brought their preachers
Came upon the white misery
Stopped before the shining mountains
Many died from the beginning
For the freedom of America
Like that day down in New Orleans


"The Battle Of New Orleans"
In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in the town of New Orleans
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin' on
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
We looked down the river and we see'd the British come
And there must have been a hundred of'em beatin' on the drum
They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring
We stood by our cotton bales and didn't say a thing
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin' on
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
If we didn't fire our muskets 'til we looked 'em in the eye
We held our fire 'til we see'd their faces well
Then we opened up with squirrel guns and really gave 'em ... well
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin' on
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin' on
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico


"Remember The Alamo"
And a hundred and eighty were challenged by Travis to die
By the line that he drew with his sword when the battle was nigh
Any man that would fight to the death crossed over
But him that would live, better fly
And over the line went a hundred and seventy nine
Hey Santa Anna, we're killing your soldiers below
That men, wherever they go will remember the Alamo
Bowie lay dying, but his powder was ready and dry
Flat on his back, Bowie killed him a few in reply
And young David Crockett was singing and laughing
With gallantry fears in his eyes
For God and for freedom, a man more than willing to die
Hey Santa Anna, we're killing your soldiers below
That men, wherever they go will remember the Alamo
And then they sent a young scout from the battlements, bloody and loud
With the words of farewell from a garrison valiant and proud
Grieve not little darling, my dying, if Texas is sovereign and free
We'll never surrender and ever with liberty be
Hey Santa Anna, we're killing your soldiers below
That men, wherever they go will remember the Alamo


"Opening The West"
And the shining Rocky Mountains looked down on the people coming
Strong and sturdy freedom lovin' settlers cowboys pioneers
Now no foreign crown would rule them
Now a nation strong was standing even bigger was it growing
Added Iowa, Wisconsin then broke through the shining mountains
Staked a claim on California
Panned the gold out of its rivers irrigated desert valleys
Oregon, Minnesota, Kansas now were added to the total
Making 34 to number of the States now in the Union
And the years 1860 to 65 the history books're full of it
The sadness the heartbreak and the songs of that period
Tell us of a sadness and of a heartbreak when the nation was torn asunder


"Lorena"
The years creep slowly by, lorena
The snow is on the grass again
The sun's low down the sky, lorena
The frost gleams where the flowers have been
But my heart beats on as warmly now
As when the summer days were nigh
The sun can never dip so low
Or down affections cloudless sky
A hundred months have passed, lorena
Since last I held that hand in mine
And felt the pulse beat fast, lorena
Though mine beat faster far than thine
A hundred months, 'twas flowery may
When up the hilly slope we climbed
To watch the dying of the day
And hear the distant church bells chime
We loved each other then, lorena
More than we ever dared to tell
And what we might have been, lorena
Had but our lovings prospered well
But then, 'tis past, the years are gone
I'll not call up their shadowy forms
I'll say to them
lost years, sleep on
Sleep on
The story of that past, lorena
Alas
The hopes that could not last, lorena
They lived, but only lived to cheat
I would not cause e'en one regret
To rankle in your bosom now
For
if we try, we may forget
Were words of thine long years ago
Yes, these were words of thine, lorena
They burn within my memory yet
They touched some tender chords, lorena
Which thrill and tremble with regret
twas not thy woman's heart that spoke
Thy heart was always true to me
A duty, stern and pressing, broke
The tie which linked my soul with thee
It matters little now, lorena
The past is in the eternal past
Our heads will soon lie low, lorena
Life's tide is ebbing out so fast
There is a future
Of life this is so small a part
tis dust to dust beneath the sod
But there, up there, 'tis heart to heart
America: A 200


"The Gettysburg Address"
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate


"The West"
Then came West Virginia came Nevada and Nebraska
Colorado and Dakota, Washington, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming
And the West was opened up
And for ther first time it seems
That the nation was really conscious of itself as a nation
Railroad tracks crossed the land as did telegraph wires
Public opinion and great ideas were now reflected on a national basis
And never in this land before us and never more hereafter
Will a land know such a people as a man we call a cowboy
His hat and his bandana his unique brand of lingo
All his devil deeds of daring bold and skillful in the saddle
Brave and daring in the rambling wild and eager in exploring
Land that calls him with a challenge
But the land was already claimed by a people
When the cowboy came and when the soldiers came
The story of the American Indian is in a lot of ways a story of tragedy
Like that day at Wounded Knee South Dakota


"Big Foot"
But the land was already claimed by a people when the cowboy came and when the soldiers came
The story of the American Indian is in a lot of ways a story of tragedy
like that day at Wounded Knee, South Dakota
Big Foot was an Indian chief
Of the Minneconjou band
A band of Minneconjou Sioux
From South Dakota land
Big Foot said to Custer
Stay away from Crazy Horse
But Custer crossed into Sioux land
And he never came back across
Then Big Foot led his people
To a place called Wounded Knee
And they found themselves surrounded
By the 7th Cavalry
Big chief Big Foot
Rise up from your bed
Minneconjou babies cry
For their mothers lying dead
Big Foot was down with a fever
When he reached Wounded Knee
And his people all were prisoners
Of the 7th Cavalry
Two hundred women and children
And another hundred men
Raised up a white flag of peace
But peace did not begin
An accidental gunshot
And Big Foot was first to die
And over the noise of the rifles
You could hear the babies cry
Big chief Big Foot
It's good that you can't see
Revenge is being wrought
By Custer's 7th Cavalry
Then smoke hung over the canyon
On that cold December day
All was death and dying
Around where Big Foot lay
Farther on up the canyon
Some had tried to run and hide
But death showed no favorites
Women, men, and children died
One side called it a
massacre
The other a
victory
But the white flag is still waving
Today at Wounded Knee
Big chief Big Foot
Your Minneconjou band
Is more than remembered here
In South Dakota land


"Like A Young Colt"
Like a young cold the country was now growing fast
Passenger trains in the east were traveling a hundred miles an hour
People in the country could buy clothes by mail order
And get 'em back within two weeks
After twenty years or more the South
Was still mending its wounds from the civil war
But with all the country's problems
The union was solid
Red American novelists and poets
Were coming into their own
People were expressing their love
For America in song and in poem
And in South Carolina
A high tone southern gentleman
Expressed his love and admiration
For his president James A Garfield in such a way


"Mister Garfield"
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Me and my brother was down close to the depot when I heard the report of a pistol
My brother run out and come back in all excited
And I said what was it and he said it was the report of a pistol and then he said
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Lord I knew the President was supposed to be at the depot that day
And we just would't believe that he's shot
But we'd run over there and there was so many folks around
That we couldn't see him but some lady was standin' there cryin'
And I said m'am what was it that happened m'am and she said
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Well everybody drifted off toward home finally
And they looked like they felt about as bad as I did
But in a few weeks I heard that the President was still alive
And I told my brother I said let's get on that train and go to where he's laid up hurt
Well when we got to his big house up there I asked the fellow
I said who was it that did it who was it that shoot the President
And he said it was Charlie Guiteau that shoot Mr. Garfield and I said
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man good man
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man low
I heard some fellow there that had been in the house to see the President
And I sidled up him to listen to what he was tellin' and he said
Mrs Lucretia Garfield was always at his side
In the heat of the day fannin' him when he was hot
He said that just that day the President said to Mrs Lucretia
He said Crete honey (he called her Crete)
Said if somethin' worse happens to me after awhile you get yourself a good man
And Mrs Lucretia said James (she called him James)
She said I won't hear to that now she said I love you too much but he said
You'll make some good man a good wife good wife
You'll make some man a good good good wife
(Don't pull in single harness all your life good gal
Don't pull in single harness all your life)
That's what he said don't pull in single harness all your life
Well a few days later I come back to where the President was restin'
And it seems everybody was cryin'
The flag was hangin' halfway up to the flagpole in front of the house
And everybody looked so sad and I asked a soldier boy there
And I said is is is Mr. Garfield and he said yeah he's gone
Gonna lay him in that cold lonesome ground down low
Gonna lay him in that cold lonesome ground
Well they laid the President by that long cold branch Mr. Garfield's been laid down low
Mr. Garfield has been shot dow Mr. Garfield's been shot
(Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low)


"A Proud Land"
Then came Utah, Oklahoma, New Mexico was 47
48 was Arizona and the land was all a Union
Now a proud strong land swelled its chest and kept on growing
She survived many wars but now the great war the war to all the wars
Dealth her a stunning blow
Two million men shipped overseas to help win the great war


"The Big Battle"
I think sir the battle is over, and the young soldier lay down his gun
I'm tired of running for cover, I'm certain the battle is done
For see over there where we fought them, it's quiet for they've all gone away
All left is the dead and the dying, the blue lying long side the grave
So you think the battle is over, and you even lay down your gun
You carelessly rise from your cover, for you think the battle is done
Now boy hit the dirt, listen to me, for I'm still the one in command
Get flat on the ground here beside me, and lay your heart to the sand
Can you hear the deafening rumble, can you feel the trembling ground
It's not just the horses and wagons that make such a deafening sound
For every shot fired had an echo and every man killed wanted life
There lies your friend Jim McKinney, can you take the news to his wife
No son the battle's not over, the battle has only begun
The rest of the battle will cover the part that has blackened the sun
The fight yet to come is not with cannon, nor will the fight be hand
No one will regroup the forces, no charge will a general command
The battle will rage in the bosom of mother and sweetheart and wife
Brother and sister and daughter will grieve for the rest of their lives
Now go ahead, rise from your cover, be thankful that God let you live
Go fight the rest of the battle for those who gave all they could give
I see sir the battle's not over, the battle has only begun
The rest of the battle will cover this part that has blackened the sun
For though there's no sound of the cannon and though there's no smoke in the sky
I'm dropping the gun and the saber and ready for battle am I


"On Wheels And Wings"
Now the nation moved on wheels
Will Rogers said we hold the distinction on being the only nation
In the history of the world ever to go to the poorhouse in an automobile
Ha ha ha well the country went to the poorhouse all right
Then it got back to its feet
To become the mose powerful nation in the history of the world


"Come Take A Trip On My Airship"
Come take a trip in my airship come take a trip round the stars
Come take a sail around Venus come take a sail around Mars
No one to watch while we're kissing no one to see while we spoon
Come take a trip in my airship we'll visit the Man in the Moon


"Reaching For The Stars"
Add Alaska and Hawaii make the total half a hundred
Half a hundred states united joined together as one body
Arms that reach across the northland to the far off state Alaska
Arms that reach across the water to the far off state Hawaii
Arms of some two hundred million
Thanking God for having brought us safely thus far in our journey
We're reaching for the stars that beckon reaching for the stars that call us
And we answer back still louder by the power of God that brought us
We are reaching we are reaching reaching for the stars tomorrow


"These Are My People"
These are my people this is the land where my forefathers lie
These are my people in brotherhood we're heirs of a creed to live by
A creed that proclaims that by loved ones blood stains
This is my land and these are my people
These are my people they were born on and lived by the land
These are my people and their cities were raised by hard working hands
And their faces to tell that they're holding on well
To this their land yes these are my people
These are my people these are the ones who will reach for the stars
These are my people that a light of the earth you can tell they are ours
A new step to take and a new day will break
For this my land yes these are my people these're my people hmm


"Narration"
Silent Night
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
That means Christmas to some people
A lot of people from different parts of the country and all over the world
Have different ways of celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ
The prophets of old had foretold of his comin' for four thousand years
And a lot of people say that the wise men from the East were probably astronomers
That may have studied the stars and knew that the new star that was gonna
To appear in the East the time of it was at hand
A lot of others of course say that they were told by God
That the star was about to appear so they could begin their long journey
From the East and where was the East
Some people say it could have been India some people speculate
That one of the wise men came from as far away as Korea all away cross Asia
And he must have been a comin' for many months maybe
Maybe even years to get to the place where that new star
That was to hang over that manger in the town of Bethlehem
Ten miles from Jerusalem
Whatever the shepherds came in from the fields
And you know it's really somethin' that a shepherd would leave his flock
To come in for anything because that was really about a crime for a man to do
That was shepherd to leave his flock of sheep
And come in for anything because the sheep were man's lively hood
The milk and the meat and the wool for the clothing
It really took something for a shepherd to leave a flock
And there were a lot of 'em that did it and came in to worship the new baby Jesus That was born in the manger
The wise men came bearing gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh
And they brought them and laid them at the foot of the manger where Jesus lay
And you know the voice of God so the scriptures say
According to the scriptures had been silent for four hundred years
There had not been a divinely inspired prophet for four hundred years
And all of a sudden you can imagine what kind of night it must have been
For a new star to suddenly appear out of the heavens
And shepherds to leave their flock and men
Wealthy lookin' strangers come in from the East
And all of a sudden on top of all that a heavenly choir to start to singin'
Singin' voices from heaven,singing words that they understood
Words like peace on Earth good will to men


"King Of Love"
He wants to own your heart
He already owns your soul
No matter what you do
He's always in control
And when he calls your name you have to follow
Like moths into a flame, no fear or sorrow will fall upon you
You belong to the King of Love
He wants to know your thoughts
He already knows your mind
No matter where you are
You're someone he'll always find
His very mention brings the slightest shudder
Deep inside you know there is no other as skilled and tender
Just surrender to the King of Love
But when the night falls down, he will not wear a crown
No jewels upon his hands, he is just a man
He wants to rule your world
He already rules your dreams
No matter what you want
He'll never make you Queen
Still when he calls your name you have to answer
And when his music plays you are a dancer for him the only
Never lonely, King of Love
For him the only, never lonely, King of Love

That's a night we are celebratin' at Christmas time
And according to Marshall Grant up in Flatts,North Carolina
They had their own way of celebratin' Christmas too
Marshall what did you get for Christmas say when you were six years old
[Marshall]
When I was six years old or there about the biggest present that I could ever remember gettin'
Was somethin' like a little hatchet or a french harp
I remember one year that I got a hatchet and Odell got a french harp
And he wanted my hatchet and I didn't want his french harp
But he got what he wanted and everythin' but there was fourteen of us
In that little house up in Flatts North Carolina
There was one thing that we did have and at that time of year and that was love
All of us loved one another and it was cold
Always cold with the little fireplace but the room felt so warm
And it was really warm even though there was a lot of scrambling
Over the gifts that we got swappin' back'erds and forth
From all the brothers and sisters
It was really warm in Flatts North Carolina always on Christmas
[Johnny]
I think probably a lot of people might wonder as I did where is Flatts North Carolina
[Marshall]
Well I tell you Flatts North Carolina it's about eighty miles from Ashville
And you go through Cherokee and Brison City
And you get to a little place called Maddy Hill in North Carolina
[June]
But that ain't it
[Marshall]
No
[Johnny]
Then you go up the wind
[Marshall]
You take a little left there at Maddy Hill if you're goin' east
And you go up the windin' stairs for fourteen miles and you round about a dozen bends
And all of a sudden, there is no sign, and if you ask anybody up there
Where Olson Grant lives that's Main Street


"Jingle Bells"
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse sleigh hey
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go laughing all the way(ha ha ha)
Bells on bobtail ring making sprits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Oh Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh Hey
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
You know I hate the cold
That's why I always go
Down south to drink some rum
On a island in the sun
There's nothing like St. Barts
With the palm trees swaying slow
Or being there on Jost Van Dyke
When the New Year comes and goes
Oh jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh hey
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

Both of us gettin' our fingers busted you remember that Tom
Daddy started Christmas mornin' with a stick of dynamite
And he made sure ev'rybody else was up
[Tommy]
When daddy gets up he wants to make sure ev'rybody else in the world is up too

He did when we were kids remember when he could get dynamite bang Joy To The World
[Don:]
What was is like up in the Stanton Virginia about that time of the year Harold
[Harold]
Oh we had I guess about like ev'rybody's Christmas it's always that Christmasy feeling
I remember one year I had an uncle that came in filled with the spirit
And he was lovin' all us kids and ev'rything and we's tryin' to get away from him
And he fell in the Christmas tree and knocked it over
We stood him up in the corner and decorated him
I don't remember what I got that year but I remember what he got
My mama run him out of the house finally


"That Christmasy Feeling"
When the days of December are numbered
And the earth begs it's snowflakes to fall
That's the time of the year that Christmas is here
With peace and goodwill for all
How I love that Christmas feelin'
How I treasure it's friendly glow
See the way a stranger greets you
Just as though you'd met him Christmas's ago
Christmas helps you to remember
To do what other folks hold dear
What a blessed place the world would be
If we had the Christmas feelin' all year


"My Merry Christmas Song"
Merry Christmas Mary thank you for the child
Thank you for Lord Jesus thank you for the child
Christmas time is here again peace on Earth good will to men
The air is filled with joyful sounds merry wishing all around
Giving and receiving gifts stopping by to thank all of our friends
And we thank you Mary for helping give God's greatest gift to man
Merry Christmas Mary thank you for the child
Thank you for Lord Jesus thank you for the child
Merry Christmas Mary to often we forget
To thank you for your part in giving the greatest Christmas present yet
Merry Christmas Mary


"Merry Christmas Mary"
Joseph was tired
They'd been traveling all day
And it was almost midnight
Before he found a place to stay
He put the burrow in the stall
Then knelt beside his wife
To comfort her
As she went through
The pain of giving life
And up above a star was shining brightly in the sky
Joseph held the baby child
And showed him to his wife
And he said
Merry Christmas, Mary
Let me be the first to say
Merry Christmas, Mary
The son of God has come to us today
There was someone at the door
And Joseph turned to see
Some plain and simple shepherd men
Down on bended knee
They talked about an angel
Who told them where to come
In the middle of the night to see
God's only son
Then later there came wisemen
Bearing gifts and offerings
And Joseph led them all to see
And praise the new born king
And they said
Merry Christmas, Mary
Let us be the first to say
Merry Christmas, Mary
The son of God has come to us today
Tears of joy
Were gently flowing
Out of Joseph's eyes
While up above the angels sang
Glory to God
Merry Christmas, Mary
Let us be the first to say
Merry Christmas, Mary
The son of God has come to us today
The son of God has come to us today

How did how did pop Carter which is June's father
Mama how did he celebrate Christmas when you all were first married
[Maybelle]
When we first married
[June]
Mama he didn't have a great big old copper kettle somewhere hid up in the mountain
[Maybelle]
June can tell you that story John
But I will tell you that he used to go buy a bushel of apples
And a bushel of oranges and fruit like that for the girls
And he'd divided in three three ways and they could do what they wanted to
If they want to give it away okay they couldn't have none of the rest of the others see
Their's had to last them through Christmas and you know
They couldn't go to one of the other girls and say
Hey gimme some of your fruit mine's all gone
[June]
I want to tell you that story about how you asked about the celebratin'
Back years ago they didn't have too much to celebrate with
Up in that country unless you made your own
And my father somewhere had him the dandiest copper kettle with little pipes
Goin' out all over it somewhere up in the hills
[Harold]
My uncle knew him
[June]
And my grandmother Carter was quite a woman
And she never said one word to my daddy
But she was always goin' into Clinch Mountain huntin' wood
And draggin' it down on her back
And she came out of there one day draggin' that great big ol' forked stick
With a copper kettle right on the end of it
And she was my father's name was Ezra Carter and she'd say Ezra
She said oh Ezra said look here Ezra
I found the dandiest copper kettle for makin' apple butter
And he never said a word
[Anita]
And we always had good apple butter


"Christmas Time's A"
Christmas time's a
Christmas time's a
Snowflakes are falling, my old home's a calling
Tall pines are humming, Christmas time's a
Can't you hear them bells ringing, ringing joy, joy hear them singing
When it's snowing I'll be going back to my country home
Christmas time's a
Christmas time's a
Holly's in the window, home's where the wind blows
Can't walk for running, Christmas time's a
Can't you hear them bells ringing, ringing joy, joy hear them singing
When it's snowing I'll be going back to my country home
Christmas time's a

White candles burning, my old heart's a yearning
For the folks at home when Christmas time's a

When it's snowing I'll be going back to my country home

How bout your Christmas Flute
I think maybe eh that I enjoy Christmas now more than I did back then
Because I think seein' my my family wife and two kids get things that they like
I enjoy that more than anything more than the Christmas years ago is the Christmas we have now
And eh course I know I was real fortunate in not ever havin


"Christmas With You"
It's so nice to spend Christmas with you
The times that I've seen Christmas come and go are now two score
I wish you a merry Christmas and I wish you a many more
It's good to see the children laugh with joy the way they do
And it's nice to spend Christmas with you
That old fashioned Christmas is a sweet memory
Except for all the Christmasses that you weren't there with me
But now I really feel the spirit cause I love you like I do
And it's nice to spend Christmas with you
I remember Christmas when I little could afford
And I try to remember it's the birthday of our Lord
Well I'll not forget to thank him for his blessing's on me too
And that I can spend Christmas with you
That old fashioned Christmas
It's so nice to spend Christmas with you


"Narration"
Yes times was hard along about that time
We were lucky if we had a radio battery
But as John says in his song
We were all together which meant more than anything else
Well Mama I'll dedicate this to you and ask Mother Maybelle Carter to play it
This is Christmas as I knew it


"Christmas As I Knew It"
One day near Christmas when I was just a child
Mama called us together and mama tried to smile
She said you know the cotton crop hadn't been too good this year
There's not a lot of spending money and well at least we're all here
I hope you won't expect a lot of Christmas presents
Just be thankful that there is plenty to eat
That'll make things a little more pleasant
And us kids got to thinking how really blessed we were
At least we were all healthy and most of all we had her
Roy cut down a pine oak tree and we drug it home Jack and me
Daddy killed a squirrel and Louise made the bread
Reba decorated the tree with popcorn strings before we went to bed
Mama and daddy sacrificed because this Christmas was kind of lean
After all there was the babies Tom and Joanne
And babies need a few things
I whittled a whistle for my brother Jack
And though we disagreed now and then
When I gave Jack that whistle he knew I thought the world of him
Mama made the girl's dresses out of flower sacks
And when she ironed them down
You couldn't tell that they hadn't come from town
A sharecropper family across the road didn't have it as good as us
They didn't even have a light and it was way past dusk
And mama said
Well I bet they don't even have coal oil
Let alone apples and oranges and such
Me and Jack took a jar of coal oil nd some hickernuts we'd found
We walked to the sharecropper's porch and set 'em down
A poor old ragged lady eased open the door
She picked up the coal oil and hickernuts and said
I sure do thank you
and quickly closed the door
We started back home me and Jack
And about halfway we stopped looked back
And in the sharecropper's window at last was a light
So for one of the neighbors and for us it was a good Christmas night
Christmas came and Christmas went
Christmas that year was heaven sent
And my daddy put on his rubber boots
And paced the floor waiting for the thaw
Back home in Dyess Arkansas

You know Carl Perkins and I lived right across the Mississippi River from each other
I bet you coulda heard my Daddy shootin' that dynamite on Christmas mornin' if you'd been listenin' Carl
John I probably did cause we didn't have a lot of nothin'
I memeber we drug one ole firecracker around and wore it out we's afraid to light it
Things in Lake County wadn't too bright but kinda like Marshall said we kinda filled up on love around that time of the year
That's when the crops was all out and eh I remember my folks my mom and dad kinda pinched the pennies
And that's when we got our new overall britches
I kinda strutted around pretty good on Christmas Day with those on
But Christmas to me is a sad and a warm time of the year
We did a lotta singin' that's about all we had
And that wadn't too good
But there's a lotta sweet memories over in Lake County for me


"When You're Twenty"
It was Christmas Eve the night your poor Maw died son
And I reckon she prayed all of her life that she could raise you to be twenty
Me and you never moved into town boy we just kept on livin' out here
Aw and life's been good and bad Son for the past twenty
Oh I remember now when you were a little fella and I used to take my boy to church
And when you sang the Christmas carols with the other boys oh it gave Daddy's heart a jerk
Why you sounded a lot like a little angel Boy
And to Papa you sure looked sweet
Even though your little ragged britches came half way to your skinny little knees
Oh and it made your Poppa proud boy and it filled my ole heart with joy
The Preacher'd step down and he'd pat your head and he say
My my got yourself a fine little boy
Well maybe my life down here's about over boy
Maybe my days on earth's about done
Maybe now I'll see your Mama and live with the Lord boy
But Merry Christmas to you and a happy birthday Son


"An Old Fashioned Tree"
How I miss that old fashioned Christmas
Carols being sung by the tree
Window's candlelight shining bright for the whole world to see
Children's eyes of sweet expectations
Wondering what each present will hold
Lying in their beds and impatient
On long Christmas eves of old
It used to be that all the family would gather for this one night
It used to be that special feeling shared together knowing Christmas was here one night a
Year
How I miss that old fashioned Christmas
Memories that last through the years
Call me sentimental
I wish an old fashioned Christmas to you
They tell me
Somewhere this life isn't crazy
But I've travelled the world far and wide
And I say they're wrong
Don't sell me
Stories that music's a lady
It's not when the singer's alone
At the end of a song
At the end of a song
There's no one
After the last note is played
Only the memory stays
Then even that fades away
And there's nothing so hard
As convincing your heart
That you should start singing again
You told me
Nothing could change perfect lovers
But like ev'ry promise you made
It broke before long
It's lonely
Falling away from each other
But we've come to the last of your words
And the end of a song
At the end of a song
There's no one
After the last note is played
Only the memory stays
Then even that fades away
And there's nothing so hard
As convincing your heart
That you should start singing again


"Narration"
You know when I was a kid at the end of that Christmas day like Carl says
We were all tired from chasin' somebody else's bicycle
Or runnin' up and down the road or somethin'
But I remember you know one of the biggest blessings
That I can remember from Christmas time was a radio
Like all year you know radio back then you didn't hear Christmas carols on ev'ry
There wadn't ev'ry street corners there wadn't street corners
And there weren't chorial groups runnin' up and down the road
In front of your house singin' Christmas carols
And it's somethin' that we take for granted now, but when I was a kid
It was a real privilege and a treat to hear Christmas carol
And about the end of Christmas day when we were all tired
And we'd had all we could eat
I remember sittin' down and turnin' on the radio
And hearin' the Christmas carols played on the radio stations all around
That we picked up in Northeast Arkansas
And it was a real thrill if we could hear a song like this


"Silent Night"
(Silent night holy night)
Silent night holy night all is calm all is bright
Round young virgin mother and child holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night all is dark save the light
See the eastern wise men bring gifts and homage to our King
Christ the Saviour is born Jesus the Saviour is born
Silent night (holy night) all is calm all is bright
Poorest dreams from heaven afar heavenly host sing hallelujah
(Christ the Savious is born Jesus the Saviour is born)
Silent night holy night wonderous dark lend Thy light
With the angels let us sing hallelujah hail the King
Christ the Saviour is born Jesus the Saviour is born

"Orleans Parish Prison"
Well, have you seen my darkhaired girl
She was set on her love to a hungry world
They got her clothes anA the money she took
And they wrote her name in the prison books
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my darkhaired girl
She's tired and cold and you got the gold
She took from a hungry world
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my darkhaired girl
Well have seen my green eyed son
He shot a man down with a sawed off gun
And they fond him down by the Pontchartrain
Where they cuffed his arms with a big iron chain
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free me green eyed son
I heard him say as you let him away
Sorry for what he's done
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free me green eyed son
Well have you missed my brother man
He took a little money with a gun in his hand
Know the kids are hungry and the wife ain't well
And the daddy's locked up in a prison cell
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my brother man
I know it's sad but he ain't bad
He's doing the best he can
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my brother man


"Jacob Green"
Jacob Green got busted for possession
Next morning early he appeared in court
But he was sent to jail to wait to be trialed at some later date
Next morning early, there came a sad report
At the jail they took away his clothes to shame him
And to make sure Jacob Green had no pride left
They cut of all his hair today they found him hanging there
Afraid to face the day he killed himself
It happened yesterday and if you turn your head away
Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun
Not only Jacob Green, but many more you've never seen
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
Jacob's father hired a team of lawyers
Inspections and long inquiries were held
The sheriff then retired and the papers said two guards were fired
They put a brand new coat of paint on Jacob's cell
But like a tomb that looks so white and shiny
Inside you'll find corruption never seen
And somewhere out there tonight in a dirty cell without a light
There will be locked up another Jacob Green
It happened yesterday and if you turn your head away
Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun
Not only Jacob Green, but many more you've never seen
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done


"Me And Bobby Mcgee"
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin for the trains
Feelin nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
Took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin time and
Bobby clappin hands we finally sang up every song
That driver knew
Freedoms just another word for nothin left to lose
And nothin aint worth nothin but its free
Feelin good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
From the coalmines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin right beside me through everythin I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
The somewhere near salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
She was lookin for the love I hope shell find
Well I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin Bobbys body close to mine
Freedoms just another word for nothin left to lose
And nothin left was all she left to me
Feelin good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee


"Prisoner's Song"
I wish I had someone to love me someone to call me their own
I wish I had someone to live with cause I'm tired of livin' alone
I'll be carried to the new jail tomorrow leavin' my little darling all alone
With the cold prison walls all around me and my head on a pillow of stone
(Make that piano cry Larry Butler)
If I had the wings of an angel over these prison walls I would fly
I would fly to the arms of my darling and there I'd be willing to die


"Invertebraes"
Some men spend a lifetime in the hope they can devise
A chart which will an able man then someday analyze
The wretched men who stumble then somehow cannot arise
They'll pay one man to draw the charts another to declare
What secret signs are in the lines but do they really care
That one is long and one is short and one line is not there
For charts or abstract documents that cannot have a soul
They cannot tell why this man fell and that one reached his goal
Nor can they tell why some rebel and lose all self control
I think a thousand years from now as it was long ago
Two roads will be for all to see but which way will man go
Will he arise toward the skies to reach for some new plateau
Will he devise a brave new world a world thus far unknown
Will he plow under all the seeds of greed and hate he sewn
Or will he steal the very field he plants his hopes upon
As long as there are two such roads a man can look upon
As long as some men linger deep within the twilight zone
The weak will always take the road that leads to wall of stone
There should be made a stone blockade torn from the prison stone
And make a wall across all roads man should not walk upon
And let the seeds of bitter weeds grow till that road is gone
Then those who sot in higher power those who hold the might
Could then direct the hordes of men on to the way that's right
And then the men who draw the charts would also see the light


"That Silver Haired Daddy Of Mine"
In a vine covered
Shack in the mountains
Bravely fighting
The battle of time
There's a dear one
Who's wept
Through life's sorrows
It's that silver
Haired daddy of mine
If I could recall
All the heartaches
Dear ole daddy
I've caused you to bear
If I could erase
Those lines from your face
And bring back
The gold to your hair
If God would but
Grant me the power
Just to turn back
The pages of time
I would give all
I own just to put a tone
To that silver
Haired daddy of mine
If I could recall
All the heartaches
Dear ole daddy
I've caused you to bear
If I could erase
Those lines from your face
And bring back
The gold to your hair
If God would but
Grant me the power
Just to turn back
The pages of time
I would give all
I own just to put a tone
To that silver
Haired daddy of mine

"City Jail"
City jail city jail like an old scared dog I tuck my tail
Bow my head and not a careless word is said
Gotta sleep on the floor once more at city jail
Well I was hangin' round the bus station
Mindin' my own business like I always do
When I saw this waitress in this bus station cafe
And I thought I check out the action like I always do
I'd give her the bad eye and made a few choices personal comments
About what I thought mine and her possibilities could be for a team
When she called the badge on me
The badge grabbed me by the arm and he said
What are you doin' hangin' around here for
And I said for whatever's goin' around
City jail city jail
He said no what I mean is what are you doin'
Sayin' things like that to that lady
And I said what's that lady's doin' with purple hair
Well the badge said you're smart alec and I said no I ain't I'm just hungry
And he said you're actin' like a smart alec
And I said no that's how I act when I get hungry
City jail city jail
Well he put me outside in a dark corner
And before you could say hypocrite he hit me on the head
And I said oooh don't hit me on the head
I can't protect myself with the handcuffs on
Please don't hit me on the head then he hit me again he hit me again he hit me again
And I said oh oh oh oh oh please don't stand on my feet when you hit me
I break my ankles when I fall
City jail city jail
Well about that time they threw me in the wagon
And that waitress walked out with a sailor
I said hey you not you I'm talkin' to the purple people eater
Yes you lady quote you're the cause of it all unquote
Then she said to that sailor said get me away from that horrible man Harry
City jail city jail
Well as they hauled me away I said everybody have a nice evening

"Life Of A Prisoner"
He drinks a cup of coffee and way before the sun he's up and goin'
Out on a work detail cause he knows soon the morning whistle will begin to blowin'
All day out in that hot sun with no reward for any work he'll do
And then he'll come back in the evening
And dreams a lot of dreams that can't come true
This is the life of a prisoner forgotten man that's there to stay
He lives on faith and hope and courage and a few old dreams of yesterday
Well no one cares about him or it seems at way to him as time goes by
One day is like the other and every time he prays he prays to die
He's been there for so long now he wouldn't know how to talk to men outside
And though it's the life he lives for he fears the day the gates swing open wide
This is the life of a prisoner
He lives on faith and hope and courage and a few old dreams of yesterday


"Looking Back In Anger"
A cold bitter mist covers your eyes torment is raging in you
But you can't change the smallest part of all the wrongs you've done
Looking back in anger like you do
I'm not preachin' I'm just talkin' but I believe in what I say
That look of anger that you keep flashin' won't
accomplish you anything today
Reach out your hand someone will take it
Someone took mine then I saw a different view
I saw it'd take take a lot more loving
And a lot less looking back in anger like you do
You're still a victim of the pornographic past
The smutty face of evil showing through
But you can't take away the scars that you put on that face
Looking back in anger like you do
Now I ain't preachin' I'm just talkin' but I believe in what I say
That look of anger that you keep flashin' won't accomplish you anything today
Reach out your hand someone will take it
Someone took mine then I saw a different view
I saw it'd take take a lot more loving
And a lot less looking back in anger like you do


"Nobody Cared"
It all started out in Illinois with a woman that I thought was just my own
She saw a new tie and a new shirt kicked her heels and flipped her skirt
Slammed that door and left me standing all alone
They had a love nest in his new club there went my wife all over town
As I watched it I got green and with my drinkin' I got mean
Stuck a match and burned that club right to the ground
And I spent nine months in the hole lyin' there in solitaire
And nobody cared nobody cared nobody cared
There was a screw out in the hall that had me backed up to the wall
Escortin' me with a water pistol in that 36 degrees
With me shiverin' to my knees I ain't gonna forget about that water pistol
If I've been bad you think that'll make me better
If I've been a sinner you think that'll make me a saint no it ain't
Freedom come and I found him made him take off
All his clothes and socks and shoes
Had him scramblin' on the floor tryin' to make it to the door
Cryin' crawlin' screamin' bloody murder too
Well I didn't really kill him though over his whole world there hung a paw
I made him bend over on his knees and to his screams of Owen please
Took my turpentine water pistol and I let him have it all
Cause I spent nine months
And nobody cared nobody cared nobody cared


"Help Me Make It Through The Night"
Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
till the early morning light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care what's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord, tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
I don't care what's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord, tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
Lord, it's bad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

"I Saw A Man"
Last night I dreamed an angel came
He took my hand, he called my name
He bid me look the other way
I saw a man, I heard him say
He said if I be lifted up
I'll draw all men to me
He turned and then I saw
the nail
that bled for me
I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there
My life my heart I gave
my soul was in his care
When I awoke my heart beat so and in the dark I saw a glow
This was no dream he turned my way
Again I heard my Saviour say
He said if I be lifted up
I'll draw all men to me
He turned and then I saw
the nail
that bled for me
I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there

"Any Old Wind That Blows"
Lord, she's restless
Like cotton candy clouds that sail the day
Slow an' free
And she possesses
A mind that can't resign itself to stay
For long with me
Tho' I've tried and tried to keep her tied and satisfied
Until she really needs me
Yes I do
But when that certain look comes on her face
I can't replace it, and she leaves me
She's a butterfly in mid July
Who just can't wait to try her brand new wings
On brand new things
And she needs no rhyme or reason, when she goes
Her mind is on what lies beyond that wall of blue horizon
I suppose
And heaven knows
She'll go sailin' off on any old wind that blows
Yes she will, yes she will
She'll go sailin' off on any old wind that blows
I know she needs me
About as much as I need someone else
Which I don't
And if need be
I swear someday I'll up and leave myself
Which I won't
Even if she loved another man, I'd understand it more than I do
Mmm, mmm, mmm
But I know the only reason
That she ever had for leavin', is she wants to


"Kentucky Straight"
Up in kentucky they make a whiskey
They call a kentucky straight whiskey
And up in kentucky I married a woman
That I bet she is a better woman
Than that whiskey is whiskey
I call her my kentucky straight
I've rambled round the country side
I've drifted near and far
I've been off to seek my fortune
I've been followin' every star
I've rode the devil's highway
The hell bound interstate
But now I'm back at happy shack
With my kentucky straight
And we rise up every morning with the chicken
And every minute we're alive we're livin'
She's a little bit old fashioned but her lovin's up to date
And I'm happy here with my kentucky straight
I had looked for satisfaction in the arms of quite a few
And I've done everything that I was big enough to do
But everywhere I see her face from maine to golden gate
And I knew that this is where it's at with my kentucky straight
And we rise up every morning with the chicken
And every minute we're alive we're livin'
I love her so she knows that it was worth a while to wait
Cause I'm happy here with my kentucky straight


"The Loving Gift"
You gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
You gave me a song I learned to sing
You showed me some beauty through the windows of your soul
And you showed me a world I've never seen
Each giving to the other love and givin' it away
We spent the precious time we knew was borrowed
Cause you gave me the courage to live with yesterday
And you gave me tomorrow
You brought me a candle to light my way to bed
You erased those shadows I'd been seeing
You brought me a pillow to rest my weary head
You taught me a gentle way of dreaming
And even if you leave me I'll be richer when you go
I'm richer with the loving gift you gave me
Cause you gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
And you gave me a baby


"The Good Earth"
The good earth swallows up the seed and swallows life as well
From long before the day you're born till heaven comes or hell
It binds your hands with chains of clay that are so hard to break
But when I left good earth behind I made a big mistake
I've traveled far and traveled wide
I've seen a lot of things
But looking back on all the years
I don't know what they mean
Like steel I'm probably stronger
From going through the fire
I kept on climbin' lower
Diggin' deeper to get higher
I turned around one evening when the sun was going down
I heard the Bible told a preacher who just pulled into town
At last I'm back on good earth where I should have always been
Lord forgive me if I ever try to leave good earth again
Well the good earth was my mama and my daddy too
Now I'm working my hands in soil tryin' to pay my due
And when I'll breathe my last breath which may not be too long
Just shovel a little good earth over my head
Til everybody open up the hymn book and sing a happy song
Shall we gather at the river in the sweet by and by
Just as I am Jesus loves me one of these days I'll fly
I'm standing on the promises Lord build the place for me
In the good earth over Jordan by the Sea of Galilee mhm


"Best Friend"
Hmm an old man on his deathbed once said to me
You are the master of your destiny
A diamond is a diamond and a stone is a stone
But a man's not all good nor all bad
When the chips're all down and your back's at the wall
You're the best friend that you've ever had
You're the best friend that you've ever had
So you laugh when it's time to laugh and you cry when it's time to cry
Live while it's time to live cause you'll die when it's time to die hmm
Then he closed his eyes and he left me alone
This old man's wisdom brought his meaning home
A diamond is a diamond
Well now that I'm older I found this is true
The thing that remains is the good that you do
A diamond is a diamond and a stone is a stone
But a man's not all good nor all bad
When the chips are all down and your back's at the wall
God is the best friend that you've ever had
God is the best friend that you've ever had
So you laugh when it's time


"Oney"
I dedicate this song to the workin' man
For ever' man that puts in
Eight or ten hard hours a day of work and toil and sweat
Always got somebody lookin' down his neck
Tryin' to get more out of 'im
Than he really ought to have to put in
After twenty
In this shop with Oney standin' over me
Today when that old whistle blows
I'll check in all my gear and I'll retire
The superintendent just dropped by and said
They'd planned my little get together
Then he said I'd never a made it
If old Oney hadn't held me to the fire
I've seen him in my dreams at night
And woke up in the mornin' feelin' tired
And old Oney don't remember, when I came here
How he tried to get me fired
With his folded hands behind him
Every mornin' Oney waited at the gate
Where he'd rant and rave like I committed murder
Clockin' in five minutes late
But today they'll gather 'round me
Like I've seen 'em do when any man retires
Then old Oney's gonna tell me
From now on I'm free to do what I desire
He'll present me with that little old gold watch
They give a man at times like this
But there's one thing he's not countin' on
Today's the day I give old Oney his
I've been workin', buildin' muscles
Oney's just been standin' 'round a gettin' soft
And today about four
I'll make up for every good night's sleep I've lost
When I'm gone I'll be remembered
As the workin' man who put his point across
With a right hand full of knuckles
Cause today I show old Oney who's the boss
Hmmmm
Hey, Oney
Oney


"The Ballad Of Annie Palmer"
On the island of Jamaica
Quit a long long time ago
At rose hall plantation
Where the ocean breezes blow
Lived a girl named Annie Palmer
The mistress of the place
And the slaves all lived in fear
To see a frown on Annie's face
Wheres your husband Annie
Where's number two and three
Are they sleeping beneath the palms
Beside the Caribbean sea
At night I hear you riding
And I hear your lovers call
And I still can feel your presence
Around the great house at rose hall
Well if you should ever go to see the great house at rose hall
There's expensive chairs and china
And great paintings on the wall
They'll show you any sitting room
And the whipping post outside
But they won't let you see the room
Where Annie's husbands died
Wheres your husband Annie
Where's number two and three
Are they sleeping beneath the palms
Beside the Caribbean Sea
At night I hear you riding
And I hear your lovers call
And I still can feel your presence
Around the great house at rose hall


"Too Little Too Late"
So you're feeling numb about me being gone
So you see now you're half alive when you're alone
Well I just hope the pain will ease a little as you wait
You gave me love but too little too late
Dark days're coming now you see
Hard times for you as well as me
All time load is coming under your front gate
You gave me love but too little too late
So you got plans about some fine affair
Well think about it a little while while you're lying there
Love long and hard and don't make your lover wait
You gave me love but too little too late
Dark days're coming now you see
Hard times for you as well as me
All time load is coming under your front gate
You gave me love but too little too late
You gave me love but too little too late


"If I Had A Hammer"
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
If I had a hammer
I'd hammer in the morning
I'd hammer in the evening
All over this land
I'd hammer out danger
I'd hammer out a warning
I'd hammer out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land
If I had a bell
I'd ring it in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening
All over this land
I'd ring out danger
I'd ring out a warning
I'd ring out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land
If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning
I'd sing it in the evening
All over this land
I'd sing out danger
I'd sing out a warning
I'd sing out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land
Well I've got a hammer
And I've got a bell
And I've got a song to sing
All over this land
It's the hammer of justice
It's the bell of freedom
It's the song about love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land


"Country Trash"
I got a crib full of corn and a turnin' plow
But the ground's too wet for the hopper now
Got a cultivator and a doubletree
[1]
A leather line for the haw and gee
[2]
Let the thunder roll and the lightin' flash
I'm doin' alright for country trash
I'm saving up dimes for a rainy day
I got about a dollar laid away
The wind's from the south and the fishing's good
Got a potbelly stove a cord
Mama turns the left
I'm doin' alright for country trash
I got a mackinaw
[3]
and a huntin' dog
A cap I ordered from the catalog
A big tall tree that shades the yard
A big fat sow for the winter's lard
Let the thunder roll and the lightin' flash
I'm doin' alright for country trash
Well there's not much new ground left to plow
And crops need fertilizin' now
My hands don't earn me too much gold
For security when I grow old
But we'll all be equal under the grass
And God's got a heaven for country trash
And God's got a heaven for country trash
I'll be doin' alright for country trash
[A doubletree is a crossbar on a wagon or carriage to which two whiffletrees are attached for harnessing two animals abreast.]

"Welcome Back Jesus"
Lord if you should be looking down at little me
I just like to say I'm trying to stay upon the right track
But Lord the way gets hard temptation's come and I sure get tired

Welcome back Jesus welcome back Jesus


"The Color Of Love"
Well I used think the color of love would be a
Rosy red or a pretty pink And I thought it would
Be a thirsty man crawlin' home to get a big old
Drink And I thought love was spelled like a bell
double L bell that you ring Stead of wham bam
Hit your man with a pan Hit him on the head hear
The birdies sing
Oh you heart breakin' love makin' cut
Me
Shiftin' flour siftin' nose liftin' rose of woman
Kind Just keep on doin' what you're doin' what
You're doin' suits me just fine And love I tell
You somethin' else you blow my mind
Well I used to think the color of love would be a
Soft green like a pea in a pod And I thought love
Would strike like a light flashin' down a big old
Lightnin' rod And I thought love was spelled
double L well that would never run dry Stead
Of choke choke I'm so broke and dry I can't afford
A little bitty tear to cry
Oh you money turnin' egg churnin' butter burnin'
Baby of mine You half crazy lean and lazy pretty
As a wilted daisy man of mine Just keep on
Doin'... You blow my mind you blow my mind you
Blow my mind you blow my mind


"Saturday Night In Hickman"
When the sun goes down in Nashville go out that Memphis highway
Between Centerville and Dickson on the gravel roads and byways
They'll be runnin' off the shine that will be bringin' in the bounty
Saturday night in Hickman County
At the beer joint on the black top country music's playin' steady
And the workin' men are drinkin' and they're rough and they are ready
And the girl behind the counter who has all the boys a buzzin'
Will be leavin' with her husband Saturday night in Hickman County
Down upon the Piney River parked beside the pretty water
In the backseat of a Chevy is your next door neighbor's daughter
They have split up into pairs the four that went off datin' double
Gettin' that po' girl into trouble Saturday night in Hickman County
All the farmers in the valley will be sittin' by the fire
Watch the late news on the TV then they'll quietly retire
Thankful just to be a livin' thankful that tomorrow's Sunday
Sorry that the next day's Monday Saturday night in Hickman County
Saturday night in Hickman County


"Allegheny"
How she got that junk car runnin' guess I'll never know
It never ran but once and set to winters in the snow
Well imagine runnin' out on me when I lay sound asleep Allegheny
Well my big mistake was thinkin' she was something I could keep
She stole my winter's food supply and something else I fear
My savin's in the mattress have strangely disappeared
Now those who know me best knows he who robs me best beware Allegheny
I'm gonna call up the dogs and hunt you down drag you back here by the hair
Oh Allegheny something tells me you're dis
Well could it be because I've been your mail
There's a half of you that's French yeah and I need to crave a better style
And a half of you is Cherokee yeah and I've gone wild Allegheny
She's got a head start on me as a crow flies half a day
And unless I miss my guess she'll stop to rest in Monterey
But if I take the Knoxville Highway thirteen hours it will be Allegheny
Well she forgot I knew the shortcut I'll be there in less than three
Oh Allegheny something tells me
I signaled for my dogs to wait outside the hotel door
I described her to the desk clerk he said try the second floor
And then he mentioned she's got company
And that marks the stranget's doom Allegheny
I wish I was her so I could see my face when I bust into the room
Oh Allegheny something tells me
Allegheny Allegheny come back here Allegheny Allegheny


"Life Has Its Little Ups And Downs"
I don't know how to tell her I didn't get that raise in pay today
(That's all right John)
Cause I know how much she wanted that dress in Baker's window
And it breaks my heart to tell her she'll have to wait
And cancel all the plans we made to celebrate
But I just know that she can take it with a smile and not a frown
Cause she knows life has its little ups and downs like ponies on a merry
And no one grabs a brass ring every time but she don't mind (I don't mind)
She wears a gold ring on her finger and it's mine
Those new house plans we've had so long I guess will gather dust another year
And the daffodils are bloomin' that she planted way last fall upon the hill
And over by the gate God knows I hate to say again we'll have to wait
But I just know that she can take it with a smile and not a frown
Cause she knows life has its little ups and downs like ponies on a merry
And no one grabs a brass ring every time but she don't mind (No I don't mind)
She wears a gold ring on her finger and it's mine
She wears a gold ring on her finger and it's mine


"Matthew 24 (Is Knocking At The Door)"
I heard on the radio there's rumors of war
People getting ready for battle
And there may be just one more
I heard about an earthquake
And the toll it took away
These are the signs of the times we're in today
Matthew twenty
And there can't be too much more to come to pass
Matthew twenty
And a day or one more could be the last
A great bear from the northland has risen from his sleep
And the Army ranks in red are near two hundred million deep
The young and old now prophesy a coming
Prince of Peace
And last night I dreamed of lightning in the east
Matthew twenty
And there can't be too much more to come to pass
Matthew twenty
And a day or one more could be the last


"City Of New Orleans"
Ridin' on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday mornin' rail
15 cars and 15 restless riders
Three conductors, 25 sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey the train pulls out of Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' graves that have no name, freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of rusted automobiles
Good mornin' America, how are you
Don't you know me
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done
Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels grumblin' neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep, rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel
Good mornin' America, how are you
Don't you know me
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done
Night time on the City of New Orleans
Changin' cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Halfway home, we'll be there by mornin'
Thru the Mississippi darkness rollin' down to the sea
But all the towns
people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his song again
The passengers will please refrain
This train has got the disappearin railroad blues
[Repeat Chorus]


"Tony"
This is the story of Tweedle
And a cowboy that I knew named Tony
From Blithe Fresno ol' Sant Joe Washoe go rodeo
Pendleton Santa Ana Baker Bozeman and Burley
From Chambers to Payson Rapid City to Akron
We'd sing just to ease all the hurts that we gained
A bandage to wrap the aches and a few turns of tape
Held us together and stopped the blood stains
Well sometimes we'd draw bad and the stock wouldn't buck
And there was times when the luck wasn't goin' our way
But a credit card that I'd found would get us to the next town
With just a switch of his Montana plates
I remember at Evanston when a bull broke his arm
And we had to make it on into Beulah the next day
I broke out the CB and the only doctor Tony seen
Was me and a can of ether
There in the Beulah shoot gates
And it was at Louisville that I went down in the well
And a suicide wrap I held in my hand
The clown just shook his boom while I dangled near doom
It was Tony that saved my life then
Then a year from that week we pulled up at Mesquite
Where I drew number twelve from the herd
And Tony my side kick pulled Tweedle
That bull's famous from Prairie to Evansburg
All right now cowboys kinda clear the way
Let that ambulance through there let that ambulance on through
Looks like a pretty bad wreck out there folks
Hold up folks we go one more ride left down there in the shoots
Wait a minute it looks like they're turnin' ole number twelve out
So that's all for today folks
I'll finish the story of Tweedle
And the cowboy that I knew named Tony
From Sterling to Abilene Loveland to New Orleans
I've got a new partner travelin' with me
But I never could explain why I called him the wrong name
When I get drunk I call him Tony
And sometimes he'll ask me why I pass Montana by
You know at Butte they got money
But that's where I met him my side kickin' friend
I've got more than enough of his memories
For down in Mesquite there's a cowboy sleeping
Where bulls ain't a buckin' ain't a buckin' ole Tony


"The Pine Tree"
I lean my back against you thinkin' you were an oak
I knew the wind could bent you but I can't believe you broke
Now the wind could never break me only your false love
Honey I've been true I swear by God above
I thought you were a willow but you never wept for me
You went roamin' in the wildwood like a ship that roams the see
The willow tree is fickle and it weeps in the morning dew
My love is a pine tree cause that's the only tree that's true
If I was mistaken then take my eyes away
You made a bed in the wildwood and that's where I saw you lay
Honey your eyes deceived you it's true I touched the ground
But I never slept there I never let my long hair down mhm
Love is like a thorn bush touch it and you will find
You'll prick your fingers and leave the sweetest flower behind
Love oh love oh what you done to me
You set me a driftin' like a ship upon the sea
Yes a ship there is I see you and you belong to me
My love is the ocean and deeper love cannot be
Yeah well I guess I was mistaken and woman I want you back
You never have left my heart now honey baby that's a fact
Come to me pine tree and we will never part
We'll put our roots down in each other's heart
Come to me pine tree


"We're For Love"
I'm for you I'm for you I'm for anything that starts with us
You're for me you're for me that makes both of us for love
And if we're for each other we won't be bothered
By how much the world may push and shove
It makes no difference who stands against us
As long as you and I are both for love
I'm woman all over when you're around me honey I can't seem to get enough
Let's stay together like this forever and show the world that we're for love
And if we're for each other
As you and I are both for love


"Godshine"
Well a light from the sun comes shinin'
Oh happy day oh happy day
And then along come a big old moon to light my way
And then the stars kinda twinkle and they light this path of mine
And mine
I can't see a thing in his world without a little Godshine
Well Jesus is the beam on the left of me
Comin' right through the shadow on the right
Lord all the dark corners within my soul need you fire day and night
Well the sun and the moon and the stars wouldn't even hold a candle in my life
I'm in the dark when the sun is high
I need just a little bit of Godshine
Well Jesus died and there's a lot of folks feel regret
But on the other hand there are people that are laughin' yet
Laughin' about a man that lived and died divine
He could have lived on but he wouldn't stop spreadin' that Godshine
Well Jesus is the beam on the left of me
Comin' right through the shadow on the right
Lord all the dark corners within my soul need you fire day and night
Well the sun and the moon and the stars wouldn't even hold a candle in my life
I'm in the dark when the sun is high
I need just a little bit of Godshine
Well Jesus is the beam on the left of me
Comin' right through the shadow on the right
Lord all the dark corners within my soul need you fire day and night
Well the sun and the moon and the stars wouldn't even hold a candle in my life
I'm in the dark when the sun is high
I need just a little bit of Godshine
I'm in the dark when the sun is high I need just a little bit of Godshine


"Ragged Old Flag"
I walked through a county courthouse square
On a park bench, an old man was sittin' there
I said
Your old court house is kinda run down
He said
Naw, it'll do for our little town
I said
Your old flag pole is leaned a little bit
And that's a ragged old flag you got hangin' on it
He said
Have a seat
and I sat down
Is this the first time you've been to our little town
I said
I think it is
He said
I don't like to brag, but we're kinda proud of
That Ragged Old Flag
You see, we got a little hole in that flag there
When Washington took it across the Delaware
and It got powder burned the night Francis Scott Key sat watching it
writing
Say Can You See
It got a rip in New Orleans, with Packingham
Jackson
tugging at its seams
and It almost fell at the Alamo
beside the Texas flag
But she waved on though
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill
There was Robert E. Lee and Beauregard and Bragg
And the south wind blew hard on
That Ragged Old Flag
On Flanders Field in World War I
She got a big hole from a Bertha Gun
She turned blood red in World War II
She hung limp, and low, a time or two
She was in Korea, Vietnam, She went where she was sent
by her Uncle Sam
She waved from our ships upon the briny foam
and now they've about quit wavin' back here at home
in her own good land here She's been abused
She's been burned, dishonored, denied an' refused
And the government for which she stands
Has been scandalized throughout out the land
And she's getting thread bare, and she's wearin' thin
But she's in good shape, for the shape she's in
Cause she's been through the fire before
and i believe she can take a whole lot more
So we raise her up every morning
And we bring her down slow every night
We don't let her touch the ground
And we fold her up right
On second thought
do
Cause I'm mighty proud of
That Ragged Old Flag


"Don't Go Near The Water"
Your mama used to worry about that big muddy river
Honey do your remember
You let the screen door slam when you stepped off the front porch
Then your mama calling don't be late
And I'd hear your daddy holler
Son she's my only daughter
You'd stick your nose in the honeysuckle down by the gate
I could still hear your mama calling
don't go near the water
We fell right in
Went over our head
But we didn't go near the water
Nothing beats the young and sweet
And the nights got hotter and hotter
We were sure enough getting our feet wet mama
But we didn't go near the water
We'd hear the rocking chair squeaking
As you sneaked up the back stairs
Mama waiting like a grizzly bear
Had to get the honeysuckle out of your hair
But in the morning light
You'd look her right in the eye
It wasn't a lie
We didn't go near the water
We fell right in
Went over our head
But we didn't go near the water
Nothing beats the young and sweet
And the nights got hotter and hotter
We were sure enough getting our feet wet mama
But we didn't go near the water
Your mama used to worry about that big muddy river
She should've worried about me
Cause we were sure enough getting our feet wet mama
But we didn't go near the water
Didn't go near the water
Didn't go near the water yeah
Boom Chicka Boom


"All I Do Is Drive"
Well, I asked an old truck driver
About life out on the road
If he does a lotta singing
When he's bringing in his load
If there's a pretty waitress crying for him
Every hundred miles
If he gets a lotta loving
If he has a lot of smiles
And I asked him if those trucking songs
Tell about a life like his
He said, if you want to know the truth about it
Here's the way it is
All I do is drive, drive, drive
Try to stay alive
And keep my mind on my load
Keep my eye upon the road
I got nothin' in common with any man
Who's home every day at five
All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive
Well, we shared a cup of coffee
Then I had to warm it up
And his greasy fingers trembled
As he held onto the cup
And I said, don't you hear a lot of music
See a lot of sights
But if you'll tune into the Grand Ole Opry
Saturday night
I will dedicate you a trucking song
To which you can relate
He said, you just do the singing
And I'll do the driving mate
All I do is drive, drive, drive
Try to stay alive
And keep my mind on my load
Keep my eye upon the road
I got nothin' in common with any man
Who's home every day at five
All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive
If I can get the fuel

"Southern Comfort"
I've been a thrill seeking rambler
And often came into this town
But the thrills were too high for my little sky
So I dug in and I've settled down
And I got a good job in Nashville
No way they can pay me enough
For grindin' up tobacco leaves
Making brut and snuff
Southern comfort is killin' me
I'm slowly chokin' in Tennessee
I shovel the snuff until late afternoon
Then I crawl with the traffic and I choke on its fumes
And fall on the face when I get to my room
Southern comfort is killin' me
I met a woman in Nashville
For a while we were carryin' on
She'd washed snuff out of my shirts every night
And keep me with clean ones on
But I guess she got tired of tobacco
At least of the regular kind
Now I'm still workin' where nicotine
And memories are burnin' in my mind
And Southern comfort is killin' me
The Cumberland cannot enhermit each bee
I'm sniffin' and dippin' and livin' alone
I smell funny smoke and I know where she's gone
She's in some other county now proving her own
Southern comfort is killin' me
Southern comfort is killin' me


"King Of The Hill"
If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill
If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill
Get put on at the Harlan mine
Be the last one out at quittin' time
You already workin' when the whistle blew
Never complain about a job to do
When they say who can, you say I will
If you ever gonna be king of the hill
If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill
You need a good woman to share your bed
To keep you loved and to keep you fed
To help you to face another day
To get you up and on your way
Where the golden rule don't rule out true
You do to them before they do to you
Watch out for yourself or nobody will
If you ever gonna be king of the hill
If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill
Saturday night you go to Harlan town
You shoot some pool and you fool around
You watch the girls and you drink bootleg
Get starved to death before you beg
You trust in luck till your luck is gone
Then jump right in and you hang right on
There may be times you would have to kill
If you ever gonna be king of the hill
If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill
When the last of the coals out of every vein
Had long been gone on the northbound train
Walk up to the top and if you're standing still
You can call yourself king of the hill
But if you fall like a lot have done
By accident or knife or gun
When they lay you high on the mountain still
You can call yourself king of the hill
If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill


"Pie In The Sky"
From the day of your birth
It's bread and water here on earth
To a child of light, to a child of light
But there'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright
There'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright
Sometimes I doubt in fear
That I've really gained salvation here
For it's out of sight, for it's out of sight
But there'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright
He said if I do His will
There's a promise He'd fulfill
And He's gone now to prepare
Me a mansion out there
And there'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright
There'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright
There'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright
There'll be pie in the sky


"Lonesome To The Bone"
On the park bench I slept on
Raindrops are fallin' on the newspapers coverin' me
I hear early mornin' motors
And I know the world is wakin' for the dawn
But my mind's down a dark alley
Somewhere where last night you loved me
And in the early mornin' chill my arms remember still
But I'm droppin' like a stone lonesome to the bone
The sun is roughly risin' on the roofs of Stagger town
The time for sweat and poison out is just now comin' 'round
The high time of last midnight is over with and gone
Leavin' me to be lonesome to the bone
I walked away the wind blows
And any way the wind goes will be good enough for me
The streets are loud and crowded
But I walk my weary way lost and alone
Your hot breath and your laughter
Keep flashin' through my mind to warm me
But the naked light of day soon makes it fade away
And I'm droppin' like a stone lonesome to the bone
The sun is roughly risin' on the roofs of Stagger town
The time for sweat and poison out is just now comin' 'round
The high time of last midnight is over with and gone
Leavin' me to be lonesome to the bone

"While I've Got It On My Mind"
Layin' 'round home with a ball game on
Feelin' fairly fine
Blackberry jam is cookin' in the pan
And the jam and the cook are mine
I like my honey from the hives of home
And berries from my old vine
And I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind
My dog is asleep at my bare feet
It's a good day for layin' around
Just her and me and it's Saturday
Everybody's gone to town
We've been workin' hard and she gets tired
That puts me in a bind
Coz I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind
Then she looks at me and I can see
That old familiar look
And the jam is sweet as she lowers the heat
To give it time to cook
Then I lock the door and across the floor
To my queen of woman kind
Yeah, I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind
Now boys don't you be ramble and free
And leavin' the girls to cry
Coz the nights get cold and there ain't no gold
That'll ever satisfy
And there ain't no joy that'll come to you boys
Like the kind I've known at times
When I go right on in that lover
While I got in on my mind
Yeah, I like to get my lovin'
While I got in on my mind


"Good Morning, Friend"
He's not on some golden throne way off and out of space
He's not hidin' out in some big secret hidin' place
I can guarantee he'll be your friend to touch and hold
And I'm qualified to tell it cause I've got it in control
Good morning friend good morning friend
Every day's a brand new morning since the morning you will din
Good morning friend good morning friend
Yes I'm feeling like a million since I've got you livin' in
He'll stand and knock upon your door do you let him inside
He'll be a constant comforter and keep you satisfied
He will make himself avaliable no matter who you are
He'll light your darkest night and be your bright and morning star
Good morning friend good morning friend
Yes I'm feeling like a million since the morning you moved in
Good morning friend good morning friend
Ask me how I feel this morning and I'm proud to say again
Good morning friend good morning friend
Yes I'm feeling like a million since I've got you livin' in


"I'm A Worried Man"
(Worried man,) (Papa is a worried man.)
(Worried man,) (Papa is a worried man.)
The place I go to draw my pay
Closed the door on me today
Told me just to stay away
And don't come back again
Ahh: I told my Mama
Baby, don't you cry
I'll get a job before the day go by
I don't know where, and that is why
I'm a worried man. (Worried.)
Worried man, a worried man
(Worried.) (Worried.)
I'm a very worried man
Hungry babies don't understand
And their Papa is a worried man
Papa is a worried man. (Play it, Johnny,) (Yeah.)
There is no way that I can see
That I can feed my family, (That's sad.)
I don't own a money tree
An' I don't own no land
Now listen: I've got muscle and I've got brains
I don't mind the sun an' the rain
I gotta make a little change
As I'm a worried, worried, worried man, ooh. (Worried.)
Worried man, a worried man
(Worried.) (Worried.)
I'm a very worried man. (Worried man.)
Hungry babies don't understand
And their Papa is a worried man
Their Papa is a worried man. (Take it: take it.)
(That's it, (That's it, that's it, that's it.)
(Ok, do it: go Willie.)
(Worried man, worried man.)
(Papa is a worried man.)

"Please Don't Let Me Out"
I've been in jail eleven years and parole has just come through
The gates will soon swing open wide but I'm not going through
Jail's the only home I know or care to know about
Please let me stay where I belong please don't let me out
How could I tell those friends of mine they've seen the last of me
Can't I make you understand I never can be free
Cause that's a big unfriendly world and I don't know the route
That leads to where I may belong please don't let me out
I had to learn to get along without a lot of things
And I had to learn to live with the loneliness confinement brings
And I learnt to take no mail from home or whatever came about
Now I'm dug in and I'm happy here please don't let me out
How could I tell those friends of mine
Yes that's a big unfriendly world


"What On Earth (Will You Do For Heaven's Sake)"
Did you walk another mile, turn a frown with a smile
Did you lift the lowly heart about to break
Would you also give your cloak to one who took away your coat
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake
Did you feed the poor in spirit and befriend the prosecuted
Will you show the bounds that all the chains can break
Did you sow the proper seed
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake
Will you be one of the meek, did you turn the other cheek
Would you give a little more than you would take
Did you shine your little light upon the children of the night
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake
Did you feed the poor in spirit and befriend the prosecuted
Will you show the bounds that all the chains can break
Did you sow the proper seed
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake


"My Old Kentucky Home (Turpentine And Dandelion Wine)"
Turpentine and dandelion wine
I've turned the corner, an' I'm doin' fine
Shootin' at the birds on the telephone line
Pickin' 'em off with this gun o' mine
Got a fire in my belly and a fire in my head
Going higher and higher 'til I'm dead
Sister Sue is short and stout
She didn't grow up, she grew out
Momma says she's plain, but she's just being kind
Papa thinks she's pretty, but he's almost blind
Don't let her out much except at night
But I don't care 'cause I'm all right
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Young folks roll on the floor
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Keep them hard times away from my door
Brother Gene is big and mean
And he don't have much to say
He had a little woman who he whooped each day
But now she's gone away
Got drunk last night, kicked momma down the stairs
But I'm all right, so I don't care
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
And the young folks are rollin' on the floor
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Keep them hard times away from my door
Turpentine and dandelion wine
I've turned the corner, an' I'm doin' fine
Shootin' at the birds on the telephone line
Pickin' 'em off with this gun o' mine

Goin' higher and higher 'till I'm dead

Keep them hard times away from my door
Keep them hard times away from my door


"Hard Times Comin'"
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times, come again no more
Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times, come again no more
Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more
There's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
With a worn heart, whose better days are o'er
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day
Oh, hard times, come again no more
Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more
Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more


"The Lady Came From Baltimore"
The lady came from Baltimore and all she wore was lace
She didn't know that I was poor, she never saw my place
I was there to steal her money, to take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none
The lady's name was Susan Moore, her daddy read the law
She didn't know that I was poor, and lived outside the law
Her daddy said I was a thief and didn't marry her for love
But I was Susan's true belief, and I married her for love
I was there to steal her money, to take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none
The house she lived in had a wall to keep the robbers out
She never stopped to think at all, that that's what I'm about
I was there to steal her money, to take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none
Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none

"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"
Virgil Caine is the name, and I served on the Danville Train
Til stonemans cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of 65, we were hungry, just barely alive
By may the tenth, richmond had fell, its a time I remember, oh so well
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the people were singin. they went
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Back with my wife in Tennessee, when one day she called to me
Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E. Lee
Now I dont mind choppin wood, and I dont care if the moneys no good
Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the people were singin. they went
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Like my father before me, I will work the land
Like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave, but a yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet
You cant raise a caine back up when hes in defeat


"Clean Your Own Tables"
Well now she ain't exactly what you'd call your all American girl
And some too many truckers took her home
And I'll admid her life would read just like a paperback
And some of what she's done I've said it's wrong
But I said clean your own tables boys and bring out your beer
Cause she ain't gonna do it this time
And drink to a use to be barmaid cause she's a lady I choose to be mine
And I ain't exactly been what you call your all American boy
I've done my time in Frisco in LA
How some of youth are taking pride in what I am
I heard you cussing this decision that I've made
But I said clean your own tables
And I'll admid her life would read just like a paperback
And some of what she's done well I say is wrong
But I said clean your own tables
Boys if you're able clean your own tables and let me take care of mine


"Jesus Was Our Saviour And Cotton Was Our King"
Wagon wheels are turning with cobble colored sound
When me and little Tommy rode the first load in the town
The cotton gin was ginning out the pennies for the pounds
Like a giant vacuum cleaner sucking let up off the ground
Our freckled faces sparkled then like diamonds in the rough
With smiles it smells of snaggleteeth and good old Garett snuff
If I could I would be tradin' all this fat back for the lean
When Jesus was our Saviour and cotton was our king
This kind of life we're living beats all I've ever seen
Seems some of us was born for picking things and eaten beans
Still I reckon girl or diggin' fairly well in our means
Cause Jesus was our Saviour and cotton was our king
Our freckled faces sparkled then like diamonds in the rough
With smiles it smells of snaggleteeth and good old Garett snuff
If I could I would be tradin' all this fat back for the lean
When Jesus was our Saviour and cotton was our king
Our freckled faces sparkled then like diamonds in the rough
With smiles it smells of snaggleteeth and good old Garett snuff
If I could I would be tradin' all this fat back for the lean
When Jesus was our Saviour and cotton was our king


"Reason To Believe"
If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight
Still I look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you makes it hard to live without
Somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give
Never think about myself
If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd try to leave all the past behind
Knowing that you lied straight
Still I look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you makes it easy to live without
Somebody else
Someone like you makes it hard to give
Never think about myself
If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight
Still I look to find a reason to believe
Still I look to find a reason to believe
Still I look to find a reason to believe


"Cocaine Carolina"
Morning found me lyin' on a floor in New Orleans
Looking like the patches was about to eat my jeans
Feeling like my belly was a warehouse for the blues
And I sure miss my sweet Cocaine Carolina
Met her on an oceanliner, called her Cocaine Carolina
She was quite a lady then and I was twenty two
God knows how much I adored her I just never could afford her
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you
So goodbye Cocaine Carolina you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag she knows just what to do
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you
Oh someone said if I was lucky I could go back to Kentucky
Lexington was famous for its bluegrass and its hills
Carolina we should get up, don't you know we'll have to split up
Maybe I should go to California
So goodbye Cocaine Carolina you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag she knows just what to do
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you
Oh goodbye Cocaine Carolina
Oh goodbye Cocaine Carolina


"Smokey Factory Blues"
Early in the misty misty morning headin' for another freeway jam
Sleepy eyed and shriverin' wakin' up and wishin' it was Sunday I wish it was Sunday
On the radio they're playin' love songs songs that make me wanna turn around
Factory gates are up ahead. I wished that I was home in bed
With you, right now, back home with you, right now
But I work to make a living and I work without a break
And I work when I am sleeping and I work when I'm awake
Yes and I'd like to leave the city but I can't afford to move
And I think I'm going under with them way down lowdown smokey factory blues
I was born a lover not a worker
Money doesn't smell like sweet perfume
Some of us feel out of place
Believe me you better believe me
But I work to make a living and I work without a break
And I work when I am sleeping and I work when I'm awake
Yes and I'd like to leave the city but I can't afford to move
And I think I'm going under with them way down, lowdown smokey factory blues
Yes. I work to make a living and I work without a break
And I work when I am sleeping and I work when I'm awake
Yes and I'd like to leave the city but I can't afford to move. (Fade)


"Texas, 1947"
Bein' six years old I had seen some trains before
So it's hard to figure out what I'm at the depot for
Trains're big and black and smokin' steam screamin' at the wheels
Bigger'n anything there is least that's the way she feels
Trains're big and black and smokin' louder'n July 4th
But everybody's actin' like this might be something more
Than just pickin' up the mail or the soldiers from the war
Somethin' even old man Wyman's never seen before
And it's late afternoon on a hot Texas day
Somethin' strange was goin' on and we's all in the way
There are fifty or sixty people just settin' on their cars
And the ole men left their dominoes and come down from the bars
And everybody's checkin' old Jack Kittrell checks his watch
And us kids put our ears to the rails to hear 'em pop
So we already knowed it when they finally said train time
You'd have thought that Judgement Day was rollin' down the line
Cause things got real quiet and mama jerked me back
But not before I get the chance to lay a nickel on the track
Look out here she comes she's comin' look out there she goes she's gone
Screamin' straight through Texas like a mad dog cyclone
Big and red and silver she don't lay no smoke
She's a fast rollin' streamline come to show the folks
I said look out here she comes she's comin' look out there she goes she's gone
Screamin' straight through Texas like a mad dog cyclone
Lord she never even stopped
She left fifty or sixty people still settin' on their cars
Wonderin' what it's comin' to and how it got this far
And me I got a nickel smashed flatter than a dime
By a mad dog runaway red silver streamline train
Look out here she comes she's comin' look out there she goes she's gone
Screamin' straight through Texas like a mad dog cyclone
Big and red and silver she don't lay no smoke
She's a fast rollin' streamline come to show the folks
I said look out here she comes she's comin' look out there she goes she's gone
Screamin' straight through Texas like a mad dog cyclone


"What Have You Got Planned Tonight Diana"
It all started in 1929 me and Diana had gone to Alaska
To homestead some of that free government land
Forty miles from the nearest gravel road we cut our
life in the ponderosa pines
We sweated hard to beat the winter snow
But the cabin's up and we've got lots of times
What have you got planned tonight Diana would you consider
laying in my arms
I love you more than ever now Diana I'm sure you're the reason I was born
Jim was born the first year we were here look at him
Diana he's almost grown
And the baby's in the cradle fast asleep just think
in no time they'll be up and gone
What have you got planned
Well time sure does fly by doesn't it Diana
It's been almost two years now since you've been gone
Think children grew up so fast
But I guess they deserve to see the world now don't they
But you know Diana remembering how you loved me
And how much I love you I don't feel so alone
What have you got planned
What have you got planned


"Look At Them Beans"
This time last year there sure was
A lot of sad faces around this old house
Our papa died without fulfillin' his life's dream
Of producing one of the best crops in Grimes County
Though papa died with that dream still in his head
A desire in his heart, a promise on his lips, calluses on both hands
And two dollars in his pocket
Papa didn't live long enough to see his dreams come true
So he died from too much work, broken spirit, I guess
But I promised our mama that if it was a last thing he'd ever do
He'd live long enough to see just one good crop come through
But you see we can't plan on things without first talking to God
Because we don't know his plans
And if we don't include him my friends the way can get mighty hard
They say that every time a good and righteous person
Is buried in God's good earth it's just fertilizer for the soil
And I guess there must be some truth to that
Whether we believe it or not
I just wish that papa was here right now
So that he could see this good crop that we finally got
Hey look at that beans and look at that corn
And I bet them watermelons must be three feet long
Man look at them tomatoes and look at them peas
Well I know if papa was here right now he'd sure be pleased
And papa would sure be proud of his children too
My brother's famous now got his own show on the road
Traveling in customized bus imported from Europe
That boy always did love music and he loves to travel
I got a sister that's got a good job in a beauty shop
Making money, making other people look good
Ain't nobody here at a house now but me and mama
And mama she's gettin' weaker and she's gettin' older every day
And she talks softly about joinin' papa in his heavenly home
But that woman sure did love that man
She worked beside papa for forty some odd years
Tryin' to produce a good crop and never could grow a single bean
But I just wish that papa was here right now
To see this good crop that we finally got
Man, look at that beans and look at that corn
And I bet them watermelons must be three feet long
Man, look at them tomatoes and look at them peas
Well, I know if papa was here right now he'd sure be pleased
And papa, if you can hear me look at them beans


"No Charge"
Our little boy came up to his mama in the kitchen this evening
While she was fixing supper
And he handed her a piece of paper he'd been writin' on
And after wipin' her hands on her apron she read it and this is what it said
For mowin' the yard 5 dollars
For makin' my own bed this week 1 dollar
For going to the store 50 cents
For playin' with my little brother while you went shoppin' 25 cents
For taking out the trash 1 dollar
For gettin' a good report card 5 dollars
And for rakin' the yard 2 dollars
Total amount owed 14 dollars and 75 cents
Well as mama looked at him standin' there expectanly
And I could see the memories flashin' through her mind
And so she picked up the pen and turnin' the paper over
This is what she wrote and I read it to him
For the nine months she carried you growing inside her no charge
For the nights we sat up with you doctoring you praying for you no charge
For the time and the tears that you've caused through the years there's no charge
When you added all up the full cost of our love is no charge
For the nights filled with dread and the worries ahead no charge
For advice and for knowledge and the cost of your college no charge
For the toys food and clothes and for wiping your nose there's no charge
When you added all up the full cost of our love is no charge
Well when I finished readin' he had big tears in his eyes
And he looked up at his mother and he said mama I sure do love you
Then he took the pen and in great big letter he wrote Paid In Full
When you added all up the cost of real love is no charge


"I Hardly Ever Sing Beer Drinking Songs"
I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
And when they play them cheatin' tunes I never sing along
I never ever sing the blues I've forgotten born to lose
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
I hardly ever walk the floor and cry
And I don't think I've ever said I feel like I could die
I don't ever lay awake I never think my heart will break
I hardly ever walk the floor and cry
I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
I can't put much feeling in saying love is all gone wrong
I don't lose no sleep at night cause things with you are going right
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
I never call your name out in my sleep
You never make me worry and you never make me weep
I never wonder if you're true I spend a night curled up with you
And I never call your name out in my sleep
I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
And when they play them cheatin' tunes I never sing along
I never ever sing the blues I've forgotten born to lose
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs


"Down The Road I Go"
I guess there's not much I can do or say saw my baby with another guy today
Though I love her and I tried to tell her so it's hello blues and down the road I go
I've never seen that guy before today he held my baby in the closest way
And the way she snuggled close to him I know it's hello blues and down the road I go
Well it seems our thoughts were much alike our likes were much the same
We even had our future plan till into town he came
I've never seen that guy
Well it seems our thoughts


"I Never Met A Man Like You Before"
You shined your light so I could see that life was more than a chore
When I came up against the wall you said I am the door
You gave me reason to believe in you now I believe it even more
I've never met a man like you before
You gave me back my pride so I could wear it for all the world to see
You told me if my yesterdays were paid for tomorrow is free
From now until I die I know I won't be lonely anymore
I've never met a man like you before
And if all of my dreams turn to dust before my eyes
And all of my songs remain unsung
If all the world can offer me just emptiness and lies
I know I'll still have your perfect love
Stormy weather comes and goes some of my old friends got washed away
But you're an Island of refuge on your solid rock I found my place
If wordly riches faild me but I have you how can I be poor
I've never met a man like you before


"All Around Cowboy"
Just a broken down cowboy all down on his luck
He's been through the best of his friends
On a long lonesome highway and an old pickup truck
Crossed Texas with a hot dusty wind
He was all around cowboy 1959 from the top it's been a long way down
Since the whiskey and ladies started winning his time
They rode him high and hard to the ground
But he remembers the thrill of bein' a winner
And the feeling of bein' a beginner in the days of his first rodeo
But there was something about winning that didn't last forever
But tomorrow it's bound to get better he'll be the all around cowboy again
The windmills're turning on the west Texas plains but he's dry as an old river bed
He's just like the dust that's a searching for rain but he knows he'll be ridin' again
So he rolls up a smoke and he sips his Old Crow
Whipes the whiskers that cover his chin
He grins as he dreams of the next rodeo to be the all around cowboy again
But he remembers the thrill


"Gone"
I'm on the hill by Friscio Bay
Hawaiian winds blow my past away
There's a freighter there that is southern bound
I'm on my way out of this town
There's Alcatraz and the man that has
Bills love and pills and drink and wine and song
Stand in line and fight and wind and roam
Kids and yard and I'm a man that's tired and gone
There was a time when things were good
We had it better than we ever should
But things got hard and love got old
I got tired and love grew cold
There's Alcatraz and the man that has


"Down At Drippin' Springs"
Campers bikes and mobile homes cars and pickup trucks
Slacks and '59 hairdoes sideburns spears and ducks
There's lone star pearl and fried chicken and one big cloud of smoke
Plug it in and turn it on and the music goes for broke
Down at Drippin' Springs down at Drippin' Springs
There's Willie and Waylon Kris and Tom have you heard Gatlin sing
Down at Drippin' Springs down at Drippin' Springs
Duncan's on and Linda's next time many did Joel Gray down at Drippin' Springs
Well the Texas sun is low and hot upon the chaparral
It would be one ideal spot for God to put his hell
The most beloved cowboys songs echoe cross the plains
T Texas Tyler ain't forgotten next year y'all come again
Down at Drippin' Springs Down at Drippin' Springs
There's Russell Bush and Kris and Coe have you heard Gatlin sing
Down at Drippin' Springs down at Drippin' Springs
There's Willie and Waylon Kris and Tom have you heard Gatlin sing
Down at Drippin' Springs down at Drippin' Springs
Duncan's on and Rita's next how many did Joel Gray down at Drippin' Springs


"Precious Memories"
(Precious mem'ries)
Precious mem'ries unseen angel sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me and the sacred past unfolds
Precious mem'ries how they linger how they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight precious sacred seems unfold
Precious father loving mother fly across the lonely years
And the old home scenes from my childhood in fond memory appear
Precious mem'ries how they linger
Precious mem'ries flood my soul


"Rock Of Ages"
Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee
Let the water and the blood from Thy wounded side which fload
Thee of sin the double cure save from raft and make me pure
Let me hime myself in Thee
In my hand no prize I bring simply to Thy cross I cling
While I draw this pleading breath when my eyes shall close in death
Lord when I rise to world unknown and behold the on Thy throne
Rock of ages cleft for me let me hime myself in Thee
Let me hime myself in Thee


"The Old Rugged Cross"
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
And exchange it some day for a crown
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true
Its shame and reproach gladly bear
Then Hell call me some day to my home far away
Where His glory forever Ill share
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
And exchange it some day for a crown
And exchange it some day for a crown
Believe In Him


"Softly And Tenderly"
Softly and tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
See on the portals, he's waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me
Come home, come home
Ya who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, oh, sinner come home
Why should we teary when Jesus is pleading
Pleading for you and for me
Why should we linger and heed not his mercies
Mercies for you and for me
Come home, come home
Ya who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, oh, sinner come home
Oh, for the wonderful love he has promised
Promised for you and for me
Though we have sinn'd, he has mercy and pardon
Pardon for you and for me
Come home, come home
Ya who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, oh, sinner come home


"In The Sweet By And By"
There's a land that is fairer than day
And by faith we can see it apart
For the father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blessed
And our spirits shall sorrow no more
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
To our bountiful father above
We will offer our tribute of praise
For the glorious gift of His love
And His blessings that hallow our days
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore


"Just As I Am"
Just as I am without one plea but that Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee oh lamb of God I come I come
Just as I am and waiting not to rid my soul of one dark blot
To Thee who's blood can cleanse each spot oh lamb of God I come I come
Just as I am Lord Thou tossed about with many a conflict and many a doubt
Fightings fears within and without oh lamb of God I come I come
Just as I am Thou wilt receive will dwell come pardon cleanse relieve
Because Thy promise I believe oh lamb of God I come I come


"Farther Along"
Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong
Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
When death has come and taken our loved ones
It leaves our home so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year
Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by


"When The Roll Is Called Up Yonder"
When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
When the saved diverse shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
Let us lay before the Master from the dawn till setting sun
Let us talk of all his wonderous love and care
And when all of life is over and our work on earth is done
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder
(When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there)


"Amazing Grace"
Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed
When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we'd first begun


"At The Cross"
Alas and did saviour bleed and did my sov'reign die
Would he devote that sacred head for such a worm as I
At the cross at the cross where I first saw the light
And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day
Was it for crimes that I have done he groaned upon the tree
Amazing pity grace unknown and love beyond degree
At the cross at the cross where I first saw the light
And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day
But drops of grief cannot repay the debt of love I owe
Here lord I give myself away it's all that I can do
At the cross at the cross where I first saw the light
And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day
At the cross at the cross where I first saw the light
And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day


"Have Thine Own Way, Lord"
Have Thine own way, Lord
Thou art the Potter, I am the clay
Mold me and make me after Thy will
While I am waiting, yielded and still
Have Thine own way, Lord
Search me and try me, Master, today
Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now
As in Thy presence humbly I bow
Have Thine own way, Lord
Wounded and weary, help me, I pray
Power, all power, surely is Thine
Touch me and heal me, Savior divine
Have Thine own way, Lord
Hold o'er my being absolute sway
Fill with Thy Spirit 'till all shall see
Christ only, always, living in me


"Nasty Dan"
Nasty Dan was the meanest man I ever knew
He's stomp and scream and be real mean the whole day through
He'd frown a bunch he ate nails for lunch and he'd never laugh
He'd growl and yell and I hard tell that he never took a bath
Nasty Dan was a nasty man
Hard to understand that Nasty Dan
Now Nasty Dan was a nasty man the whole day long
He'd go where he could he'd try real good to make things go wrong
He'd jump for joy when a little boy would trip and fall
And the only words that he ever said were I don't like you at all
Nasty Dan was a nasty man
Hard to understand that Nasty Dan
Now a real interesting thing that I want you to know about is this here
Because it's the most important thing it concerns a girl and things like that
Now Nasty Pearl was a nasty girl that met Dan somehow
She said you like me rotten as can be let's get married now
So they went and they did and had a nasty kid
And I must confess that Dan pretty much leaves everyone alone now
And he doesn't bother anybody anymore cause he just lives in his nasty ol' house
With his nasty ol' wife and his nasty ol' kid in nasty happiness
Nasty Dan was a nasty man
Hard to understand that Nasty Dan


"One And One Makes Two"
Oh the number one is not my favorite number
Cause one means only me and there's no you
But one plus one you see makes two that's you and me
And it's more fun when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one makes two at least I'm pretty sure they do
Oh yes it's true one and one makes two
Now let me show you what I mean
Now you say you want to play upon a seesaw
You're all alone and you don't know what to do
Well just go and find a friend and sit him on the other end
You'll have more fun when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one
Now you say you want to play a game of baseball
And you look around and there's no one but you
Well just find someone you know and he will catch the ball you throw
You'll have more fun when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one
Now there's the best reason of all that I like to number two right here
Now everyone needs somebody to share with
To love and help and care for through and through
And there's no one that I've known who can share or love alone
It's a lot nicer when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one
I said it's true one and one makes two

"Little Magic Glasses"
I wish I had a pair of little magic glasses
That I could see the future just by lookin' through
Then I could know what road tomorrow's gonna take me down
And I could see if I'll be walkin' down that road with you
I would keep my little magic glasses hidden
I would let nobody else see what I see
And everyone would want to know how I can know what lies ahead
And they'll wonder when I say tomorrow I see you with me
But if I see into the future that I'm on the road alone
And where the way was sunny, now there's only rain
I'll put them in a box and seal it with a lock
And I'll never take my little magic glasses out again
I will put them in a box and seal it with a lock
And I'll never take my little magic glasses out again
And I'll never take my little magic glasses out again


"Miss Tara"
Where are you going Miss Tara, Miss Tara
Where are you going Miss Tara Joan
Yesterday when you played on the swing and the trampoline
You're already thinkin' of a life of your own
And I turned around twice and you're already gone
Who will you marry Miss Tara, Miss Tara
Who will you marry Miss Tara Joan
Will he have wealth and will he have fame
I'm sure too you're wonderin' just who he will be
Well, that's your decision, it's not up to me
I hope you'll be happy Miss Tara, Miss Tara
I hope you'll be happy Miss Tara Joan
And that you will stay with me till you're a woman
And wise to the world before you're off on your own
You're my last baby girl and I'll be so alone


"Dinosaur Song"
Dinosaurs lived a long time ago
They were terrible lizards, don't you know
Some ate plants and some ate meat
Some ate fish and some ate beasts
One was called Diplodocus
One was bigger than your school bus
One was called a Triceratops
Three horns to stop anything that hops
Now can't you just see yourself walking along
Leading your pet Trachadon or feeding your Brontosaurus Rex
Or scratching your Diplodocus neck
Or riding on a Stegosaurus back or swimming in a Brachiosaurus track
Oh what a time and oh what a fun
Play and tag with your Iguanondon
And if we had dinosaurs
Now could they get along with a horse and a cow
Well, I wish they hadn't become extinct
Dinosaurs would be nice pets and friends
To have around to run outside
And play with everyday, don't you think


"Tiger Whitehead"
Wild blackberries bloomin' in the thickest on the mountain
Sheep shire and water cress are growin' round the fountain
Where a big black bear is drinkin' lappin' water like a dog
Tiger Whitehead's in the bed sleepin' like a log
Tomorrow he'll see bear tracks seven intches wide
And by sundown he'll be bringin' in the hide
Pretty Sally Garland comin' down the mountain side
Where Tiger Whitehead's tryin' to nap a mill at the mill
She sits down on a bearskin and she says you'll be my man
I'll have me the best bearhunter in the hills
A wild child was Tiger Whitehead and they say he killed
Ninety
Once he left two bearcubs orphaned but he brought 'em right on home
And Sally nursed the two bearcubs upon her breast
Tiger now is eighty
And the bears he killed now numbered ninety
Some fellers trapped the bears but Tiger said just let him go
If he ain't running wild he won't be mine
But at  night when the wind howls cross eastern hills of Tennessee
And when the lightnin' flashes there's the strange thing that the people say they see
An old grey headed ghost runnin' through the mountains there
It's Tiger Whitehead after his one hundreth bear
Wild blackberries bloomin' in the thickest on the mountain
Sheep shire and water cress are growin' round the fountain
Where a big black bear is drinkin' lappin' water like a dog
Tiger Whitehead's in the bed sleepin' like a log
Tomorrow he'll see bear tracks seven intches wide
And by sundown he'll be bringin' in the hide


"Call Of The Wild"
Bayou bayou bayou bayou
Now here's a little tale about a flock of geese
Lookin' for a home and lookin' for a peace
But before they're safely in the southern sand
They gotta watch out for the critter called man
There's a goose and a gander and a goslin' child
Headin' on south at the call of the wild
Honk and holler as we go gonna see the Gulf of Mexico
Way up high don't fly low the long toms will get you from the old bayou
Well the wind from the north it chills you to the bone
And the call of the wild is callin' me come home
I'll lead my band of geese a marry trip we'll navigate that mighty Mississipp'
Honk and holler as we go
Bayou bayou bayou bayou
Honk and holler as we go
My pappy led this band of twenty
He made one fatal slip and he flew too low the long tom's got him from the old bayou
Honk and holler as we go


"Little Green Fountain"
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
Oh, the water is cool and the water is blue
A drink for me and a drink for you
Yes, the water is cool and the water is blue
A drink for me and a drink for you
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
Oh, the water is cool and the water is deep
Take off our shoes and cool our feet
Yes, the water is cool and the water is deep
Take off our shoes and cool our feet
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
Come along with me to the pasture now
We'll watch the wind blow on the cows
Come along with me to the pasture now
We'll watch the wind blow on the cows
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water


"Old Shep"
When I was a lad
And old shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd play
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way
I remember the time at the old swimmin hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pull me out
As the years fast did roll
Old shep he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can do no more for him jim
With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at sheps faithful head
I just couldnt do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead
He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see
Old shep he has gone
Where the good doggies go
And no more with old shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven
Theres one thing I know
Old shep has a wonderful home


"The Timber Man"
Many, many years ago
When this land was young
A lot of our country was covered
By big tall beautiful trees
And men had to have the trees
To make wood, to build houses
Make furniture with, to make boats
Even to make paper with
So as more and more people came
More wood was needed
So more and more trees
Were cut down
And the man that lived in the forest
And cut down the trees
Was called the Timber man
Well, my world is green and dark and dumb
My home is in the loggin' camp
All week I cut down the mighty trees
Saturday I get to do as I please
I give the man more than his hire
And he'll never know it if I tire
Show me the toughest tree around
The Timber man will bring it down
Swing it hard, cut it clean
No halfway or in
Move when the axe is in my hand
Make way for the Timber man
Yeah, he was a mighty big tough man usually
That Timber man that lived in that forest
And cut down those big trees
Well, they say there's sawdust in my brain
And don't get caught out in the rain
I got stump water in my blood
The sweat from my brow turns the ground to mud
When the men don't know how to fell a tree
The one they'll come and ask is me
I'll mark my spot and I'll take my stand
The tree's gonna fall for the Timber man
Swing it hard, cut it clean
No halfway or in
Move when the axe is in my hand
Make way for the Timber man
And when they're cuttin' on a tree
And it's just about ready to fall
The man yells out timber, timber


"Let There Be Country"
Tom T Hall is forty now and so is Bobby Bare
Willie Nelson's gettin' grey and Faron Young don't care
But the young ones keep on coming on the old are slow to go
Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song
No one picks like Bill Monroe and don't George Jones sing great
I can tell that the people care by the people at my gate
Webb Pierce invites the tourists in and Ray keeps them away
Let there be country and let the country play
Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song
Ernest Tubb's got all of the soul he's had for all these years
Porter Wagoner's recitation still bring me to tears
And when they do play Kitty Wells you know she's still the Queen
Let there be country and keep the country green
Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song
Little Jimmy Dickens still sends shivers through the crowd
Mother Maybelle whispers now but the heart comes through real loud
Gene Autry don't sing no more good old Tex Ritter's gone
And somewhere downtown Nashville a young man just got off the bus
With a guitar in his hands a pocket full of songs
A lot of talent and a heart full of hope
And he's gonna be the next big country star and the country wheels roll on
Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song
Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song


"One Piece At A Time"
Well, I left Kentucky back in '49
An' went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on cadillacs
Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black
One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand
[CHORUS]
I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
Cause I'll have the only one there is a round
So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears
Now, I never considered myself a thief
GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all of the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home
Now, up to now my plan went all right
Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong
The transmission was a '53
And the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone
So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help with an A
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlight' was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on
The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got thru
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said
Honey, take me for a spin
So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
Cause to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds
[CHORUS]
I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
Cause I'll have the only one there is around
[Spoken]
Ugh
This is the COTTON MOUTH
In the PSYCHO
Huh, This is the COTTON MOUTH
And negatory on the cost of this mow
You might say I went right up to the factory
And picked it up, it's cheaper that way
Ugh


"In A Young Girl's Mind"
Hand me my guitar there's a song that I was singing
Back when I was young and I had a good time
Looking for love in the misty waters of the seas that roll in a young girl's mind
Only in shadows and lonely at night she turns to you softly you turn on the light
You use her abuse her and you know it ain't right to treat one who loves you so badly
When she's doing the best that she can you know she's doing the best that she can
Do you believe in dreams do you believe in dreamers
Hoping that you'll find what you're looking for
You don't have to worry cause there's a bright tomorrow
In the dreams that roll in a young girl's mind
Only in shadows
So hand me my guitar
Of the seas that roll in a young girl's mind


"Mountain Lady"
Mountain lady do you sit on your front porch in the cool of the day
Mountain lady did you think your kids would ever come back to stay
Mountain lady does the columbine still twine around your door
And did you ever get a rug
To cover the cracks where my diaper drug on your wooden floor
Oh you appalachian lady once i was your little baby
And you rocked me in your homemade rockin' chair
Since i heard the wild goose callin' i have done a lot of fallin'
Mountain lady someday i'll come to you there
Mountain lady does the country church bell ring on sunday morn
Mountain lady do you still wear that old apron ragged and torn
Mountain lady on winter nights before our old fireplace
As you look into the flame do you ever call my name and do you see my face
Oh you appalachian lady
Mountain lady


"Michigan City Howdy Do"
Well johnson van dyke grigsby was paroled in '89
He never walked on a carpet never tasted dinner wine
His old eyes were slowly fadin' as he walked out of the gate
And he breathed the first free air he'd breathed since 19
Howdy do michigan city you're sure pretty sight
But I know there's bigger citties and more excitin' nights
But I think your girls're pretty and I love your children too
Michigan city indiana howdy do michigan city indiana howdy do
Michigan city indiana howdy do
Filled with the joy of freedom he didn't know that he was old
Cause time don't really matter when it's bubblin' in your soul
Well I don't think he was bitter cause he sure had a smile
And down the streets of michigan city he walked his first free miles
Howdy do michigan city


"Sold Out Of Flagpoles"
I walked down past the courthouse square three blocks or maybe four
Run into my old friend there who runs a handy hardware store
I said mornin' Lon what's the good word
He said Abraham Lincoln Lone Ranger Mickey Mouse and I'm sold out of flagpoles
I popped the top off a soda pop laid a quarter on the bar
I said inflation is a dirty dog my payday sure ain't goin' far
Liberty said Lonnie E Pluribus Uni in God we trust and I'm sold out of flagpoles
I said hey Lonnie did you see Evel Knievel jumpin' on TV
Jumped 13 buses with his machine reckon he could jump 14
No doubt said Lonnie winners keep on winnin'
Even losers win sometimes and I'm sold out of flagpoles
Ain't this been a year I said for frost and blight and flood and drought
Twice as many tornados reckon it's all caused by fallout
No it's the season said Lonnie they change
Wind's gonna blow always did and I'm sold out of flagpoles
Hey what d'you think about the sheriff's daughter
Runnin' off with the preacher's son
The sheriff's wife had to hold him back from goin' after them with his gun
Boys and girls said Lonnie will get together
Everything's normal and I'm sold out of flagpoles
And I'm sold out of flagpoles sold out of flagpoles sold out of flagpoles


"Committed To Parkview"
There's a man across the hall who sits staring at the floor
He thinks he's Hank Williams
There's a girl in 203, who stops by to visit me
And she talks about her songs and the star that she should be
There are lots of special people staying in or passing through
And for one thing or another, committed to Parkview
There's a girl in 307, coming down on Thorazine
And a superstar's ex
There's a boy just down below me, who's the son of some well
He was brought in by his mother, 'cos his daddy's always gone
There's a bum from down on Broadway and then a few quite well
Who have withdrawn from the rat race and committed to Parkview
There's a girl who cries above me, loud enough to wake the dead
They don't know what she has taken that has scrambled up her head
There's a writer and a singer who has tried and tried and tried
They just brought him in this morning, an attempted suicide
There are those that never made it, those that did but now are through
Some came of their own good choosing: some committed to Parkview
They wake us about 6: 30, just before the morning meal
While they're taking blood pressure, they ask us how we feel
And I always say
Fantastic
And then they give me my injection and I go right back to sleep
And my days are kind of foggy and my nights are dreamy too
But they're taking good care of me: committed to Parkview


"Daughter Of A Railroad Man"
Leaving in a cloud of burning cinders cinders from a fire of love gone out
Never looking back when she's highbolling
She's the daughter of a railroam man no doubt
Waking in a new bed every morning breaking in a new heart every night
Up and running while the world is sleeping
She's the daughter of a railroam man alright
She is long and sleek and made for moving she's outward bound at any time she can
She won't be staying long in any station she's the daughter of a railroam man
Cries out in the night when she gets lonely you can bet she won't be lonely long
On down the line someone waits her arrival and the daughter of a railroad man is gone
She is long and sleek


"Love Has Lost Again"
I guess we're over and it's all been said before
But I still want you though there's no reason anymore
I can't remember when you and I began
It makes no difference cause love has lost again
If there's a reason we forgot it long ago
And if there's an answer it's one I'll never know
The price of giving I just don't understand
But it's collected and love has lost again
All that's left now is the closing of the door
It sounds so final but I don't listen anymore
It's not the last time that I'll break instead of bend
But for the moment love has lost again
It's not the last time that I'll break instead of bend
But for the moment love has lost again


"Go On Blues"
Go on blues go on lonesome
Get your dark clouds off of me
Go on blues go on troubles
Turn loose of me set me free
I've been down through that valley with you
Now I've found me somebody who loves me too
Go on blues go away from me
Go on by me go on blues
I've been down through that valley with you
Now I've found me somebody who loves me too
Go on blues go away from me
Go on by me go on blues
Yeah go on blues go on by me
Get away from me go on blues


"I Will Dance With You"
I sang your song before you ever came along but that don't mean I'll sing along
I've never waltzed the home sweet home but I will dance with you
I'd spread my wings before you ever learned to fly like flocks of wild geese in the sky
See one more shore before they die I will fly with you
With you I'll dream before we ever fall asleep the dreams you always hope to keep
And though they may fall to our feet I will dream with you
I'd drink your wine and taste the sweetness of your fine
And if I haven't aged with time before the days begin to twine I will age with you
I sang your song before you ever came along but that don't mean I'll sing along
I've never waltzed the home sweet home but I will dance with you


"The Last Gunfighter Ballad"
The old gunfighter stood on the porch
and stared into the sun
And relived all the old days
back when he was livin' by the gun
When deadly games of pride were played
and livin' was mistakes not made
And the thought of the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
The thought of the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
And it's always keep your back to the sun
And you can almost feel the weight of that gun
It's faster than snakes or a blink of the eye
And it's a time for all slow men to die
His eyes get squinty and he's straight as a log
and he empties his gun at the dirty dog
And he's hit by the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Hit by the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Now the burn of a bullet is only a scar
And he's back in his chair in front of a bar
And the streets are empty and the blood's all dried
The dead are dust and the whiskey's inside
So buy him a drink and lend him an ear
He's nobody's fool and he's the only one here
Who remembers the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Remembers the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Said I stood in that street before it was paved
I learned to shoot or be shot before I could shave
And I did it all for the money and the fame
Noble was nothing but feelin' no shame
And nothing was sacred but stayin' alive
And all that I learned from a Colt .45
Was to cuss the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Cuss the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Now he's just an old man that nobody believes
Says he's a gunfighter the last of this breed
And there's ghosts in the street seekin' revenge
Callin' him out to the lunatic fringe
He's out in the traffic now checking the sun
And he's killed by a car as he goes for his gun
So much for the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
So much for the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke


"Far Side Banks Of Jordan"
I believe my steps are growing wearier each day
Still I've got a journey on my mind
Lures of this old world have ceased to make me want to stay
and my one regret is leaving you behind
If it proves to be his will that I'm the first to go
And some how I've a feeling it will be
When it comes time to travel likewise don't feel lost
For I will be the first one that you'll see
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be waiting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming I will rise up with a shout
And come running through the shallow waters reaching for your hand
Through this life we've laboured hard to earn our meager fare
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes
I'll just rest here on this shore and turn my eyes away
And then you'll come then we'll see paradise


"Give It Away"
Well I woke up this morning I had something on my face
It was still there when I brushed my teeth still there when I shaved
I showed it to my neighbor and he broke into a grin I gave it away I gave it away
Smiles don't cost money give it away give it away
Maybe all you have is just a kind word you can say give it away give it away
I woke up this morning with a song in my heart
I hummed it all through coffee and it gave my day a start
I took my song to work with me and I sang it for my friend
I gave it away I gave it away
Yes Jesus loves me give it away give it away
Maybe all you have is just a kind word you can say give it away give it away
Don't think people do not care I know they care a lot
Don't be bashful of somebody give it all you've got
Understandin' means more than you ever thought it could to give it away give it away
Love someone sometime give it away give it away
Maybe all you have is just a kind word you can say give it away give it away
Give it away give it away


"You're So Close To Me"
You're so close to me your body and your soul're now a part of me
We are one now no one could ever know just what you are to me
You're so close to me your deepest darkest secrets all belong to me
I am you you are me you're so close to me
And in the morning I can look into your eyes and know your feelings
We can talk to one another without speeking
And if it's lovin' that you're gonna know it
Your sweet eyes show it every morning
You're so close to me your body and your soul're now a part of me
We are one now no one could ever know just what you are to me
You're so close to me your deepest darkest secrets all belong to me
I am you you are me you're so close to me
And in the evening I can feel your gentle softness without touchin' you
I don't need another thing I've got so much in you
And if it's lovin' that you're gonna give it
I'm gonna live it every evening
You're so close to me your body and your soul're now a part of me
We are one now no one could ever know just what you are to me
You're so close to me your deepest darkest secrets all belong to me
I am you you are me you're so close to me


"City Jail"
City jail city jail like an old scared dog I tuck my tail
Bow my head and not a careless word is said
Gotta sleep on the floor once more at city jail
Well I was hangin' round the bus station
Mindin' my own business like I always do
When I saw this waitress in this bus station cafe
And I thought I check out the action like I always do
I'd give her the bad eye and made a few choices personal comments
About what I thought mine and her possibilities could be for a team
When she called the badge on me
The badge grabbed me by the arm and he said
What are you doin' hangin' around here for
And I said for whatever's goin' around
City jail city jail
He said no what I mean is what are you doin'
Sayin' things like that to that lady
And I said what's that lady's doin' with purple hair
Well the badge said you're smart alec and I said no I ain't I'm just hungry
And he said you're actin' like a smart alec
And I said no that's how I act when I get hungry
City jail city jail
Well he put me outside in a dark corner
And before you could say hypocrite he hit me on the head
And I said oooh don't hit me on the head
I can't protect myself with the handcuffs on
Please don't hit me on the head then he hit me again he hit me again he hit me again
And I said oh oh oh oh oh please don't stand on my feet when you hit me
I break my ankles when I fall
City jail city jail
Well about that time they threw me in the wagon
And that waitress walked out with a sailor
I said hey you not you I'm talkin' to the purple people eater
Yes you lady quote you're the cause of it all unquote
Then she said to that sailor said get me away from that horrible man Harry
City jail city jail
Well as they hauled me away I said everybody have a nice evening
The Last Gunfighter Ballad


"Cindy I Love You"
We never really got right down to talking we couldn't seem to find the place or time
Distance in the miles between us made us kinda stranger
And it added to the distance already there between our minds
And Cindy I love you yes I love you yes I love you
And when I can't think of anything to say
Don't be readin' something in my mind that isn't there
Remember Cindy I love you anyway
I look at you and wonder what you're thinkin'
I'm sure you felt the same a time or two
We must both remember that true love sure costs us nothin'
You just told me your affection and I owed the same to you
And Cindy I love you
Remember Cindy I love you anyway


"Ballad Of Barbara"
In a southern town where I was born
That's where I got my education
I worked in the fields and I walked in the woods
And I wondered at creation
I recall the sun in a sky of blue
And the smell of green things growin'
And the seasons chang'd and I lived each day
Just the way the wind was blowin'
Then I heard of a cultured city life
Breath takin' lofty steeples
And the day I called myself a man
I left my land and my people
And I rambled north and I rambled east
And I tested and I tasted
And a girl or two, took me round and round
But they always left me wasted
In a world that's all concrete and steel
With nothin' green ever growin'
Where the buildings hide the risin' sun
And they blocked the free winds from blowin
Where you sleep all day and you wake all night
To a world of drink and laughter
I met that girl that I was sure would be
The one that I was after
In a soft blue gown and formal tux
Beneath that lofty steeple
He said
Do you Barbara, take this man
Will you be one of his people
And she said
I will
and she said
I do
And the world looked mighty pretty
And we lived in a fancy downtown flat
Cause she loved the noisy city
But the days grew cold beneath a yellow sky
And I longed for green things growin'
And the thoughts of home and the people there
But she'd not agreed to goin'
Then her hazel eyes turned away from me
With a look that wasn't pretty
And she turned into concrete and steel
And she said
I'll take the city
Now the cars go by on the interstate
And my pack is on my shoulder
But I'm goin' home, where I belong
Much wiser now and older


"That Silver Haired Daddy Of Mine"
In a vine covered
Shack in the mountains
Bravely fighting
The battle of time
There's a dear one
Who's wept
Through life's sorrows
It's that silver
Haired daddy of mine
If I could recall
All the heartaches
Dear ole daddy
I've caused you to bear
If I could erase
Those lines from your face
And bring back
The gold to your hair
If God would but
Grant me the power
Just to turn back
The pages of time
I would give all
I own just to put a tone
To that silver
Haired daddy of mine
If I could recall
All the heartaches
Dear ole daddy
I've caused you to bear
If I could erase
Those lines from your face
And bring back
The gold to your hair
If God would but
Grant me the power
Just to turn back
The pages of time
I would give all
I own just to put a tone
To that silver
Haired daddy of mine
The Last Gunfighter Ballad


"Hit The Road And Go"
I woke up this afternoon, looked into your eyes
And somethin' was as wrong as if the sun forgot to rise
I picked up a road map and I checked a few good places that I know
And if you're no longer givin', I believe I'll hit the road and go
I just got the feelin' that the fire was burnin' out
Cause the air was turnin' colder every time you came about
And a flame won't take a fannin' if the last reserve of love is runnin' low
So since I've gotta button up, I believe I'll hit the road and go
Country road 6
Life out of the interstate is very much alive
There's magic in the mountains and music in the valleys down below
And my song ain't through playin' yet so I believe I'll hit the road and go
Good morning to you sunshine, good morning to you rain
The windshield wiper's rhythm keeps me singin' down the pain
Today I'm gonna miss you less if I miss you at all
You'll never know, you'll never know
This rambler has cut all the ties and pulled up stakes to hit the road and go
This rambler has cut all the ties and pulled up stakes to hit the road and go


"If It Wasn't For The Wabash River"
Fish ain't bitin' but I don't really care and don't hurry
Like that Wabash River there I'd be drinkin'
Or laying dead somewhere if it wasn't for the Wabash River
If it wasn't for the Wabash River and this willow tree and my pole and a line
I'd be goin' crazy as an Indiana cyclone
Drownin' memories of her and cryin' cryin' cryin'
If it wasn't for the Wabash River I'd be goin' out off my mind
It's so peaceful sittin' here beneath my tree Lord I need her
Like she often needed me life ain't worth it
Just as far as I can see if it wasn't for the Wabash River
If it wasn't for the Wabash River
[Rambler]
Look out man alive
Fifty
And you go fifty
[Fisherman]
Man I must be nuts I just got back from California
All that time out there chasin' after her
[Rambler]
Well she must be worth a round trip
[Fisherman]
Worth it
You know there was a time I'd run naked through the snow just to touch that woman
[Rambler]
But you wouldn't now ha
[Fisherman]
Where we're at anyway
[Rambler]
I don't know I believe that's the Platte River you want to go fishin' again
[Fisherman]
I had enough fishin'
[Rambler]
It's still a long way to California you know
[Fisherman]
You know I just might change my mind before we get there
[Rambler]
You sound like you got no control over whether you go or not
[Fisherman]
That's just it what is it about a woman that makes such a dummy out of a man
She was wild even when she was lovin' me man
I knew tomorrow it'd likely be somebody else she would be with
But you know just that idea that the next day she could be lovin' me again
That's what kept me on her tail chasin' after all the time
She really was poison but I guess it was good poison
Look at me here I go again hopin' for another dose of that sweet poison she had man
Did you ever have a woman like that
[Rambler]
Yeah I guess I have
[Fisherman]
You know what I mean
[Rambler]
My woman's a lady
[Fisherman]
A lady
[Rambler]
A lady will give you the best lovin' you ever had
I don't care what you had in California but even a lady's love can burn out though
But what I mean is a good woman a kind sweet considerate understandin' woman
That likes to be treated like she treats you
And if that ain't bull the better she gives love the more she wants to give
I know what I'm talkin' about a lady
Lovin's better is a lovin' heart's goin' to give another and a lady loves to give
Mine did for a little while


"Lady"
Lady your arms're always warm and your bed was always ready when I came
Lady in the middle of the night
You would open up when you'd hear me call your name
And you were always there to see the turning of my key
And your laughing voice to me was like a song
Lady your spirit's sweet and free it's hanging on with me now that I'm gone
Lady you spoke softly and kind and you never had a word to criticize
Lady you know I love you so even more than I ever let you be alive
And day or night I knew that I could bring it all to you
And if I was wrong you'd never put me down
Lady so much I could say but I can't find the way to write it down
Can't find the way to write it down
The days and the miles roll by
In Denver the Rambler and the Fisherman are tired of the road
And ready for whatever the city and the night have to offer
They check into a cheap hotel and go right to the bar downstairs
It's Saturday night and the city's alive
They've been in the bar four hours now and it's nearly closin' time
[Fisherman]

[Fisherman]
That ain't beer honey that's Coors
[Rambler]
Well the barman's right
Beer the bar girls too much beer I must be seein' things
I saw you sittin' on a barstool lady and I looked up and you were gone
You didn't like beer either did you lady liked champagne neither did you lady
In Denver Colorado fancy town for a fancy lady like you
Hey maybe she's out there somewhere hey lady hahaha
Hey I ran maybe she ran maybe I did see her downstairs
Maybe she's drownin' her blues like I did
Hey maybe I did see her down there havin' a ball somewhere comin' up to me
Yeah maybe she'll be comin' yeah maybe she'll be comin'


"After The Ball"
I hear people laughing on the corner by the square
The neon flickers on my wall and I know you're out there
I've been in here a listening for your footsteps down the hall
And I'll be waiting for you after the ball
After the ball is over, after the ball
If you cannot stand I got a place for you to fall
The blinds are drawn and I have turned the clock
I'll be waiting for you after the ball
Loving you is a sweet addiction I need only you
Just as long as you come back we'll do what you want to
Give the night your laughter, but I'll have you after all
I'll be waiting for you after the ball
After the ball is over, after the ball
If you cannot stand I got a place for you to fall
The blinds are drawn and I have turned the clock
I'll be waiting for you after the ball


"No Earthly Good"
Come hear me good brothers, come here one and all
Don't brag about standing or you'll surely fall
You're shinin' your light and shine it you should
But you're so heavenly minded you're no earthly good
No earthly good you are no earthly good
You're so heavenly minded you're no earthly good
You're shinin' your light yes and shine it you should
You're so heavenly minded and you're no earthly good
Come hear me good sisters you're salt of the earth
If your salt isn't salted then what is it worth
You could give someone a cool drink if you would
You're so heavenly minded and you're no earthly good
No earthly good you are no earthly good
You're so heavenly minded you're no earthly good
You could give someone a cool drink if you would
You're so heavenly minded and you're no earthly good
If you're holdin' heaven then spread it around
There are hungry hands reaching up here from the ground
Move over and share the high ground where you stood
So heavenly minded you're no earthly good
No earthly good you are no earthly good
You're so heavenly minded you're no earthly good
Move over and share the high ground where you stood
So heavenly minded and you're no earthly good
No earthly good


"A Wednesday Car"
The assembly line is runnin' slow on Monday
They've been livin' it up and layin' up Saturday and Sunday
On Tuesday they're about to come around
But they still feel bad and they're kinda down
And mad cause they've got four more day before the weekend rolls around
On Wednesday they're feelin' fine again
And they're workin' like a dog and diggin' in
Tryin' to do everything they should puttin' 'em cars together good
And I got me a car that was made on Wednesday on Wednesday
If you're gonna boy yourself a new car
You just better hope you're lucky enough to get one made on Wednesday
On Thursday the weekend is in sight
And they're in a hurry and they don't do nothing right
Friday is the worst day of the week that's the day they make lemons dogs and freaks
If your car was made on Friday friend you'll soon be in the creek
Cause it's payday and the loafin' has begun
Lord them Friday cars just hope you don't get one
Monday Tuesday Thursday and Friday
Are all bad days and the only try day is Wednesday
And my car was made on Wednesday on Wednesday
If your car wasn't made on Wednesday I'd advise you not to even leave home any


"My Cowboy's Last Ride"
The cowboy's lady is cryin' tonight cause the cowboy is out on the range
Runnin' and ramblin' and chasin' some stray and good cowboys don't ever change
I tried to hold him in the home corral but the grasses were greener outside
So I'm gonna sit here in front of this door
And I've loaded up my cowboy's fourty
When the smoke clears there'll be a new brand on his eyes
This is my cowboy's last ride
Oh I hate to see him go but I won't be stayin' home cryin'
I hate to watch him die but this is my cowboy's last ride
Cowboy remembers the old trails we rode and he's back in the saddle tonight
This time I'm lettin' the homefires burn out and I'm leavin' when I blow out his light
Cause I still remember good waterin' holes and the places that are open and wide
And I have decied he won't put me down a filly should be free for horsin' around
And I will no longer be hobbled and tied this is my cowboy's last ride
Oh I hate to see him go but I won't be stayin' home cryin'
I hate to watch him die but this is my cowboy's last ride


"Calilou"
Well I'm finally goin' back to Louisiana
Runnin' and thumbin' all the way
That started out way out in California
I been makin' bout five hundred miles a day
I covered all the beaches on the west coast
From Mexico Crason City Bay
But Calilou was not in California
That's where her daddy came from by the way
And by the way her mother was a cajun
She came from New Orleans I've heard her say
And it's just like a girl to wanna see her mama
So I might find her there along the way
Calilou Calilou well they should have call you restless
Well they should have call you drifter
Yeah they should have call you trouble instead of Calilou
I reacall the first time that I saw her
I picked her up near Phoenix in my car
Just another beauty seekin' fame and fortune
And I told her if she should be a movie star
The next time I saw her was Tucumcari
She served my bowl of chili with a smile
I said it's been a year since I last saw you
Wonder how'd you like to share a few good miles
Well the justice of the peace was very sleepy
I held her in my arms a whole night long
I whispered words like settle down and family
And when I woke up my Calilou was gone
Calilou Calilou well they should have call you restless
Well they should have call you drifter
Yeah they should have call you trouble instead of Calilou
Calilou Calilou well they should have call you restless
Well they should have call you drifter
Yeah they should have call you trouble instead of Calilou
It's a long way to New Orleans
Well I got plenty of time
Me too you know it's lot of fun just seein' what the next day has to offer
You never know what round the next bend
Or what we're gonna find either
Do you know what I just wonder how long a man has to look before he finds himself
I just got the feelin' that the fire was burnin' out
Cause the air was turnin' colder every time you came about
And a flame won't take a fannin' if the last reserve of love is runnin' low
So since I've gotta button up I believe I'll hit the road and go
Country road 6
Life out of the interstate is very much alive
There's magic in the mountains and music in the valleys down below
And my song ain't through playin' yet so I believe I'll hit the road and go


"I Would Like To See You Again"
I was sittin' here thinking about old times some old times some old friends
And suddenly it crossed my mind that I would like to see you again
Remember how we used to walk and talk walk and talk holding hands
Said we loved each other I recall made a lot of future plans
But the years have come and gone and a whole lot has happened since then
But tonight babe your memory's awfully strong on my mind
And I would like to see you again
It's funny how an old flame comes back come on back make you blue
But I just saw a picture of a railroad track and some old shack and me and you
Guess I'd better straighten out my mind straighten it out go to bed
And pray that I don't dream about old times some old times gone and dead
But the years have come and gone


"Lately"
Lately I've been thinking that you don't love me at all
Lately I've been readin' and the writin' on the wall
Is sayin' looks like you'll be going and I've no sure way of knowing
But somehow that's what I've been thinking lately
Lately you've been saying things that I don't understand
Lately you look through me as if I'm another man
Instead of your old one and only I'm beginnin' to get lonely
I've been feeling you'll be leaving lately
You might as well just stop it now cause I already know
You wouldn't hurt me less if you just go ahead and go
You know your heart's already gone so you might as well go on
Things have not been working for us lately things have not been working for us lately


"I Wish I Was Crazy Again"
I met an old friend this morning
And I stopped him and called him by name
I said
The years haven't changed you
But he said
Good Lord, how you've changed
So we stood there and talked on the corner
And remembered the good times we had
Then he asked if we're happy together
And I only smiled and I said
Yes, she keeps me off the streets
And she keeps me out of trouble
Sometimes at night, Lord, when I hear the wind
I wish I was crazy again, yes, I wish I was crazy again
Then we stopped in at a tavern
We had us a round or two
We called ourselves old desperado's, old desperado's
As old friends are likely to do
We sat for a while and remembered
Then he said
Let's have just one more
I said
I'd sure like to join you
But best be goin' on home
Yes, she keeps me off the streets
She keeps me off the streets


"Who's Gene Autry"
Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
Back in the saddle again
My little boy said
Daddy, who's Gene Autry
His old movie was comin' on TV
And I said
Let me tell you about him, son
And I took him upon my knee
Why, when I was a little boy about your size
And just about every Saturday night
When I could scrape up a dime for the movies
And when my Daddy said alright
I'd be right downtown at the picture show
Like everybody else that could
To see a handsome man
On a big fine stallion goin' about, doin' good
Singin'
Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
Put him back in the saddle again
Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way
Back in the saddle again
Well, he could ride his horse and play his guitar
And sing all at the same time
And I was ridin' right along there beside him
On that broomstick pony of mine
And you know his pistol never ran out of bullets
When the bad guys had to be stopped
And somehow his bullets never drew any blood
But the bad guys dropped when he shot
Yeah, old Gene was an image of justice
And goodness and purity
And in the eyes of a poor, little country boy
He made the world look better to me
Singin'
Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
Put him back in the saddle again
Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way
Back in the saddle again
And you know the way
He rescued the rancher's daughter
He'd sent a thrill right up the aisle
And the endin' would always send us home
With a good victorious smile
Now you ask me, 'Who's Gene Autry
Well, son, go ahead and watch the show
And then ride off into the sunset with him
Like I did forty years ago
Singin'
Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
Put him back in the saddle again
Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way
Back in the saddle again


"Hurt So Bad"
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way


"I Don't Think I Could Take You Back Again"
Now you don't have to worry about me babe
Just hook 'em up and head on out to the places where you've been
Go ahead and fly like an eagle in the sky
And when you land you'll find I'm still your friend
But I don't think I could take you back again
Ain't no need to bother about me babe
Someone will come along and she will take me by the hand
Together we will walk where the grass is green and new
And I'll even think about you now and then
But I don't think I could take you back again
Hey where you going you can't get there without me so goodbye go on goodbye
And remember though I'm setting you free I won't cry cry cry
I've seen you toss and turning in your sleep babe
Now your dreambags're packed you've got your ticket in your hand
When you love someone you want what's best for them
That's how it is and that's how it's always been
And I don't think I could take you back again
Hey where you going


"Abner Brown"
Every town has its town bum
I guess ours had one
Here's a song about him, I remember him fondly
Well his name was Abner Brown
I knew an old drunk named Abner Brown
And nobody knew when he came to town
But he spread good will to his fellow men
And they let him sleep in the cotton gin
He could drink more brew than an army could
But he had more friends and he did more good
Than a lot of fine fancy people in our town
So they tolerated Abner Brown
And all us kids were on his side
Cause he told us tales till our eyes grew wide
And he made us feel bout ten feet tall
Cause he had no kids but he claimed us all
And after school and on weekends
You could find me down at the cotton gin
The truest friend that I ever found was
A good old drunk named Abner Brown
Abner Brown, I wish that I could see you once again
I believe that you'd stack up with all the mighty men
I've met and known in all the low
And higher places that I've been
Thinking of you picks me up when I'm feeling down
I thank the Lord for making Abner Brown
Lord take me back to the cotton land
To Arkansas take me home again
Let me be the boy that I once have been
Let me walk that road to the cotton gin
He's probably dead many years ago
And gone the way that old drunks go
But I'd still like to sit me down
Talk to my old friend, Abner Brown
Abner Brown, I wish
I thank the Lord for making Abner Brown


"After Taxes"
I feel so good come payday
I think of all the things I'm gonna
Buy when I pick up my pay
Don't you know, but then they hand me
That little brown envelope
I peep inside, Lord I lose all hope
Cause from those total wages earned
Down to that net amount that's due
I feel the painful sense of loss between the two
There goes that bracelet for her arm
There goes that new fence for my farm
There goes that brand new Pontiac
There goes the shirt right off my back
You can dream about a honeymoon for two
You can dream but that's about all you can do
Cause by the time old Uncle Sam gets through with you
You can buy her a pair of hose
A little powder for her nose
And take her down to Sloppy Joe's for beer
And stew them are the facts after tax
You can dream about vacation in the sun
You can dream but you can't never have you one
Cause by the time your good old Uncle Sam gets done
You've got just enough for gas
To see them city limits pass
And if you get back home fourth class
I'd say you won
There goes that bracelet for her arm
There goes that new fence for my farm
Send back that short wave radio cancel that trip to Mexico
Forget that brand new Pontiac
There goes the shirt right off my back
