Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Chorus]
I change places, to prevent catchin' the cases
Races, in the faces, hall at you laces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this

[Verse 1]
The only thing hotter than my flow is the block (inhale and exhale)
That's why I left this snow biz, and got into show biz
Let's get this clear, it ain't on 'til I say it's on, (pause), it's on
I'm eatin', ya'll niggas fastin' like it's Rimadon
Bowlish way in Lebanon, know 50 the bomb
I be at the edge of the bar, sippin' a Don
I keep the bottle just in case, you never know when it's on
This worries bump, I can't go wrong, my team's too strong
You want war? I take you to war, now that my money long
Why you broke? cat's buy the by lines and fantasize
The way I'm spittin', put TV's in everything I'm sittin'
While I'm hot to death, I'm gonna say this to all you playa haters
Ya'll should hate the game, not the playas (c'mon)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I change places, to prevent catchin' the cases
Races, in the faces, hall at you laces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
(50 Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)

[Verse 2]
Everyday is bugged, niggas'll come to a club
To try to show you they a thug, instead of showing some love
Now, what you think you chump me, If I let you bump me
When I'm about to make a mill, faster than you make a G (haha)
I know I lie, it's a habit, I vow to clean the city like the mayor
And in the crack game, I'm a franchise player
Niggas be thinkin' I be out to lunch with mines
Then in crunch time, I start hittin' 'em hard with punch lines
You cats got to be sick, to think 50 can't spit
Better check my batting average, I always make hits
My flows leave these rap cats ketro (ketro), all across the metro (metro)
Plus I pack a cannon, up under my marple cannon
They fake, they look like money, but ain't worth half the cake
Have me runnin' from Jake, in a GS with bad brakes
They want to knock me take, for Christ sakes

[Chorus]
(50 Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)
I change places, to prevent catchin' the cases
Races, in the faces, hall at you laces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
(50 Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)

I change places, to prevent catchin' the cases
Races, in the faces, hall at you laces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
(50 Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)

[Verse 3]
Yo, son remember them fake playas
Who try to play us at The Shark Club in Vegas
Had them tight linen blazers, and beat up gators
Lookin' like last year's playas, (pause) 
Yeah, I could tell they dough was low
When we came through the do'
I copped a case of Cristal, and copped one bottle of Mo
From the looking through face, and the bulge in his waist, he holdin'
(Yeah he's packin', I can see his rack
The one in the middle, he a big man, I dealt with him son)
Yeah, so I expect look like they ain't had a run, since ' 81
They ain't here on a hunt for food, 
So they could catch you, some cash, and expensive jewels
I'm gonna crash 'em with this bottle if he move
I ain't the one son, my shit ain't come easy
It won't go easy, believe me

[Chorus: repeat 3X]
I change places, to prevent catchin' the cases
Races, in the faces, hall at you laces
This is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this
(50 Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)

Yo, you know what I want? I want the beat to drop right..now 
niggas be thinkin' I'm crazy right?
you are crazy..
I ain't crazy...
you are crazy....
atleast I don't think I'm crazy
I think my shit is hot, I think I'm hot
you hot but you crazy..
why they wanna?..man..I don't know...

[Verse 1]
It's the money that - makes shit get ugly
It's the money that - makes these hoes love me
It's the money that - makes niggas wanna slug me
man..I thought the money would make it all lovely
Yo, I actually write what I do or see
the felonies from day to day make me say what I say
when I die my art will be worth more than Picasso's
Don't cry for me, smile for me
and if you see them niggas that wet me, wile' for me
remember the good times, the chips we stacked
the clips we packed 
and all the bricks we cooked from coke to crack
let my tombstone read "I Tried" and from the start
everything I wrote was from my heart
so it'll always be number one on my chart
I get sensitive with my shit, don't fuck with my art
sometimes it sounds like I'm playin' but I'm sayin'
this shit is real, it ain't a game.

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
They say the good die young
I guess these grimy niggas live a long time
Sit in fancy whips, sip champaigne and shine
Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine

[Verse 2]
First it happened to Stretch then to Pac and Big
I'm convinced it can happen to anybody kid
so I get vest up when I get dressed up
in the hood it's messed up, niggas runnin' 'round shootin' shit up
if it's Dom that you drinkin' fill up my cup
if you got somethin' to doubt me, shut the fuck up
why do niggas act like they hard when they know they butt?
and gettin' robbed ain't a good time to press ya luck
duke listen, if you move I'm'a hurt you
you'll get your turn to shine later, patience is a virtue
right now what you need to do is gimme the cash
forget about your Boss bein' mad, just save ya ass
be a good Boy now, go and get your stash
I seen you throw it next to the garbage can like it was trash
alright run along before I shoot ya ass
I hate to do this to you but I really need this cash.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I know we all gotta go, but I'd hate to go fast
then again I don't think it'd be fun to stick around and go last
man listen, if you really really like this shit
nigga call Steve Stoute and I'll write ya shit
call him now before I drop for real 'cause after I drop
I'm'a be chargin' ya'll niggas like Forty a pop
to each his own, me? I got it while it was cheap
typical mentality, I know, I'm straight from the street
1999's the year of the predator, I'm killin' to eat
niggas'll treat you like a egg, you come to cop you get beat
gimme your dough, oh, you wore your jewels? what a treat
you're a generous guy
take 'em off or die
man, we hurtin' 'round here, ain't nobody slingin' pies
look around, ain't nobody 'round here fly
why you 'round here with this shit anyway? huh? you high?
see, you done made the wrong move, kiss your ass goodbye.  

[Chorus]

Aight, check this shit out
Y'all niggaz gon' stay in the car
I'm'a go right over here and see somethin
Gimme ten minutes, If I don't come out, y'all come in
The money stays in the car 'til I say so...
Aiyyo, whattup whattup, man
This is what y'all niggaz is workin' wit' for 22 cents a gram? 

Man, when I come up in here treat me like I'm fam
I could go Uptown and get this shit for 16 cents a gram
Bottom line is, man, I gotta cop and go
I got a spot and I can't afford to stop the flow
Poppi, what the fuck is the matter wit' ya Man?
Standin' against the wall with a gun in his hand
I ain't on no funny shit I'm on some get this money shit
Every four days in PA I move another brick
According to the DA I sold dope in VA
my crew stay in Queens but my plates say VA
I'll show you where I rest at, it aint hard to find me
Let me buy a brick and get the other on cossimy
(Hey, this life is hard man) I know, don't remind me
If I catch another case I'ma kill Guiliani 
It ain't even safe to sell a pack at night
Got task ridin 'round the projects on Mountain Bikes

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
NY ain't the same, it's OT playa
you can go and cop coke from the corner Bodega
hit the highway and take it to a town near you
And get that money man, get that money man

[50 - singing]
Now, if you come to 1-3-4 and I'm not around
That means I copped and I went outta town
You motherfuckers know how I get down
About my money man, about my money man

Nobody likes me
Nobody likes me, but that's okay
Cause I don't like y'all anyway
... And I don't like y'all anyway
Fuck all y'all!!
My watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me
BLAT! Whattup homie
For bitches who don't know me
... They wanna blow me
Cause the shit I floss wit sayin a lot for me

[Verse One]
I came into rap humble, I don't give a fuck now
Serve anybody like niggaz who hustle uptown
Coke price go up, cats is come down
The D's run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found
The bitch who hustle for me, they dont even stash tracks
They keep it on 'em, right there in they ass crack
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrap your fuckin head like a Hindu
Look, I ain't goin nowhere, so get used to me
OG's look at me and see what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot Dice when he broke to So So
The thug, they pop shit, the thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to whole bricks
Nigga ain't in his right mind, goin against me
My picture's painted through words that make a blind man see

[Hook]
Scream murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder! (Fuck around and leave you!)
Murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder, murder! (Your life's on the line!)

[Verse Two]
Y'all niggaz don't want no parts of me
I'm tryna figure out how y'all started me
Make me catch her on the late night
Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off wit the six
I'm not a marksmen while spark issue, I spray random
Not a pretty nigga but my moms think I'm handsome
I hate to hear "He say, She say" shit
Unless he say she say she on my dick
It's no coincidence, niggaz who fuck wit me get shot up
I do a Cali style drive by and tear ya block up
You soft through, be puttin up a crazy front
I stay wit the Mac, cause niggaz tried to blaze me once
In the hood they be like, "Damn, 50 really spitted on 'em"
"You heard that shit?" "Yeah, 50 really shitted on 'em"
Beef, you don't want none, so don't start none
You just a small player in this game, play a part son

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
These cats always escape reality when they rhyme
That's why they write about bricks and only dealt wit dimes
Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car
Nascar, truck wit a crash bar, and TV's in the dash, pa
See 'em in the five wit stock rims, I just laugh, pa
I catch stunts when I ain't tryin 
I ain't lyin, I sit Dom P til I split up
Keep my rent split up
Get outta line, I get you hit up [Wooo!]
Now if you say my name in your rhyme, watch what you say
You get carried away, you can get shot and carried away
Now here's a list of MC's that can kill you in eight bars:
50, umm Jay-Z and Nas
I'ma say this shit now and never again
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
The games you playin, you get killed like that
Actin like you all hard, you ain't built like that
See me when you see me nigga, one (one)

[Hook]

Y'all niggaz don't want no parts of me
I'm tryna figure out how y'all started me
You gon make me catch her on the late night
Pop shots wit the fifth and slide off wit the six

How you gonna take this? like a Man or a bitch?
you gon' get it on nigga or you gon' snitch?
I represent niggas in the hood gettin' rich
man, I stack chips and I unload clips
after 3 Summers in the joint I thought life was hard
some niggas started fightin', some niggas found God
you know me, started sellin' leek in the yard
yo, I ran into niggas who used to have Hummers
big as Hell in the joint wearin' '86 numbers
damm Dog, you been in here that long?
you could think that, but say that and yo' ass is dead wrong
a convo is only three words, "yo whattup"
you ain't gotta work out to leave this bitch cut up
let a nigga find out you on some goin' home shit
and you tryin' to bounce without payin' a loan, shit
some niggas beat cases on the strength of they cream
after the witnesses disappeared on the strength of they team
I'm hard as Hell to get along wit' so it never fails
a nigga I got beef with end up in the same jail
he had a L rolled in bible paper blowin' the lye
I sent him a little kite just to be blowin' his high
and when I shot you in NewYork why would I box you now?
If I catch you in the yard I'm'a ox you down
niggas you think is real really can't hold they own
I'll have 'em on some E.T. shit tryin' to phone home
in here a gemstar is like a Nine Milly chrome
it's similar, infact they'll both split ya dome
scars are souvenirs, niggas always take 'em home. 

Chorus -
You got blown over the jack? (that ain't gangsta)
Your Man ran when you got clapped? (that ain't gangsta)
rockin' a vest with no gat? (that ain't gangsta)
you only a thug when you rap? (that ain't gangsta)
niggas jooked you for your track? (that ain't gangsta)
you ran to other thugs to get it back? (that ain't gangsta)
niggas ran off with your packs? (that ain't gangsta)
If you ain't bustin' ya gat (that ain't gangsta)

Verse 2:
You'd call me an Animal if you seen me livin' on lock
I stay in a box cats be shook when I'm visitin' pop-ulation
when I walk by, niggas like "Fifty don't play Son"
"yeah, somethin' really wrong with that nigga..."
max out, I'm goin' straight for the glock
bust a u-turn, I'm goin' straight to the block
the things that'll happen if niggas say I can't eat
down goes the window....out goes the heat
I'll make the whole block look like a fuckin' trackmeet
some get it in the leg, some get it in the back
some get it in the foot, bleed all over their airmax
nigga pump my packs or pay poor tax
it's extortion, it happens in the hood often
claim more lives than choices, free abortions
Rich Nice says I got a problem with the dice
'cause I put the title to the Benz on the line twice
I rock shit 'cause I stay on that block shit
that 9mm Ruger to your knot shit
see the difference is I'm real and you not, kid
I still stash crack money in my sock, shit
ya'll niggas wanna pop shit? I pop clips
leave with your blood on my mink in the drop Six
Guiliani and Pataki can't stop this
since '86 my whole clique pop Criss.

A pimp aint a pimp with no hoes (hoes)
A hustla aint a hustla with no motherfuckin dough (dough)
A thug aint a thug if his gun dont smoke (smoke)
A playa aint a playa if his ass dead broke (broke)

A thug aint a thug if his gun dont smoke (smoke)
A playa aint a playa if his ass dead broke (broke)

A hustla aint a hustla with no motherfuckin dough (dough)
A thug aint a thug if his gun dont smoke (smoke)
A playa aint a playa if his ass dead broke (broke)

(Repeat)

(50 Cent)
Is your bitch your bitch or is your bitch mines?
Is your bitch your bitch all the time?
You done got your paper, now its time I get mines
Except the serve and everything'll be fine
Bitch!

(50 Cent talking over beat)
Runnin from pimpin...bitch you need to run TO some pimpin
Wit them cheap ass payless shoes you got on hoe
You still aint figured out what a hoe supposed to look like
Look at you motherfucka here
Huh bitch?
How you gunna catch some dates lookin like that hoe?
Bitch get off the sidewalk and into the street
Bitch the sidewalk is for pimpin bitch!

(Fades)

(talking)
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty south?
One time

(Chorus)
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again, just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again, and again

Yo, when you hear talk of the southside, you hear talk of the team
See niggas feared Prince and respected Preme
For all you slow muthafuckas I'm a break it down iller
See Preme was a business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh
This here get ya seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
The roll with Easy Rider and they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects workin for fifty on five-hundred
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize cat
Heart me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pat
How he go out like that?
Rumors in the hood was ?? was snitchin
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSX-R
Had the four-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood draggin jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised
Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
Like L-A-N-Y's, L got shot in the neck, then told us connect
Them niggas who shot 'em got 'em for ten bricks
Fuckin Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks

(Chorus)

That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Quran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Remmy and Joe
And Prince and Rightous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles through the hood, I started learnin
Life's a bitch, with a pretty face, but she burnin
Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through wips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tata
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facin
Go against crews like B-Bo and killers like Patty Mason
A lotta niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that hail at old complexes like Cooley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had loved and sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louie Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizin, but son I'm dead serious
Montanna was no dummy, brought Benice to watch the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
FEDs couldn't catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion

(Chorus)

Yo, rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about yo
The twins was some queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy, Jamaican Pauly, Ducky Cally
Rodney Bump and Chick, shit
A lot a niggas flow the way I flow
but ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writin rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Comin up I heard sippin to much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see playas in this game that lose
I'm forgettin Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
And a conversation over shrimp and lobster
And Benny Hiners heard Chico stopped boxin, and started robbin diners
Shout out to Clanvis and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
If the flow don't kill you the Mac will

(Chorus)

[Talking]
Uh huh, Uh huh, five, five, one...., it's real shit nigga

[Chorus]
You niggaz say somethin' slick, you'll get SLAPPED for that
You niggaz schemin' on some jewels, you'll get CLAPPED for that
If y'all niggaz want war, I got the MACK for that
Run up with some work, and get your head TRACKED for that

[Verse 1]
Nigga if a nickel bag sold in the park, I want in on it (uh huh)
The bullshit I'm in right now nigga, I've been on it (yeah)
If I don't eat, nobody eat, code of the street
No surrender, no retreat, my niggaz rollin' with heat (woo)
You'll know my stees, I spark trees, under palm trees
Feel a breeze, and fees, in expanded keys (uh)
Cop it straight from the bay, tap dance on the yay
Your people make a G day, you ain't rich, you just ok
I take the stand under oath and lie
Before I snitch on my clique, I'll fry
Or watch time go by
Niggaz want to steal slabs, and dib or dab 
In the posse, who steals from the hands that feed 'em, deserve to die

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 2]
You gettin' money nigga (yeah), you dimed out (yeah)
Well 50 Cent is the hottest shit out this (yeah)
You bust your gun nigga (yeah), you on the run nigga (yeah)
You treat a grown man, like he ya son (nigga)
Yo, I ain't the first parolee, to catch his nigga for his rolee
And after being on the street, less than a week (uh huh)
Look, niggaz who know me, know I'm up to no good
Man my fan base is spreading like HIV in the hood
Why smack a nigga silly, when I can squeeze the nilly (squeeze that shit)
A slug'll split a niggaz ass, worst than the philly
I stay with the heater, cut the D with Bonita
My wifey kept acting up, so I had to leave her (woo)
It hurted when I left, but I knew I didn't need her
If it wasn't for my seed, I wouldn't even hafta see her
She tried to front like she don't need me, she miss me, believe me
It's that soap opera shit, the bitch watch too much TV

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 3]
Aight you niggaz tryin' to do too much (STOP FRONTIN')
Them little bit of chips you got son, (AIN'T NOTHIN')
I seen you with your whip outside son (YOU STUNTIN')
You spent your last on that (YOU AIN'T HOLDIN' NOTHIN')
Rap niggaz, they actin' like they ready to flip
When I let off a clip, it ain't a part of the script
Its like tradition, rap niggaz, dyin' they whips (dyin' they whips)
So I spent a little chips, to bulletproof my shit (bulletproof my shit)
You a 6 coupe nigga, but you years behind (years behind)
Nigga yours a 92, mine's a 99 (mine's a 99)
Your not in my league, the ghetto taught me tools to succeed
Shall up a seed, I'll write it down so you can read
If you've been listening, I know you like loving what I said
If not you dumb fuck, I just run over your head

[Chorus] - 2X

[*Singing throughout the entire song, and by itself until fade*]

(Chorus - 50 Cent)
It ain't easy to make money (Whoo)
So now everybody wanna take money (Uh huh, uh huh)
You ain't a thug, matter fact you a fake money (Take money, uh)
Fuck wit mines, I'ma view you at ya weight money
It ain't a game

(Verse 1 - 50 Cent)
You can call me player yeah, but I ain't playing fair (Uh huh)
Takers say I'm the hottest thang comin' this year (No doubt, ha ha ha)
In the hood niggas know, how I handle my problems
I walk up close, and I fo', fo' revolve 'em
Don't make me run to you, put the gun to you
Have yo ass on Phil Donahue explaining what the fuck I done to you
Thug niggas in the street saying I'm sunning you
Dude I'll smoke you every motherfucker under you
People say chill, but still I do, what I wanna do
For now on, when I speak, y'all niggas better listen
Why run against a thoroughbred when you ain't in no condition
Still got shit on ya nose, from all that ass you been kissing (hahaha)

(Chorus x2 - 50 Cent w/ Noreaga in background)
It ain't easy to make money
So now everybody wanna take money
You ain't a thug, matter fact you a fake money
Fuck wit mines, I'ma view you at ya weight money
It ain't a game
It ain't easy to make money
So now everybody wanna take money
You ain't a thug, matter fact you a fake money
Fuck wit mines, I'ma view you at ya weight money

(Verse 2 - Noreaga)
Yo where my down South niggas at, I'm playing piddy-pat
Wit this kitty cat, bitch swear she a city rat
It's Nore now, here look read the story now
My name Nore, and niggas know how I rip
And if I don't feel a nigga, I don't get on his shit
Y'all can love me, or hate me, or suck my dick
I like my hoes just like Summer, no class
And niggas working so hard, and getting no ass
Why y'all niggas acting like, it's all ill in y'all square
Motherfucker you ain't know that it's a hood everywhere
Me and 50 vandal, no we always run scandal
Weak niggas, have us lighting up candles
Sending out roses, condolences, notices
Focuses on, niggas like Fu Quan
Yo in they ground, niggas that don't get no bound
Y'all keep my word, don't love no bird
Get a beef from TM, and just twist my herb

(Chorus - 50 Cent)
So now everybody wanna take money
You ain't a thug, matter fact you a fake money
Fuck wit mines, I'ma view you at ya weight money
It ain't a game
It ain't easy to make money
So now everybody wanna take money
You ain't a thug, matter fact you a fake money
Fuck wit mines, I'ma view you at ya weight money
It ain't a game

(Verse 3 - 50 Cent)
Yo it's all about the cash you getting
Bricks you flipping, the whips you sitting
The bitches you hitting, when you living the thug life
Bitches I don't love no of 'em, the guns I'm running 'em
Punk niggas I'm sunning 'em, every chance I get
Man I know niggas is a trip, so I save all my grip
For these babies faggots flippin', dial 1-800-TIPS
Force me to bury the bricks, and the whips and take trips
Every word that come out of my mouth, I mean it, you could eat
'Cause when I stick you, you gon' cough it up like you bulimic
I'm no magician, but I could make, somethin' outta nothin'
Like turn an empty block, into a crack spot that's pumping
So all you niggas out there, thinking you the nicest
Me 50, I'm ya motherfucking mid-life crisis

(50 Cent talking)
Southside, alright baby, 50 Cent, Noreaga, Trackmasters, teflon

(Chorus - 50 Cent)
It ain't easy to make money
So now everybody wanna take money
You ain't a thug, matter fact you a fake money
Fuck wit mines, I'ma view you at ya weight money
It ain't a game
It ain't easy to make money
So now everybody wanna take money
You ain't a thug, matter fact you a fake money
Fuck wit mines, I'ma view you at ya weight money
It ain't a game

(50 Cent talking)
Know what I'm saying

If a bitch don't like me
Somethin' wrong with the bitch (fuck that bitch)
Why... oh why... why... you wanna fuck with me now?
Yo Dave, that shit come with the game baby, the money, you know
thats how the shit work, you know what I'm sayin'
they supposed to love me now baby
I'm doin' it now baby
hahahaha

[Chorus]
Girl, what makes you wanna fuck with me now?
I've been wantin' to fuck wit' you for quite a while
Is the money makin' you wanna fuck with me?
The money gonna make you sell your soul

[Verse One]
Whoa... if money's gonna make me slam these hoes... then alright
Whattup Shorty, I ain't seen you in many moons
talk to me, how's life been treatin' you? good I hope
you got a smile that only a fool would forget
and a figure that'll leave a nigga droolin' and shit
There I was, kickin' my game, pickin' her brain
buggin' 'cause a while back I met this bitch on the train
she wasn't feelin' me, I pulled up, she wouldn't talk from the whip
Uptown girl, she feel like thats some chickenhead shit
but on the sidewalk we ain't play games
we exchanged numbers and names
I went back to the Range
I heard her Girlfriend whisperin' "I know that nigga, he rich"
she think I got six whips 'cause me and my Man switch
anyway, her name is CeCe
she said she go to BMCC
push a '98 328 with chrome BB's
she said she seen me in the Onyx video on TV
she liked my part the best, man, this bitch is tryin' to G me.

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
It's hard as Hell to find a Girl thats really down for ya
type that'll hold down the Tre pound for ya
they into diamonds now, to Hell with pearls
these trick niggas fucked up, they done gave 'em the World
Hey Shorty, why you like me? huh? you like the way I spit?
oh, I hit your girlfriend, she told you 'bout the dick?
nah for real, am I the type that you wanna roll wit'?
platinum iced out, got rid of that gold shit
I love my lifestyle, you too, you love it
that I could blow Twenty Thousand and think nothin' of it
know you wouldn't fuck with me if I had no ends
probably wouldn't fuck in the whip if it wasn't a Benz
I guess life looks different through them Shanel tints
Man, I don't care if these hoes love me or not
long as I rhyme hot I'm gettin' head in my drop
it goes on and on and on and it don't stop.

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
One thing you can always count on is change
and a rich nigga to come put shit in the game
had a 4.0 then Jigga made you trade your Range
would've felt broke if you couldn't get your change
now it's hard to find us or stay behind us
while we on the 900 double R Hondas
watch the cats who flip bricks recline in the latest whips
while Penetentiaries stay packed with cats who sling packs
all these hoes ain't Madonna fans but all across the World
you can find a material Girl
I sip Dom 'till I earl
take 'em two at a time
quick I get in they mind
have 'em thinkin' they mine
bust off then tell 'em "Bust a Uey, on mo' time"
I'm like the reason ya'll niggas can't eat this year
got your bitch breakin' her neck to peep this here
c'mon... uh huh... c'mon

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

Fuck you bitch! leave me alone, walk on... get the fuck on...
Yo, Shorty... tell your friends ya'll ain't fuckin' with us...
aww man... look... he ain't mean that shit...
c'mon thats just records... niggas is playin'...
we wasn't serious and shit...

[50 Cent]
What y'all know about this fab shit, huh?
TE baby come on, uh-huh Trackmasters uh-huh

Look we can shop together mama, his and hers
Fifth Av. shit baby, Fendi furs
I ain't tight with the chips girl
I'm down to splurge
If it's ice you like I'll light up your life (Ooh)
VS2 Clarity alright
I play the block I ain't the type to punch your clock
I'm the type to put the metal to the floor in the drop
I live life in the fast lane
I make a grove of hash
Hustle hard for cash so I can spoil that ass
It's like she loves me, she loves me not
Cause her friends pump her head hull of bullshit alot
I gave jewels I imported for her
Chanel bags I bought from boosters
To the hood I introduced her
She feisty and sometimes she wanna fight me
People saying if I get knocked she ain't gon write me
The sick part is all that bullshit excites me

1 - [Destiny's Child]
    A thug's what I want
    A thug's what I need
    Even though my friends don't seem to see
    That he lace me with money
    He knows when I want it
    And I'm never gonna leave my baby
    My thugged out no good baby

[50 Cent]
Ay yo I treat you like you need to be treated like you're special
Tie your hands to the bedpost when I caress you
When I met you it was Guess and Gap
Now it's Gucci and Prada
Took you from being a nine to being a dime
You complain that we don't spend time
When I'm OT on the grind going hard for mine
Yo when shorty say she hate me
You know she mean she love me
When she play me close at the bar
That mean she want some Bubbly
See my polying with another chick and shit get ugly
She wanna flip threaten to run keys across my whip
Try to burn a nigga with some Hominy Briss
That's how she on it
When I met her she was lowkey
Now she wanna OD
You know me I let her do her thing son
I say what I'm feeling
Niggas say that I'm illing
I sip Cristy so I'm pissy
Like a staircase in your building
What?

Repeat 1 (2x)

Repeat 1 & 2 till end

2 ? [Beyonce']
    A thug is what I want
    And a thug is what I need
    And my friends don't understand
    How my baby laces me
    A thug is what I want
    And a thug is what I need
    And my friends don't understand
    And I think its jealousy

Trackmasters, 99 shit
Huh uh, huh uh, yea

[Chorus]
Slow dough, is better than no dough (fa sho)
Get caught talking to popo (what you say to him son?) 
They hit you with the fofo (blaow, that's right) 
My niggas is loco (loco)
Yo to diss me that's a no-no (no-no)
Y'all niggas is so-so (so-so)
That's why you ain't got no dough (broke ass niggas)

Put me through any test I bet ya I'll pass cause I'm a cheater
Broke niggas, smoke niggas, rich niggas smoke Cohiba's
My team been puffing chiba and packing heaters since the days of shell toe Adidas
And ain't shit come between us
Look I'm winning now and I'ma keep on winning
I see with you ain't nothing changed same ginen same linen
Fuck the don shit, nigga I'm an armed convict
I live wild beat cases before a trial
Grand jury style I'm foul 
You wondering why I don't smile
I'm schemeing to stick you up now 
Son I be the first to blast the gun, the last to run 
While you hit the pavement son I mash you, ugh
If you don't know you better go and ask someone
50 Cent is my symbol and my name
Symbolizing the change that I'm bringing to this game
Things'll never be the same (never the same baby) 

[Chorus]

Yo nowadays niggas talk like they wanna get shot
Like I won't grab the glock and run up in your spot
Six double O drop I'll put two in your knot 
And stick around and get every motherfucking thing you've got
Here I stand on the alley on godrule 
Same spot where rob got shot
The block's high 
Warrent squad flashing my mug shot
Everybody know I'm loco, kill the popo, blast the fo fo, rode dolo
Rock solo, I should be old T on the low yo
Pump the six and push the volvo
I hear they go kuku and go puff loco 
I sell llelo and price up and down like yo yo
But keep that on the low do, nobody's supposed to know, yo
I make 16 hundred off of every ho do
Fucking with the cash flow that'll get you blast yo (haha) 
I always get the last laugh yo

[Chorus]

I rap a muthafucking house around my my wrist for wreck 
While you niggas race neck to neck 
While niggas who live from cheque to tech
I ain't even going to front I ain't working with a full deck
Life in the hood so hard I done lost some of my cards
Instead of praying before I sleep I put my hands on my heat 
As soon as I start dreaming I'm right back on the street 
Any nigga in this game flowing they think they can see me
Gotta be, fucked up in the head and smoking hemee 
Believe me if you thought like me you could be me
But you ain't been through what I been through and this shit ain't that easy (one)

[Chorus]

(Phone ringing)
(Fifty)
Aww man...who the fuck is callin'?..

[50 Cent]
Look If you ain't worth a mil, you ain't far from broke
Got anought heart to sell weed but you scared of dope
I wouldn't snitch on my peoples if the feds grabbed me
Yo ass would hit more notes than Ron Isley
I wouldn't rhyme about Rolleys if I had no watch
Wouldnt write about crack if I ain't had no spot
You talk six coupe shit you only pushing a trey
Got bitches shutting you down in the C.L.K
For cats like you, crime don't pay
You just linger in the hood, them niggaz blow you away
You the type to get paper when I'm locked up, get yo jewels rocked up
Then have to tuck em in when I pop up
Niggaz in the hood sayin "50's Grimy"
Cause they hit me wit Kosami and now they can't find me
If you see it how I see it, my watch is yo whip
And I can cop anotha one afta each assist

[Chorus] x 2

[50 Cent]
You owe a nigga? You don't wanna pay him?
Kill him, that's what they said ta ta disapper him

She ain't hot but eevrytime I fuck the coke right drops
When it's time to get it on (what)
I pull over the thong (uh huh)
Fuck till I nut then get up, I'm gone (yeah)
Usualy hit it watchin tele way out in L.A.
I like it when she say "Papi I feel it in my Belly"
Call up all my niggaz in New York on the celly
First thing I'm sayin is "Nigga what da deally"
Pack a trey pound up under my Pelle Pelle
Y'all niggaz want war, clap clap, Oh really?
I watch niggaz slang packs in front of the deli
Got 20 inch chrome sittin on my perili
Lorenzo on the Benzo nigga you feel me?

[Chorus] x 2

Gettin fed thru his arm in a hospital wil slim him up
Get it thru yo head, 50 Cent don't care

Ya'll niggas wanna get high, well we gonna get high then
This shit right here is drugs, ya'll for sell baby
50 Cent uh, take it how you wanna take it nigga

[Verse 1]
Yo aiyyo, aiyyo, there is six different wings in the spot, choose one
Some get addicted, some do it for fun
Boy my hoes are clean, just like my guns
And I keep them in a safe place, just like my funds
I keep all my big bills, give my wifey the ones
Frontin' and I'll clap your ass and leave you for dead son
Niggas who know me, know how I get down, I'm fresh out the pound
NYPD crit the flip, get on some New York undercover shit
Fuck wit dogs you ain't familiar wit, and get bit
Niggas scripted through the hit, for some paper and shit
It's all about the cash, keep it in a stash
Some niggas talk shit wit they ass, I see through them like glass
Popo lookin' for me, for some shit I did in the past
If you don't like me at first, I'm gonna grow on you like a rash
This rap shit, I got it in smash, I'm built to last
Feel the wrath, I bust that ass, sit back and laugh (haha)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You don't have to respect a nigga, but respect his cash
Cause for the money, niggas will murder that ass
I came up fast, I watched a lot of gats blast
The power of the dollar (the cash, the cash)

[Verse 2]
Nigga don't you ever forget, I call the shots
I run the spots, extort your pops, flossin' drops
I'm "Livin Off Xperience" like Lox, I'm hot
Check what I got, shorty got knocked
Comin' up out the capsule spot
On the uptown block, he couldn't run from the cops
So my man got shot 
In a jet black Brasada, across the street from his mom's crib on his block
I told him get them niggas that cash, they murdered that ass
Niggas told 'em slow down, he was movin' too fast
Heard the shot, went through his face after the glass, he crashed
Hit the three on his niggas grass, the cattle said it got low fast
The kid who had it done was a crude fella
Who woulda thought he wile out over that mozzarella
We ain't know them, but now we know better
Not to fuck with his cheddar, his man pack a beretta
He won't hesitate to squeeze that, over that green back
Believe that, now niggas know that he's back

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I ain't got a worry in the world, if it's beef, don't sing it, bring it
Parents warn their kids, about people like me
I'm out of order, I turn your only daughter, into a transporter
Before I die, I'm gonna see more blow than Rich Porter (woo)
50 Cent, don't get it fucked up for greens, I for greens
Let it go back to Smith, I dissect it
I check and correct it, flow perfected
I make shit hectic, I wreck shit, nigga check it
If you ain't tryin' to feel the flames from the blast
Respect a nigga cash
My smile will rock niggas to sleep, pack heat
Fuck the police, handle beef on the street
On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm a 9 with 2 MM's
If your man want to get involved, I'll bring it to him
Niggas been wantin' me dead, I'm still here kid
They send their dogs to come get me
They wet shit, but they ain't hit me
Word in the hood is 50, shifty
Niggas they don't want to go against me
Cause they know I hunt your ass alive

[Chorus]

[Madd Rapper]
The art of getting robbed
This is how we do Brooklyn style boy you know what I'm sayin?

[50 Cent]
R.I.P B.I.G, R.I.P P-A-C, R.I.P niggas that wanna OD
Aiyyo the bottom line is I'ma crook with a deal
If my record don't sell I'ma rob and steal
You better recognize nigga I'm straight from the street
These industry niggaz startin to look like somethin to eat
I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, "You wanna see her again?"
Get your ass down to the nearest ATM
I have dreams of fuckin an R&B bitch
And I'll wake up early and bounce with all your shit
When I apply pressure,son it aint even funny
I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
Brian McKnight, I can get that nigga anytime
Have Keith sweatin starin down the barrel from my nine
Since these Harlem World niggaz seem to all be fam
I put the gun to Cardan tell him, "Tell your man
Mason Betha, haha, come up of that watch now
I mean right now"
The only excuse for being broke is bein in jail
An entertainer can't make bail if he broke as hell
I'd rob ODB but that'd be a waste of time
Probably have to clap him run and toss the nine
I'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks
Plottin to juice her for that rock Kurupt copped
What Jigga just sold like 4 mil? He got somethin to live for
Don't want no nigga puttin four thru that Bentley Coupe door
I'll man handle Mariah like "Bitch get on the ground"
You ain't with Tommy no more who gonna protect you now?
I been skeamin on Tone and Poke since they found me
Steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me
I'm a klepto nah for real son I'm sick
I'm bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school shit
Right now I'm bent and when I get like this I don't think
About to make Stevie J take off that tight ass mink
I'll rob Pun without a gun snatch his piece then run
This nigga weigh 400 pounds, how he gon catch me son?

[Madd Rapper](Chorus) 2x
This aint serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent how it feel to rob and industry nigga?

[50 Cents]
Ill catch P and Silk The Shocker right after the Grammies
And Will Smith and Jada ass down in Miami
Run up on Timberland and Missy w/the pound
Like you gimme the cash and u put the hot dog down
I figured it out 
Been robbin Joe before that's why his ass 
don't wanna be a playa no more
Mad at you I'm robbin J.D., FUCK YOU!! PAY ME!!
Had Da Brat with em, shoulda had his gat with him
DMX wanna get down well you tell homey
I'm on that Treach shit, I do my +Dirt All By My Lonely+
I should rob Clue man his shit did well
I wanna stick TQ but his shit ain't sell
I hit the studios take shit and leave
Catch Rae Ghost and RZA for them funny ass rings
Tell Sticky gimme the cash before I empty three
Ill beat your ass like that white boy on MTV
Cannibus wanna battle while I'm stickin them up
Nigga get capped coroners pickin em up
Heavy tried to hide his shit, nigga try to stall ya
He said "Why you robbin me I got _Nuttin But Love_ for ya!"
Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
Told him I want it all he said, "Even my gold teeth?"
I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black jeep
One at a time get out and take off your shine
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that I'd flash the nine?
And walk off with your shit like it's mine?
I'ma keep stickin niggas until I'm livid
I'll rob Boys II Men like I'm Michael Bivins
Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robyn Givens
I'm hungry for real im bout to stick Mister C
That nigga still eatin off Big's first LP
I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor
He asked me if I had enuff I told him "Gimme Some More"
Is you feelin this?  Then wait for the sequel
I gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbin Gods People

[Madd Rapper] 
(chorus)
For real yo you know what I'm sayin?
Niggas got to get stuck up that's just how it goes down
It don't matter if you an industry nigga or a regular nigga
It don't matter, if you got it and I need it I want it
50 Cents ain't fuckin around
Track Masters ain't fuckin around
Crazy Cat ain't fuckin around
The Madd Rapper aint fuckin around
So watch your backs, watch your pocket book, watch your pockets
Watch everybody on the train, watch everybody on the bus
Cause we gonna get you whether you like it or not

Rule number one don't go against the grain
Rule number two give respect where respect due
Rule number three if you get knocked play games and say names
(gun click sound) the 45 will tear you out the frame
Its like the rich get richer and the poor don't get fuckin thing
Don't mean nothin changed but the things my money bring
My style will leave you aggy like them cats in jail
You peoples got pleany money actin like they ain't got bail
I feel for you niggas gettin shot while I'm sayin this rhyme
Or niggas in the mess hall gettin shot on shallow lines
An old timer schooled me don't burn bridges my friend
Imagine the G-Dub close and yo ass gotta swim
I watch the fifth melt a nigga melt a nigga of the sidewalk of New York
Me and shorty saw from afar and had a talk
He said I told em if he came around I'd clap him, I gave him my word
Look at his head its still shakin he had alot of nerve

(chorus)
(Jadakiss sample: If it wasn't for the flow
 I'd probably have to double Back bubble crack)
(Jay-Z sample: yea yea I'm a hustler)
3x
(chorus)

Yo when the fed come in the game loyalty is limited
Hardcore niggas start actin feminine
With the feds you do eighty five percent of your time
Duke you get ten you'll damn near do nine
Hate a liar more than I hate thief
A thief is only after my salary a liar is after my reality
The streets I know'em like my ABC's
Stay away from the D's and stack ya cheese
Try to see three hundred g's fore you see three hundred C's
Tree top to feel the breeze co connect for key's
Yo bitches sexin me take me to ecstacy
Once I nut (ahh oh shit) I don't want 'em next to me
If its on mother fucker believe I'm gonna ride
I'm the type to swallow my blood fore I swallow my pride
Letters on my shirt read DKNY
Got grimy niggas runnin with me from BKNY

(Chorus)

They say I don't sound like a killer well how a killer sound
I bet I grab a foe pound and back that ass down
See many men live baby and many men die
Many men get drunk puff lah and stay high
Here's a jewel love you enemies and hate your friends
Your enemies remain the same friends always change
I don't quit that theres more that one way to skin a cat
You can get him in the face dog or down his back
All bullshit aside now its time to be honest
I fear no man for death is all thats promised
I got niggas standin in line waitin to hear me spit
From eighty six to ninety six the game went from sugar to shit
This for you niggas in the background dyin to shine
I hate you like fiends who ask for a dime for nine
Don't nothin change in the game but faces and names
Skate to wait to date and the jake

(chorus)

New York City...
You are now rockin with 50 cent..
Are you ready?
[Gun click]
I said are you ready?
See you wit me nigga?
DROP DEAD.

(mumbles:Paid for a hooptie but I wanted a drop)
"G UNIT"
"Somthin new"
I'm not that nigga in your video
I'm not a trick I don't love the hoes
and Niggaz know, I be on the low
but I miss my dawg
and I twist my drawer
I'm not that nigga that you think you know
I walk around with a big fo-fo
You front on me I'm gone get at your dawg
I be at rite are your crib, right at your door

What up 50?

Coming up I ain't have much, but I wanted alot
I had paper for a hoopty but I wanted a drop
so you know, I had make somthing outta nothin
Like turn an empty spot into a crack spot pumpin
im so hard at nine-teen I bought a benz, I did.
The older niggaz really wasn't feelin the kid
Try to find where I live so they could run in my crib
but you can't hustle a hustler I peeped it and slid
Back then, Niggaz used to call me bo
At six months I told them "Million go tops on Gar-bo"
Country came around, hes into clappin
country left, same shit started happening
Like "He shot rob for some ends, rob shot joe for some skins,
Cory shot drew and we was friends, money turned boys into men
The cycle never changes, shit just starts again..

"naw nigga, ain't nuthin changed nigga,
yea I've been gone for a minute, but I'm BACK!"
(damn 50 it's good to see you back in the hood)
you see my cherry red SL nigga I'm doin good
sometimes I can't find the words to say how I feel
so, I take a quote from menace "LOOK AT THE WHEELS!!"
I'm addicted to stuntin, now that I'm holdin something,
I got a trunk full of guns from VA to ?
     (oh will you let me hold something?)
nigga you high or something? I don't play games I'm
bout my money nigga buy something!
I got a few 5ths, I got a few 9's,
Here nigga take one...

"yea, don't ever say I don't do nothing for you nigga,
you kno don't say I didn't look out for you. KnowhatImean?
But make sure nigga that you go catch some jokes
when you come back you gonna have my paper for that thang thang knowhatI'msayin?
I don't want it back, don't try to use it then give it back to me
Cuz I ya'll niggaz now, runnin around sayin 
"50 getting all this rap money and he won't help us" ha ha...
Sit tight nigga I'm comin! You know?  New shit!!!
All the shit I put out on the mix tapes is for the mix tapes
I got a million... 
... 
OH MY GOD!! My shit is so hot right now I'm in the zone

I'm on parole, I used to be on probaaaaaation
I'm with my gun I get full coporaaaaaation
I tell you "take it off" no hesitaaaaaation
Nigga you play around, I lay you down
That's how it's goin' down
Don't play wit' me, I don't have patieeeeeents
My headachin', and I need my medicaaaaaaation
Niggaz be hatin', they don't know what they faaaaaacin'
Nigga you play around, I lay you down
That's how it's goin' down
I be in court throwin' signs like I'm a maaaaaason
Nigga witness against me, I'ma eraaaaaase 'em
If they try an runaway, I'ma chaaaaaaase 'em
Now with the pound, and I'm a lay 'em down
That's how it's goin' down

[Chorus]
Better watch how you talk
Better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York
That's how we get down
22's on the jeep
Somthin' deep in the seat
When we creep wit the heat
That's how we get down

(50 Cent)
Wise men listen and laugh while fools talk
Stick up kids don't live long in New York
Fuck around and catch the wrong jukes on the street
Get caught slippin', then get hit wit' like three
In every hood in the US, I'm that nigga they feelin'
Rap full of good guys, 50 Cent is the villan
I play the bar with 8 bottles all night gettin' right
Teachin' the hoodrats what Cristal taste like
I put 60 on wrist, 12 on my fist, 100 on my neck
We in the hood nigga schemin', what you expect?
My S on 22's leave ya hos confuuuuuused
On the track ready to choose, like "Daddy we want you"
My love live ain't change, the shorties still hug me
Bullet wound in my face, and bitches still love me
Now Nelly told you how them country boys talk
I came to teach you how we put it down in New York
That's how we get down

[Chorus]
Better watch how you talk
Better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York
That's how we get down
22's on the jeep
Somthin' deep in the seat
When we creep wit the heat
That's how we get down

(50 Cent)
In the city, a young buck'll tell you how the mac spit
O.G. give 'em the word, you gonna get yo' ass hit
I don't know why niggaz like to talk bad about me
I'm the richest nigga they know without a G.E.D.
Man it could be the money, it could be the ice
It could be they'd like to be me and can't live my life
You should here they be sayin' man "50 be flippin'"
"Shot my man over 7 grams, that nigga be trippin'"
I know death is promised, I don't fear gettin' murked
It's when a nigga half-way killa ya homie, it hurts
Now we can hit the club and get it crunked
Or you could start some shit, and I could hit you with
the pump, you can have it how you want
But I know you like my style (Uh-Huh)
Ya like how I break it down, wanna get rich?
I'll show you how, take this pack, pump these pieces
That's how we get down

[Chorus]
Better watch how you talk
Better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York
That's how we get down
22's on the jeep
Somthin' deep in the seat
When we creep wit the heat
That's how we get down

(Lloyd Banks)
Right now my life movin to fast to stop and pray
See every now and then I smile just not today
In my hood they let the choppers spray
Somebody probably got shot today
I named em pop when niggas surfboard
You aint stoppin me dawg
Only time you left ya hood is on Monopoly boards
You grimey as birds shittin on the top of ya fords
You will, die by the gun if you aint droppin ya sword
I got tattoos as well as lead marks
To me fucking is kinda like racin and I always get a head start
My opinion of a sweet dream is a dead NARC
Just yesterday guns is blastin with red darts
Beef, you a target
Cause when we come at yo ass, Aladdin wont be the only one the carpet
Man you wanna play wit a ringer?
I aint a peoples person
I'll give my next door neighbor the finger (fuck you)
Even though I got the shit in the stores
I'm like a nigga that borrow clothes
Bitch, I'm tryin to get in ya draws
Man I'll dump a whole clip in ya mans braids
Pussys love Nelly, he made it look cool to wear bandaids
I'm blowin on damn haze
All of a sudden I'm gased, cause I'm on the radio and I can't wait
If you aint up on thangs
Lloyd Banks is the name, G-Units the game
Now I know to keep low when the heat blow
I'll have niggas post up on ya block like I'm shootin the free throw
Still get the green from P-dro, better known as Pedro
I'm ghetto like a patty ya egg-roll
Yea they feinin to stick me, they don't know the meanings is wit me
Snuck in wit Christina and Brittney
You only spend time at the mall
On New Years eve a body drops around the same time as the ball (yea)

(Chorus- Banks)
G-Unit, G-Unittttttt,G-Unit, G-Unittttttt,G-Unit,G-Unit (repeat)

(50 Cent-between Banks)
G-Unit nigga that's what's up (repeat 6x)
That's what's up

(50 Cent)
Keep thinkin I'm candy
Aint nuttin sweet about me
Nigaas talkin in the pens and in the street about me
Some jake, tryin to watch every move I make
Cause my Deez'll make fiends do the up-town shake
I'm a pro, far from a amateur, holdin more keys than your fuckin janitor
They say "God bless the child that could hold his own"
You pay cops to hold you down, I just hold the chrome
Every breath I take, every step I take, every move I make
I got a ruger on my hip
You aint gotta like or love me but you gone respect me 
You need a fifth and 2 clips to try and check me
12 in the afternoon we can start the clappin
Look homie I'm down for that day-time action
Keep thinkin it's a game time in front of ya home
Get the drop on that ass and shot shadder ya bones (yea)

(Chorus- Banks)
G-Unit, G-Unittttttt,G-Unit, G-Unittttttt,G-Unit,G-Unit (repeat)

(Tony Yayo)
Listen boy, Tony be the real McCoy
When hoes see the new toy, they jump for joy
And even though the kid rappin 
I still got fiens in the hood puffin on that Magic Dragon
My guns under my pillow, I sleep wit my shoes on
Every single night me and my mack get our groove on
Don't get moved on
Cause I shoot through your bicepts your tricepts 
Then breeze through ya projects
When the coke come back
It's the China White
And the d don't sweat us in a bag a rice
Let's ride O T 
And burn the tape
I got this bad mommy, her mouth's a sperm bank
Since Yayo be a fearless man
I donate my heart to them niggas that ran
And, those niggas in the hood don't wanna see me famous
They rather see my moms make funeral arangements
I got enough rhymes, to fill 6 notebooks
I been spittin that shit ever since coke crushed
You can hear me on your T.V. and radio at the same time
I never ever say the same rhyme, it's Tony 2 times
Beware of my wraith, I'm gone school you niggas
Prepare for class
Yo I peep where your puns at, peep where you pumped that
Money you tryin to stack I spent it on blunt wraps

(Banks)
Word to my mother nigga 50 fuckin Cent nigga

NYPD, LAPD, NYPD

[Verse]
Niggaz wanna shine like me (me), rhyme like me (me)
Then walk around with a 9 like me (me) 
They don't wanna do it, 3 to 9 like me
And they ain't strong enough to take 9 like me
Aiyoo, you think about shittin' on 50... save it
My songs belong in the Bible with King David
I teach niggaz sign language, that ain't def son
*click* *click* you heard that? That mean RUN
Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stun on, pa
Pull through, I'll throw a fuckin cocktail at ya' car
From the last shootout, I got a demple on my face
It's nothin', I could go after Mase's fanbase
Shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doctor to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth *huck-too* spit it out
I don't smile a lot, cause ain't nothin' pretty
Got a purple heart for war, and I ain't never left the City
Hos be like "Fitty, you so witty"
On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P.Diddy
You got fat while we starve, it's my turn
I done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn
Won't learn

[Chorus 2X]
If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me
Like me duke, you not like me

[Verse]
Moma said..
Everything that happened to us, was part of God's plan
So at night when I talk him, I got my gun in my hand
Don't think I'm crazy, cause I don't fear man
Cause I feel when I kill a man, God won't understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan
I been coulda killed these niggaz, I'm still waitin
In the telly with to whores, a Benz with to doors
32 carrots in the traws, no flaws
You see me in the hood, I got atleast two guns
I carry the glock, Tony carry my M-1s
Hold me down nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me
D's waitin for my response to lock me
This is my hustle, nigga don't knock me
You need some shit with banana clips to try and stop me
I'M THE ONE

[Chorus 2x]
If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me
Like me duke, you not like me

[Verse]
See, I done been to the Pearly Gates, they sent me back
The good die young, I ain't eligable for that
I shot niggaz, I been shot, sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta, so I stand some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me, you wanna know me
From 3 point range, with a glock, I shoot better then Kobe
See a nigga standin' next to me, he probably my Co-D
See a bitch gettin in my whip, she probably gon' blow me
See the flow is like a 38, it's special yoooooo
A country boy tell ya, I'm fittin' to blowwwww
I'm more like a pimp, then a trick, you knowwww
See, I'm in this for the paper, I don't love the hooos
Niggaz broke in the hood, worried about mines
Grown ass men, wearin starter piece shines
You know them little pieces, with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
When the gossip starts, I'm always the topic
You too old for that shit dog, why don't you stop it
Shorty, I been watchin you watchin me
Now tell me what you like more, my watch or me
Haha

[Chorus 2x]
If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me
Like me duke, you not like me

*Ad-libing to the end*

[repeat 2X]
50 bars of pleasure, 50 bars of pain
When I'm dead and gone niggaz gon' remember my name, 50

[50 Cent]
Yo, Black is flashy like Alpo, gun happy like Papi
Sneaky muh'fucka 'mind me of nigga that clapped me
He ain't the type you shoot dice with and win dawg
Unless you want to get your ass laid out in Gilmore
He had some soldiers, 'mind me Troy and E-Bags
When they came through they hollored like, "Whattup Conrad?"
Grimy niggaz, they loved to get gully
Summertime, still had on black gloves and skullies
The Lex 450 pulled up that's Cornbread
Them niggaz from Philly woulda called him an old head
But he a O.G., 'mind me of Chaz and Bump, real low key
Sounded like they don't know nothin about drama
For this money shit many men do trauma
Switchy walked in son, this bitch had the baddest ass
The bulletproof glass was rolled down on his S-Class
Heard in D.C., he kept mad blocks in order
Picture this, a young nigga gettin it like Rich Porter
Sonny came in for half a pit - he got knocked
He on lock still controllin the spot from Comstock
Pop pulled up in the CL5, surprisin Caine
His man just got fucking merked by some lame
Heard he got it in the Range nigga Caine popped one in his brain
over some-thang, took his watch and his chain
Country boys off the hook down there in Richmond mayne
In the black 740 I sat, my hat turned back
"Down down baby," Nelly singin my wrist blingin what?
I'm waiting on this nigga Wise, three loaves for two pies
Son he smokin that shit, I can see it in his eyes
Comin up Wise, and locs is close
And locs ride 'round lookin for wires to toast
Benny hopped out the Escalade with a few thorough men
From B-More, they sellin heroin in Maryland
Reverts back to Diesel, killed like 4 fiends
His popularity grew, that only meant more cream
First it was him and his brother, now he got a team
Went from 5 and a half grams to livin the dream
Seen he pulled up, God damn, you know his format
Bentley is all marble in the door, mink floor match
Hit the hazards, out the stash box popped 2 glocks
Peace "All Eyez on Me," 2Pac
Everybody know he a boss he still gotta floss
He on the same bullshit that sent Gotti up north
That's Ty in the blue TS, stuntin like he Nicky Barnes
He broke but he talk like he a Don
Homes hoppin out the Jag that's Max, Haitian cat
Kill a nigga quick remind me of Haitian Jack
I peeped his style son I know his steelo, he on the d-low
He smile at niggaz mumblin fuck you in Creole
Heard war stories bout how he maneuver with the Ruger
Hold the iron horizontally and send shots through ya
Few niggaz tried to merk him, most them got found
Some turned away try to run they in wheelchairs now
Banks hopped out, bulletproof this, bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel, bulletproof hat
Got out a black Hummer, he blew 90 on that
Poppin mad shit like he gonna bulletproof that, let's go

[repeat 2X]

Since 'How to Rob' a lot of niggas been naming names
Monkey see monkey do, I done changed the game
Still niggas acting like I don't get down or something
Like I aint the next nigga to wear the crown or something
You gonna talk about your chips till we run in your crib
And you gone ask dumb questions like "Can I Live?"
Look, If I shoot you, I'm famous
If you shoot me your brainless, you said it yourself
I'm slick enough to twist your lines and send them back at you
Swift enough to snatch the mack and pop that at you
Take it personal see if I won't send you to hell
I've done told Ton and Pok? they better have my bail
But if its over a mil don't put the crib up dun
Cause if 50 get free nigga, 50 gonna run

[Chorus]  2x
It's best you be a gentleman
and you watch what you say (bwahh bwahh, nigga take that)
Or Jesus Christ can't save you once you go gangsta, friend
(bo! bo! bo! bo! bo!...It's gangsta)

[50 Cent]
Look I'm supposed to be cocky, I ain't a po' no mo'
I ain't gotta steal from the corna' store no mo'
Got my own crib, I ain't sleepin' on the flo' no mo'
Bouncers don't try to play me at the do' no mo'
But when they see me they say search him
"He might have the nine
He might shoot this motherfucker up like Shyne"
It's been a while since a new nigga came tight like this
Ya man, he aight, but he ain't quite like this
Niggas is feelin' it
The Benz pullin up on the set (uh huh)
Me jumpin out 30 tho on my neck (uh huh uh huh)
And since you said it was nothin' to sweat (what)
That you was outta line so here's what you get
A verbal ass kickin'
Jesus Christ sent me to test ya
Let's see how see how he act's under pressure
Till Makaveli returns it's 'All Eyez On Me'
Till the feds build up cases and find pie's on me

[Chorus]  2x
It's best you be a gentleman
and you watch what you say (bwahh bwahh bwahh, bwahh nigga take that)
Or Jesus Christ can't save you once you go gangsta, friend
(bo! bo! bo!, It's gangsta)

It's gangsta, 2000 shit

(Echoing)
Ya'll know what you need to do, get together,
 make a We Are The World record, faggot ass niggas)

[Chorus: *Scratching*]
Pain In Da Ass "Fuck You" 3x

Styles "I don't give a fuck who you are"
Pain In The Ass " Fuck You"

[Verse]
Either I'm trippin' off the ecstasy
Or I could feel the world turnin'
I'm havin' flashbacks, I can feel the shells burnin'
Comin' up, I was taught never back down
That's why I act the way I act now, hold the mac down
32 shots, squeeze til there ain't a shell left
Come with my gun smokin', you can smell death
They get the first laugh, I get the last laugh homie
Hit the gas on it, pull up and mash on 'em
There's a lot of talk in the streets about me
Niggaz know, ain't nothing sweet about me
Get back to questions, like "50, who shot ya?...
You think it was Preme, Freeze or Tah, Tah?"
Nigga, street shit should stay in the street
So, keep it on the low
But everybody who's somebody already know
A few words for any nigga that get hit the fuck up
My advice if you get shot down, is get the fuck up
LET'S GO

Chorus (Different Variations)

[Verse]
Maaaaaaaaan
I told niggaz not to fuck with me they still push me
Figured they'd get away with it cause Tone and Poke pussy
I been gone through static, shot at with automatics
Since 90, when Nas came out with "Illmatic"
If Suge was home, Death Row would be good for me
Cause Tommy Matola ain't shootin out in the hood wit me
I've been shot 9 times my nigga that's why I walk funny
Hit in the jaw once, why I talk funny
With a Ruger on my hip, I walk the street with no care
Think my grandma's prayers the only reason I'm here
My wrist icy, keep my ears icy, keep my neck icy
That's why you bitch like me, so I'm a heavyweight
How dare these niggaz take me lightly?
I ain't come to make friends and niggaz aint gotta like me
My own homie said "50, you done lost yo' mind"
Cause I shootout in broad day, run and toss my nine

Chorus [Different Variations]

[Verse]
Can't find a nigga in the hood, that say "50 ain't hot"
When I drop, I'm sound like Eminem and Kid Rock
Play the block, with the watch all rocked the fuck up
Jukes me, A week later y'all be shot the fuck up
Born a healthy baby, I wasn't always crazy
This aint how moma rasied me, this how the hood made me
The D's call me by my government name
I be dumb and shoot up parks 
Have niggaz runnin' like "Jesus Comin'"
There's wet pillows in prison, niggaz cry in the dark
Cause if they did in the day, niggaz would question they heart
So when they come home, the come home
Walking that tough walk, talking that "Rockavalede"  
Talk'll get you shot in New York - BBBBLLLLATTTTT  
Sex, money, murder, I gotta eat
But I aint tryin do +Hard Time+ like +Pistol P+
See, niggaz uptown understand me in the street
You niggaz uptown'll "Stan" me in the street
Ha-ha

"Niggas bit off Nas shit"  - Ghostface Killah

(Repeat)

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
You can be a ridah and ride, or a coward and hide
Either way you go against me, you still gon die
I got four macs, a few nines, I'm ready for beef
You wanna talk, it ain't about money, then let it be brief
I need a drop for when it's a hot, a hummer for when it's cold
An ill attorney's in my corner when these fake niggas fold
The shit I kick fuck with niggas mentally, makes them wanna mention me
And see me doing a quarter century in the penitentiary
Nastradamus predicted 50's the future, that's a fact money
I run up on your workers with the mac, like where that pack money
I'm a tell ya'll what Papi told me
I got what you need, 19,5 a key
I stay catching a stunt, frontin' in somethin' mean
And I'll clap any nigga for the right amount of cream
Run up on them all with the same problem solver
Beat up ass, tape on the handle, trey eight revolver. What!

[Chorus]
Projects too hot, niggas better hope we never hit rock
Cause then we gonna run up in your spot
Screamin' get the fuck on the floor, give us the Ro'
(Repeat)

[Verse 2 - Nature]
Aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
I'm like Sugar Shane Mosley, it ain't no beef
You're staring, a ticket holder that sits in row three
Next to Ron Artest and Kobe
Yo I woulda went pro too, then I let them phillies slow me
I'm like a black man's asthma, seeking a pump
Breathin' deeper when I'm creeping up
Ya'll need to fuck with the tightest, I stick niggas
Ensevilitus, leavin' whole families in silence
My virus is obvious, past on to most rap fiends
Un cured, ain't no vaccine
Last seen at the automatic teller machine, maxing out
Or in the studio booth, blacking out
It's Con Ed style, real twisted, I disappear on some Blair Witch shit
Comin' back I'm rich kid
Either or, you can't stop me with my feet in the door
Or walk away from the street or the morgue, play your part nigga.

[Chorus - Last line cut off]

"Niggas bit off Nas" - Ghostface Killah
"Admit it, you bit it" - G. Dep
"Tell these niggas somethin' God" - Ghostface Killah

[Verse 3 - Nas]
What, yo
I disturb niggas and white boys, with five pointed stars
Tatted on they arms, pimp your moms, like I'm Magic Don Juan
From Queens to Hong Kong, weed in the bong
We smoke that, leave our minks on the coat rack
Those that plot on me, nine times outta ten the nine is on me
Feds search the God, but nothin' they find on me
When I rap don't wait to clap applaud sooner
Unless you hate a nigga like George Bush Jr., I bring awkward to you
Porsche maneuvers thru the city like New York sewers
Stinkin' up the air, Central Park, horse manure
Rims is 22 inches, Benz suspensions
22 inch dick when I'm pimpin'
Impotent you niggas get me sick, wanna be soundin' like
You knowin' my arithmetic, but we don't sound alike
50 Cent with Braveheart-ed, we ride to the grave depart us
You fake niggas imitate what I started, let's go

[Intro - Once]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1 - Nas]
Hats off, to da rich ones who flash and floss
Pour some liquors out to my dogs trapped up north
Reminisce on the deceased who no longer exist
Only wishin' we could bring them back with songs like dis
Old flicks on us chillin' wit da old time click
Holdin' nines, thoughts of death, not our lives we risk
How it use to be, early morn, pumpin' in shifts
Jakes wit pale faces in the night is the scariest
They handcuff me, they knew my government and alias
Various calls were made up for awarin' us
The D's in the marked vans and cabs
In our land, hoodrats get stapped by niggas who forty
Turnin' out young lady's and make them make thoughties
Got them coked out, the hood is bugged out
Thug babies, famous in they strollers
Before they walk they knew the hood talk
It's in the air of New York
So everybody'll pick em up, kissin em up
Treatin' them like they own, in dis hood we call home
Fist fight till we grown and these guns come out
Circle of life, it's kinda deep how we end out.

[Chorus]
Yo them niggas that wanted beef before
Don't want no beef no mo
Now that they know who I rep with
QB NIGGA!!!
Who I rep with
QB NIGGA!!! (repeat)

[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
Ya'll niggas better sober up before ya'll speak to me, don't come at me high
Last rapper that raised his voice to me, got japped in da eye
Now if I say I'm gone get you, I'ma get ya
On da strength of da inf, from long range I can hit ya
You find out them niggas who wit ya ain't even wit ya
After da gem stars split ya, you need an MD to stitch ya
Peep how I use words to paint pictures
Peep how I got niggas with bodies askin' me for ten cents to got hit ya
Look my name up in the law book, Curtis Jackson
Known for creatin' action, by rapidly clappin'
Nigga I stay strapped, so much I nickname gats
Got a tech I call Tina, a nine I name Nina
Two niggas went to see Allah afta they seen her
This QB shit, bout to take me to da next level
Next crib, next Benz, next bitch, next bezel.
It's that real.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Bravehearts] (Millennium Thug, Horse, Jungle, Wiz)
Yo, aiyyo, who da fuck wanna war
I got a four four, pierce ya'll niggas jaw
You see me thugged out, iced out, Guinness Stout
Hopin' out the Range wit da gun out
Smack your man down, you ran off
I was gonna hit him with two, I left some for you
I put four, QB rugged and raw
I got somethin' for these rap cats, fish held back gats
Scope wit a beam on it, loc put your cream on it
Shine don't scheme on it, I make your dream about it
Forever, whatever whatever get gully
Shots thru your leather and clothe, With your skelly off
Break ya'll clowns off
Yo hollow tips will flood your jacket, I don't give a fuck who you be
Millennium Thug, now who da fuck want it with me.

I mastered the art of slap boxin' niggas in da dark
QB's big man, Horse of the Bravehearts
I'm da Sasquash of rap, collector of gats
Testin' macks at your bulletproof vests and hats.

How bout that, guns bust off, I bust back
When trucks backfire, I bust back
How bout that, stomp a muhfuckin' rib out ur back
Ya'll niggas ain't gangsta rap, ya'll click like Josey and the Pussycats
When we come around da front, stop.

Uh huh, ya'll can't fuck around ya'll get dropped
When guns pop, who's tellin'
Twin barrel nines wavin' and yellin', QB NIGGA WHAT
Two-time felon, straight to da melon, straight to da dome
Send a nigga back, get da shells, go straight home
Never slip, my +Ill Will+ to survive is so deep
Can't sleep, cousin to death, makes me weak
Pullin' triggers at my shadow, Bravehearts pop up
Wiz, Jungle and Horse shot your block up.

[Chorus 2]
Them niggas that wanted war before
Don't want no war no mo
Now that they know who I rep wit

(50 Cent)
Yo this is 50 cent, yaknawsayin?
I'm here with my man Whoo Kid, you know how I put it down nigga
It's not safe around here as soon as the street lights
G-Unit nigga

{*random shout outs*}

(50 cent and G-Unit)
We can't get Money selling weed...WE GON SELL COKE
Ain't no money sellin' coke... WE GON SELL DOPE
Ain't no money sellin' dope... WE GON SELL X
And if niggaz wont by the X... WE GON SELL TECS

(Lloyd Banks)
My advice for y'all niggaz is stop frontin
'Cause 50 say pop somethin', I'm gon pop somethin', what up?

(50 Cent)
Don't make me send a nigga to you, 16 shot ruger
Send twelve shots to you, run four in the clip
Get in the whip, it's a wrap

(Lloyd Banks)
Nah fuck that

(50 Cent)
Man, you done hit the nigga twice in the head, that's that
Niggaz running with the steel out, now it's time to peel out

(Lloyd Banks)
50 let me drive

(50 Cent)
Nah I got this, nigga chill out

(Lloyd Banks)
It'd be nice to get the niggaz ice, get it, give it back

(50 Cent)
Just get in the corner store cause it's full of them A-rabs
They blowin' the shit up like it's okay
I got a bomb on my waist I'm Kamikaze (*laughing*)
I dare Ds to get next to me

(Lloyd Banks)
Or a nigga to creep up and put a tec to me {*explosion*}
Yeah, yeah that's it, it's a freestyle
The fuck you want for free?
Fucking A-rabs just ran the planes into the fucking building
Coke price went up 10 grand this fucking week

(50 Cent)
Uh, yeah, 50 Cent
It's Murda Mix Tape Vol. 3
Whoo Kid, Stretch Armstrong nigga
Take that, yo, aiyyo
Niggas don't wanna see 50 on a track
I got these cats that rap scared of me like I'm Ace and Jack
Fuck that, if I was you, I be scared of me too
Yo Stretch, roll the weed, while I tell 'em what I need
I need cream by the stacks, shells for the mac
Rims for the 'Ac, and a bitch to blow her back
I need the coke to come back, mad time on a jack
I got the Fendi sweaters, all I need is the hats
I need the police to chill, stay the fuck off my back
See a nigga in a Benz, sway peddling crack
I need a stash box son, so I could stash the gat
I need a stadium light, to leave 'em blind as a bat
Flipping from under my plate, while I'm running from Jake
I'm making mistakes, look I need extra pace
My man up north, need the new Stretch Mix Tape
I'm physically fit, nah for real son I'm in shape
I need that Beyonce bitch, to take me out on a date
Niggas follow my footsteps, 'cause everything I say, slick
But I need y'all niggas, to get off my dick
My description in three words, real witty cat
I'm in the club in ATL, I'm where the titties at
What, what, 50 Cent nigga, 2000 shit, Stretch Arm-Strong
Whoo Kid nigga, Whoo Kid nigga, Whoo Kid nigga
What, Whoo Kid nigga, this how it's going down (*echoes*)

Aiyo, I know these niggas don't like me
But I don't like none of ya'll niggas, you know what I'm sayin
50 cent, 9-9, motherfuckin doo wop
Volume 3, take it however the fuck you wan' take it
Faggot ass niggas (50 Cent show these niggas how to rock)

Yo, they done shot that boy down like a dog in the street
Left him smelly, man fuck that, roll em over take that fellas pellet
You ain't never heard a motherfucker spit like this
Not even puff, and that nigga there made crazy hits
Every few years a nigga come who crazy hot
I'm the next best thing since Biggie and Pac
Now I'm sayin this shit slow, so you don't miss it
Don't be a statistic, my jewels from the district
Stay with my biscuit, touch mines and get twisted
Son I'm off the meter, my mind locked on crime
See I'm tired of all these rappin niggas dyin to shine
And I'm tired of fiends askin for a dime for nine
Hearing this next punch line from me, may sound strange
You sit your 5-dollar ass down, before I make change
Yo the sale went stale, caught em real bad
Fresh out the jail, shit is really real
Niggas is still in jail, and I pray they don't tell
20-man inditement, my lawyer gotta fight this
Niggas know, I ain't never pressed for dough
And niggas know, I don't serve nobody I don't know
Son said he was from O.T., pay 11 an o.z.
My man brought em to me, see he ain't really know b
That it was hot, dude was a cop
He was just tryin to pop, to put the new beams on his drop
First I served him o.z.'s, then I served him whole keys
Now we all co-de's, damn man I O.D.
You know how it is on the street, niggas is holdin the heat
Po-Po walking to beat, we burnin l's up in the jeep
Ain't nothing sweet, we used to move so strategic
It's over I can't believe it, damn it's over
Fed's ceased the six, the Lex' and the Range Rover
Now a nigga rollin in a Toyota Corolla
Used to never get high, now I'm never sober
380-6 shot glock top load-up
Keep it in my waist son, I'll put one in your face
I ain't got nothing to lose, nigga so stay in your place
Just jumped bail, I ain't been on the run long
But it feel like a motherfuckin marathon

Bump Dat
Niggas try to stunt on my click 
Then when I get on that shit 
I bring it to 'em where they pump at
12 Gauge mashberg 
No shell in the head
Before you put in work, you gotta pump that
You done hit a nigga with it and you runnin to polices
Come and take my advice, nigga, dump that
This is serious, these rap niggas, I'm just havin fun with it
50 Cent, nigga, Bump Dat

[50 Cent]
My son ask "Daddy why carry a gun, you ain't a cop"
Looked at him and said "Sometimes you gotta shoot or get shot"
Wanna go to show-and-tell and show the class my glock?
Show 'em the clip
Show 'em the beam
Show 'em how Daddy lean
In the convertible Jag
22 inch mags
For a high school drop out, shit, that ain't bag
I'm not a blood or a crip, I'm doing my own thang
G-UNIT
Shit, I done started my own gang
I don't go that funny dance
I don't throw gang signs
But I'm a gangsta to the core so I stay with a nine
Think all I do is rap, then you don't know me good
Have Smurf hangin out the sun roof to light up your hood, man
Cause Lethal ain't never seen Blaco comin'
But if he did .. you think he woulda started runnin?
And I move with the Doublemint Twins and two macs
And leave you flat your back

I gotta half a mil deal with no diploma

Its hard to live, but its easy to die
So I'm going through life lookin death in the eye
These rappers ain't gun slingers
They R&B singers
G-Unit, come thru with some guerilla niggas
Minimum wage ain't gonna pay the rent
Cause the seats in the coupe got the Fendi print
And this shit right here for the listeners pleasure
I'm still on the strip with the fifth and my ever
Its T-O-N-Y
Stay with a semi
Milk your crack spot - till the shit be bone dry
You think you pump hard?  Nigga I pump harder
My phone ring so much, I walk around with the charger
When the D's come around, I'ma swallow my crack
Shit the work out later, and hit 'em with that
If it's a direct sale
I'ma change the bill
Tryin to push the new Range cause they changed the grille
Look nigga we icey thugs
We stay with them things so we stay with some Nike gloves

You should sit, scibble lines and see where it take ya
Had violent tendencies, so they thought I was dumb 
Why the so called smart kids was poppin' guns
I think about poppin' a gun, and then get the lump sum
Grampa my role model, yousta suck on a bottle
A pint a Crown Royal, make your insides boil
Been smell like Ben Gay, cause his back go out
He the one that taught me, what bein' black's about
Now peep the roach on the walls, that fall and crawl on my friend's 
Wrist, Sittin' up in them Benz, to be in the pen
In the hood we hit the number, but never the lotto
Life in the fast lane, one wheel hit the pothole
Let's go, let's flow nigga

[Chorus - Singing] - 2X
War, what is it good for absolutely nothin'
But niggas keep frontin'
Fuck a nigga, live like a soldier

See I always get my way girlfriend, I'm spoiled bad
Keep my hydro stashed in a Crown Royal bag
Your performance will determine the price

And 9 times outta 10, I was pissy when I was with you
But they don't make a liquor strong enough for me kiss you, nah

I don't fuck wit' scurry ass niggas
That ain't got a care in the world

Admit it, I'm that motherfuckin' nigga you lovin'
New York nigga, soundin' like I'm straight up southern
What bitch, don't try to play me close to see what I'm drinkin'
Yeah I'm rich, I ain't a trick, what the fuck are you thinkin'

Or 1 to 3, for an extra G
RIP to Etho, I miss Hevo
When I die, I hope heaven look like the ghetto (yeah)
Picture me trick, and take a loss

[Verse 2 - Tony Yayo]
I never mix money and product with my friends (uh huh)
These chips, make relationships come to an end (what)

And been on the block, ever since bunny tops (c'mon)
250 grizzies, scrape the plate (scrape that plate)
Got me on 750's straight from the plate (straight from the plate)
You can call on your soldiers, call your recruits (uh huh)
I do you dirty like Raheem did Dirty is "Juice" (Juice)
Allow myself, to introduce myself
This is Tony, the talk of New York, I'm holdin' the belt
I got thug in my blood (blood), game like a pimp (pimp)
And wrote my first verse, takin' baths in the sink (yeah)
And yo I fear no man son, I never heard of a fair one
Never gotta borrow a handgun
Niggas on the street, gettin' smoked like bran son
So I stay dirty like "Sanford and Son" (yeah)
Groupies gossipin' stay runnin' their lips (woo)
Cause they seen the Gucci seats in the 6 (uh huh)
And seen the Fendi grips on the four fifth (what)
Shit, I sell bricks, shit, I sell shit on a stick (stick)
Enough of the talkin', let's take it to the valance (uh huh)
The New York streets, will leave you physically challenged (challenged)
Don't be surprised, If I spit at you
Then come to your wake, and serve fiends at your funeral
Our bread is goin' towards a brick of dope
Cause I've been goin' hand and hand since "Different Strokes"
I'm a 50, an eighth, you a half a blunt
You the nigga in the mirror that practice stunts
WHAT!

Yeah nigga

And I'ma drink a lot a water 
And I'ma take Golden Seal, so my PO don't find out

Yo, niggas wouldn't rob Frankie if they had the chance
Wasn't cause of him it was cause of his man Lance
Frankie cut crack
Lance hold the Mac
If fiends fuck with Frankie's pac's
Lance cut the crack heads blocked up
Thought he was locked up
Came thru stuntin' wit his wrist all rocked up
Shoulda seen him smile, missin' the tooth
Coupe missin the roof
He like "What up, 50?"
I'm like "What up with you"
Lance had a reputation that was well earned
Heard he taught niggas how them shells burn
Out there in Red Firm
At the dice game, he rolled ahead, crapped in the crack
I'm like "Nah, I ain't paying for that!  Nigga, shoot it back"
Niggas lookin at me like I'm crazy, they shook
I don't give a fuck who he shot out in Red Hook
Asked him about ????
Yeah, Bizzy was my man till he beat me for ten grand and sold my Mac for
seven grand (Fuckin' crazy)
The man was crazy I could tell by his look
Cause he looked the way I look
When I look for a jooks
Bitch

[Skip]
Everytime I'm in the kitchen, you in the kitchen
Let me finish this brick, 'fore you put that fish in
Listen, I know we just came from fishin
But I'm on a mission, you see, there's money that I'm missin
I got 'em posted, so the move and I'm gonna murder y'all
You and all the trouble goin through by servin y'all
And only cause my man heard of y'all
Other than that, shit, y'all won't get served at all

[Tony Yayo]
I went from oodles and noodles to lobster and shrimp
I went from bare bubble coats, to brand new minks
And yo my neck upgraded, my wrist's upgraded
I stay C of F, I ain't got time for Jacob
I'm still on the strip, tryin to get my grims off
Nigga tryin to flip and its a Mexican stand off
I put a hole in your grill, with the nine mil
Dressed in all black, lookin for souls to steal

[Chorus] - 2X
Little bit of dust, little bit of cocaine
Little bit of dro, little bit of heroine
A little bit of ecstacy
That's why your bitch want to be next to me
We sell a little bit a everything

[Young Buck]
I put the two Mags, up to your doo rag
And rockaby baby, I'm in the blue Jag with new tags, in case you wanna chase
I never knew that, the impact, comin up out a Desert Eagle
A make a nigga wob and wiggle screamin call my people
We got these fiends pourin liters, and they shootin needles
Need to be takin your connection, cause we got it cheaper
Shit I ain't new to this, I met this air stewardess
Who knows the ins and outs on how to get it in and out, nigga

[Lloyd Banks]
Ya if I put a dress code all black, nine hows and a laser
And the party is an ink pen, bottle, or a razor
Your hollerin for praise ya, catch me in the hood with a model named Taysha
And the swallow game major
These cowards ain't gangsta, they tellin you lies by sellin you dreams
And they ain't fill ins, they fiends
Plus they rat, and it's too hot to chill in the sun
My pops 39 years old, and still on the run

[Chorus]

[Juvenile]
Wodie what you want, you want dope, you want coke
Wodie what you want, you want X, you want dro
Shit you got beef, I got a tec and a fo'
You feelin' hot and moist, I even get you a ho
If you don't got no whip, I get you a car
If you don't got no skills, I get your some more
My nigga we don't cut it, we serve it raw
Got anythin you want, play us awful hard

[50 Cent]
My 22's bling, so niggaz scheme
745i clean, this little shell nigga, fuck a triple beam 
Coffee pot to cook coke, Joe to smoke, I was born to loc
Method cut the coke, 50 no joke
I ain't "Scarface", no women, no kids, I don't give a fuck 
Better teach that bitch, and that little nigga to duck
With a P-90 Ruger, I put shots all through ya
If you survive you gonna feel what talent do to ya

[Chorus]

[Intro]
New York City (New York City), you are now rackin' with 50 Cent (with 50 Cent)
Are you ready? (are you ready?) (*gun cocks*) I said are you ready? (are you ready?)
See you with me nigga? (with me nigga) Drop that! (drop that)
Paid for a hooptie but I wanted a drop

[Verse 1]
G-UNIT! Somethin' new, somethin' new
I'm not that nigga, in your video
I'm not a trick, I don't love the hoes
And niggas know I be, on the low
But I miss my dough, and I twist my dro
I'm not that nigga, that you think you know
I walk around with a big four four
You front on me, I'm gonna get at you dog
I be right at your crib, waitin' at your door
(What up bitches)

[Verse 2]
Comin' up I ain't had much, I wanted a lot
I had paper for a hooptie, but I wanted a drop
So you know, I had to make somethin' out of nothin' (Yeah)
Like turn an empty spot, into a crack spot pumpin' (woo)
Also hard at 19, I bought a Benz I did
The older niggas really wasn't feelin' the kid
Tried to find out where I lived, so they could run in my crib
But you can't hustle a hustler, I peeped in a sled
Back then niggas yousta call me boo
In 6 months, I sold a million gold tops on got brew
Country came around, ease it and clappin' then
Country left, strange shit started happenin'
Like C shot Ra for some ends, Ra shot Dro for some chins
Cory shot Drew, and we was friends
Money turns boys into men
The cycle never changes, shit just starts again

[Verse 3]
Nah nigga, ain't nothin' change nigga
Yeah I've been gone for a minute, but I'm back
Damn 50 good to see you back in the hood
You see my cherry red SL, nigga I'm doin' good
Sometime I can't find the words to say how I feel
So I take a quote from Menace, "look at the wheels"
I'm addicted to stuntin', now that I'm holdin' somethin'
I got a trunk full of guns, from VA today
(oh yeah, let me hold somethin')
Nigga you high or somethin'
I don't play games, I'm about my money, nigga buy somethin'
I got a few fifths, I got a few nines
Here nigga, take one, catch it took, and bring me mine

[Outro - 50 Cent talking]
Yeah, don't ever say I don't do nothin' for you nigga
You know, uh, don't say I don't look out for ya
Ya know what I mean, but make sure you nigga, you go catch some jokes
And you come back, nigga have 'em, and have my paper for that thang thang
You know what I'm sayin'? Say I don't want it back, nigga don't try to use it
And don't get it back for me, nigga and no shit like that
In fact, I can see ya'll niggas now
Run around sayin', 50 gettin' all this rap money, and he won't help us (haha)
Sit tight nigga I'm comin'
You know, new shit, all this shit I put out on the mixtapes
Is for the mixtapes, I got a million, OH MY GOD!
My shit is so hot right now, I'm in a zone

[Chorus - 50 Cent] (Tweet)

[Tony Yayo - talking over 2nd part of chorus]
Yeah, um, YAYO!

[Tony Yayo]
Don't call me bitch, don't be naggin me
Cause the police thinkin 'bout baggin me (baggin me)
You wanna call me on my cell, but don't got money for bail
And you the main reason that I'm stuck in the jail
You showed 'em where the Mag at (uh huh), showed 'em where the stash at (uh huh)
Got a order of protection, no I'm doin five flat
In my heart I thought you was the one
"Til you dialed them three numbers 9 1 1 (BITCH)

[Chorus - 50 Cent] (Tweet)
(Call me) Why you naggin me?

(*Starts off with the beat of Tweet's "Call Me,"
then changes over to Bubba Sparxxx & Jadakiss' "They Ain't Ready")

[Intro - 50 Cent talking]
Uh, yeah, G-Unit, uh, yeah 50 Cent, uh, yo

[Chorus 1 - 50 Cent, imitating Timbaland]
Timbaland sounds so good, but I might not be ready
I don't know
If I spend a 100 grand on the beat, then we done bumped already
Now here we go

(*harmonizing over the beat - doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
(doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo) (Pee Wee Herman)
(doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
(Niggaz look down to Pee Wee Herman)

[50 Cent - Verse 1]
50, lefty, no gun in my right palm
Bronx niggaz love me, like they think our mics on (WOO)
These rap niggaz not like me, they too soft (yeah)
Get shot down, I get up, shakin' shit off
You know white collar crooks, do jokes on lap tops (uh huh)
Real niggaz snatch glocks, and run up in spots
We can talk Trump talk, real estate, stocks, and bonds
Or gangsta shit, my Rugers and glocks in palm (uh huh)
Danger, ring the alarm, kiss the ring of the Don
I conquer like Genghis Kahn, I said song in this song (god damn)
I won't hesitate to put a knife or a slug in you
And watch you bleed out, that little bit of thug in you
You don't want to bump heads with me, and get hit up
You, you ain't got what it takes to fuckin' get up
Holla niggaz names on records, that shit is played out
But holla mine in your next line, and get layed out

[50 Cent - Chorus 2]
My jewels look so good, and my chain is so heavy
I don't know
If I should stunt for these hos again, cause I did that already
Now here we go

[Lloyd Banks - Verse 2]
(Lloyd Banks) I don't give a fuck if your favorite rapper dies, to me thats my spot
I'll celebrate his burial and eat at IHOP (yeah)
I've been hungry since a little nigga weed in my high top (Woo)
Face burgundy red, in need of a eye drop (uh huh)
I had the black Delta Force, blue in the front
Back when Jordan was flyin', and Ewing could dunk
Of course, you can fuck now, you was buyin' the shrimp then
Me on the other hand, Don Bishop and Pimp King
(*harmonizing of "doo, doo" plays in backgroud until G-Unit is yelled)
I'm runnin' from a digital Munster
I do this for the hood and every kid in a dumpster
My name is poppin', and I ain't been at it long
My neck's 16, and made Flex drop a Benz latin bomb (G-UNIT!)
I'm the best thing to happen to hip hop
Since (uh huh) "Life After Death" and that Tupac shit drop
I'm even good to a white boy with a slick top
Stuck up in the mountains with a gun and the wrist pop
Who? where?, Master P says our watch don't tick tock
I'm cleanin' out my 6 shot, watchin' the Knicks flop
Damn near the whole damn passenger green
Thats how my bedroom, look like the World Trade after the scene (smoking)
Breaking news, hijack, bus passenger scream (yeah)
I'm your worst nightmare, I crush half of your team
To me your line up is pussy, three wet Pampers
The uzi will have you shakin' like them G-Dep dancers (damn dude)

(*50 Cent - harmonizing "doo,doo,doo"*]

*beat stops

[Lloyd Banks]
What the fuck happen to the rest of the beat man?

(50 Cent laughing)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Everywhere I'm at everywhere I go, I stay surrounded by hoes
Even when I'm tryin to be on the low, I'm recognized by hoes
Man, its gotta be cause of the dough, its got to be cause of the dough
Cause the game sure wasn't like this before, it wasn't like this before

[Verse One]
50 Cent I'm makin hits now
Don't try an act like you ain't heard I'm the shit now
Some bitches changed, cause they know I'm fittin to blow
You should see how they react when I come through the door
In the club my niggaz, we fittin to ball out
Drink till we fall out
Some shit jump off, nigga we goin all out
Shots big enough to tear the fuckin wall out
I'll have your punk ass on the dance floor tryin to crawl out
I had bad luck, then my luck changed up
You see the Range, you see the rims all blinged up
You ain't hear what I charge for 16, I'm makin a killin
These other rap niggaz just catching feelings

(Chorus)

Haha, yeah
Yeah that's it nigga, what the fuck you thought
I ain't giving niggaz more than 16 for a motherfuckin freestyle
The fuck you want for free man
Ya'll niggaz be wanting a lot for free man
Fuck them other niggaz, other niggaz can't rap
That's why they give you 100 motherfuckin bars for nothing man
You know what I mean

Haha, the fuck man

Lloyd Banks in the house, bad news
Tony Yayo in the house, bad news
50 cent in the house, bad news whenever 50 around it's bad news
Tray pound's in the house, bad news
40 Kal's in the house, bad news
I got a knife in the house, bad news whenever 50 around it's bad news

[Lloyd Banks]
Niggaz mad cause I'm flossin' bad
I ain't a wrestler, but I'll put your bitch the Boston crab
I talk money cause it costs to brag
Round here bitches walk around wit the hair that the horses had
Rap it get your face stuck on them bricks
I don't really like to exercise but I'll push up on a bitch 
Y'all sweet like ninety-nine bananas 
That's why I got ninety-nine niggaz wit ninety-nine hammers
They all want a nigga to stop
Cause I rap slick enough to slip the ring off of Vivica Fox
I'm just a playa that found out where the coaches know
That's why I'ma be around longer than the Oprah show
You and your man y'all both should know 
That all it takes is a finger to send you where the ghosts go
Shit I been hated since the fifth grade
That's why my best friend the tray pound, a ice pick, and a switch blade

[Chorus]
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, Banks' back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, Tony's back at it again)

[Tony Yayo]
Rule number one pick a target and study him for weeks
See where they rest at and lay with their peeps
Now you got the drop, know their daily routine
So the second rule please leave the crime scene please
Third rule pick a day, fourth rule pick a time
Fifth rule pick a fifth, sixth rule pick a nine
And the seventh rule make sure your sidearm sweet 
So when the shootout you leave him six feet deep
Eighth meet in a fast car with disguise
Use a ski mask with shades on your eyes
Ninth rule don't say shit cause po-po listen
Fuck around you end up being stuck in the system
And the tenth rule don't put a tag on a broken heart
Just put a toe-tag on your mark
And rule number 11, you caught a body but you not a legend
You better watch where you heading

[Chorus]
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)

[50 Cent]
Don't go go against me I'll hurt your feelings
Stones in my cross the size of your earrings
My confidence level's high nigga can't tell
Lickin my lips at ya bitch like I'm LL
I smile like a nigga in jail receiving mail
Better yet like nigga Bookers that made bail
From day one I came in the game they said I was hot
They got scared, "Cent got money," and I got shot
You so much pressure on me when you compare me to 'Pac
I'm just a new kid, I can't help that I'm hot
What little niggaz say to 50 cent don't matter
I'll fire shots at the chef and watch the sheeps scatter
My enemies never turn into friends, my friends turn into enemies
You scared then get the fuck around me
Record execs, know not to play wit my check
I come through with my knife cause I'm a pain your neck (YEAH!)

[Chorus]
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)

Lloyd Banks in the house, bad news

Catch ya slippin' i'ma give you what I got for ya
My clip loaded wit' 16 shots for ya
Never had a hot gun on your waist and blarin' to shoot
Cause a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you?
Homie you ain't been through what I been through
You not like me and i'm not like you
I'm like a animal wit' it when I spit it it's crazy
Got semi-autos to put holes in niggaz tryina play me
One shot is not enough you need least a uzi to move me
After four bottles of Dom the kid start feelin' woozy
I write my life you write what you seen in gangsta movies
I'm gangsta to the core nigga you can't move me
I found my space at the top I got this rap shit locked
I never heard of you you heard of me I murder you
Spit shells through your convertible
Lowest you notice?
Rich or poor hollows still go through your door, this is raw
You scared of me you not prepared for me the kid is back

[Scarlett] We from the Harlem streets
[50 Cent] E, F
[Scarlett] Don't talk me to death
[50 Cent] G, H
[Scarlett] It's elementary

[Scarlett]
Picture me rolling Range Rover
Same color your Air Force Ones
White on white, ya like?
Red I flight the night
From L.A. to N.Y.
I'm Harlem bound
You see how bitches tense up, when Scarlett 'round
Niggas get the heart to holla while we up in the club
But get intimidated when they see me sitting on dubs
I hear 'em whispering " dat ain't a man, shit that's her."
She roll with them G Unit niggas, that's what's up
Disrespect me, I'll have niggas blast ya up
Take my advice, don't let ya peoples grass ya up
I got a fetish for the chips
20's for the six
Hollows for the clips
Try me, if you think I'm playing bitch
And the police we'll have another crime scene taker
Jim Star crush your head, give your ass a shape-up
Uptown niggas known for the money they make
Everybody ain't shook, you see doing the shake

[50 Cent][Hook]
The boss spending ends
Saying, "Gimme that Benz, 20 inch rims, and four TV's"
The snitch in the precinct saying
"He sell X, he sell techs, and he sell D"
The balla by the bar saying, 
"Everybody drink, the best champagne, it's all on me"
Snitch in the back of the police car
Pointing out the window saying, "He robbed me"
It's elementary

[Lloyd Banks]
1,2,3,4
[50 Cent]
Lloyd Banks' in the house
[Lloyd Banks]
Now get the fuck on the floor
I slid through the front door
With the 9 and the velour
A cal in my pocket
You wil', I'mma pop it
I'm down for a profit
I'm ghetto as hell
You can't you tell?
My road dog, under the jail
Getting frustrating mail
So I'm drinking and smoking
Thinking and hoping
This cell gon' open
You can dance next to me, but don't throw an elbow
I'll throw one back and leave blood on your Shell Toes
Hell no
I ain't paying for pleasure
Your pussy don't bring rainbows and pots of treasure
It's every girl's dream, to floss with the team
Long on the suine
DVD's on the screen
Blowing on cream
Waiting for you to scheme
You ain't gotta know how to read, to spray a magazine

[Hook]

[Tony Yayo]
I don't wanna grow up, I'mma hustler kid
Go'head and stunt, see I don't pop two your wig
I'm artistic, intelligent, so much ability
When I use them big words, your bitch be feeling me
So ya'll niggas hate me, 'cause your wives be our groupies
Ya'll irritate me, like loud people in the movies
Fall back, matter fact back down
'Cause I just passed security without no pat down
You can catch me in the bathroom blowing a sticky
Or catch me on the dancefloor feeling some tits
Sex sells, so I'mma P-I-M-P
So my pockets never be empty
It ain't no problem, we scoop them models
We got condoms, coups, and lavish condos
50 got me getting ass like I never did
So when I step in the club, hoes love the kid

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
The cat in the house go
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
The bird in the cage go
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet
It's elementary

[50]
Nah, I don't be fuckin wit them fat bitches

[Chorus]
Don't be stuck on the things they say

[50]
Them Twinkies got your ass gettin' fat fat
Them cookies got your ass gettin' fat fat
That paint got your ass gettin' fat fat
Bitch you grown, that ain't baby fat fat

In the gym I see your ass up on the stair master
But you got it on level 2, bitch go a little faster
Look girl I ain't gon lie, I'll tell you how I feel
They should hand cuff your big ass to the treadmill
You wanna work out now, cause you know its gettin' hot
And your big ass fin to pop all up out the halter top
Find the right chick, wearing some tight shit, and it's on
See your ass wearing some tight shit, we like "She wrong"

[Chorus]
Don't be stuck on the things they say
now you know it's a nasty world (know it's a nasty world)

That Burger King dun got your ass fat fat
McDonald's dun got your ass fat fat
That Dominos dun got your ass fat fat
Yeah, It's nothin' but a little baby phat phat

[Lloyd Banks]
I like 'em slim in the waste, curves in the right place
A bitch wit hips, lips, and a nice face
Your appetite'll put a dent up in a nigga salary
You need to stop burnin that weed, and burn a calorie
Your attitude is like you always have gear
You got a pony tail, you ain't always have hair
I just wanna see your Capri's comin' down
Mami we run the town, stay away if you 300 pounds

[Chorus]
Don't be stuck on the things they say
now you know it's a nasty world (know it's a nasty world)
I ain't fuckin wit you anyway
cause I know your a nasty girl - You's a nasty girl (know your a nasty girl)
I ain't never gon discriminate
so let me compliment your eyes

[50]
I'll say something nice about ya eyes, cause you's a big bitch man
Yeah, It's nothin' but a little baby phat phat
Them Entenmann's dun got your ass fat fat
Them Little Debbie's dun got your ass fat fat
These cup cakes dun got your ass fat fat
Yeah, It's nothin' but a little baby phat phat

[Tony Yayo]
I ain't no trick, I ain't have to borrow with my wallet
Freakin' off in your car, on your closet
It ain't nothing wrong wit a big, strong girl
If you can cook your ass off, I'll give you the world
You can be skinny or fat, white or black
Nigga pussy is pussy so, yeah, I'll hit that
I'm a freak, sure I love minage a trois
And I really care lees if you twice my size

[Chorus]
Don't be stuck on the things they say

Them Twinkies got your ass gettin' fat fat
Them cookies got your ass gettin' fat fat
That paint got your ass gettin' fat fat
Bitch you grown, that ain't baby fat fat

Stay the fuck away from, you fuckin fat bitch
Fuck wit Tony Yayo, ho

[50 Cent]
Yo, yo we can't stay alive forever
So if shit hit the fan then we might as well die together
I'm high as ever, more holes and more cheddar
G-Unit move around wit them pounds and berreta's
Yea faggot, if I want it I'm gon' have it
Regardless if it's handed to me or I gotta grab it
Don't make a ass outta yaself tryin to stop me
I'm cocky, raps rocky, nigga you sloppy
You know that I'm, 8 levels above you nigga
I'll club you nigga, I never heard of you nigga, ugly nigga
I'm the wrong one to provoke
You rattin on niggas is only gon' leave you smoke
So the only thing left now is tools for these cowrads
I got no friends, fuck most of these cowards
They pop shit 'till we start approaching these cowards
While we lay around dollars, they lay around flowers

[Lloyd Banks]
I got a intergangstress who argue and steams wit reefer
And who flip when I call a bitch like she Queen Latifah
Not all the vehicle's is long enough to stash the streetsweeper
This shit can get uglier than the Master P sneaker
We slidin through the ruckus, wit prada on the chuckus
Soon as spring break ho's home from college wanna fuck us
I ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckas
I'll sick rottweiler's on you fuckas, cops followin to cuff us
Top dollars to discuss this, whole lotta zeros
When it comes to paper I blow a soul outta aero
I'ma break before I lay floor berry
Besides, every rapper ain't a star, nigga plad ain't bulbary
You can't tame Lloyd, smokin by the big screen
You changin the channel looks like I'm playin the game boy
I know to watch botherin ya vision
You reach and I'll put a dot on ya head like its part of yo religion
Why party wit a pigeon?
I'm blowin a 10 cuz Bush handin flyers for a party in a prison
I'm in the gucci vest wit the green and red straps
I'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack
Now every morning's a fast start
And there aint problem gettin dressed cuz my closet got more aisles than pathmark
Run, move startin a wave
and leave wit 12 shells in ya mouth like a carton of eggs
I'm the young pimp pardon my age
I don't got long hair but if I did she be puttin my braids
Niggas find what club they at
take 'em wit us, and run a train on 'em like a subway mac
get advances from grey agra
see these record labels got most artists gettin fucked like the gay rappa'
i go the college on the tour
I'm goin down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur
I keep ya ammo clean, text polished in the drawer
Camera's by the hamper that mine into the floor
by now, you probably heard of me
fresh outta surgery, flashy as a fuck, you gon' have to murder me
Burglary, I'm leavin wit cha nike's bergendy, White T, bergendy
you match now, back down
niggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear
catch me on the boat wit weed smoke and official gear
heavy when I toke, C notes from different years
Besly in the robe, re-motes for liftin chairs
You ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya
I send cars to crib like I'm a cab dispatcha
you better off wit ya stupid guys, lookin for a coupe to drive
you ain't gettin nuttin but ya french fries supersized
it's a damn shame y'all still local
I'm in a million dollar studio layin my vocals
Nigga

[50 Cent]

Back seat of the Benz truck or Expo
Back seat of X5 or Range Rov'
So when I pick you up, you know how this shit go - hoe

[Tony Yayo]
Hey yo, my truck talk for me
If I was bummy and ugly
Your bitch'll still have love for me
As long as I push a truck, rims chunky
Never open my lips, your bitch wanna fuck me
Beep the air horn, hop in turn the heat on
Pick you up off the streets get your feet warm
She giving sex cause the Lex truck takes unleaded
Big thick thighs, eyes browner than Sahara deserts
Deuce-Deuce, bitches, yeah they caught your eye
And them loud system full of bass and highs
You see that X5 BM
Packed with Puerto Ricans
Bad mommies on the low, just creepin
Niggas be frontin like they bubbling coke
But they really struggling with a high car note, ha ... (YEAH)

[50 Cent]
Might see me in the Jeep
Rollin' 'round 4 deep
And you know we on the creep
Nigga, I'm holdin' it

[Hook]

[Tony Yayo]
Back seat of my truck lets swing an episode 
Fuck a hotel we have sex on the road
I pull the seats back
Put the sheets in the luggage rack
Pull out my balls
And play an Aaron Hall track 
I tell a chick "Bend over, mami"
Hit 'em with the Henny Dick
Now my windows foggy
Its time to party, I got TV's, CD's and DVD's
Now bitch, get on your knees
You could be a model chick or a silly hood rat
Don't cum on my leather, don't stain my floor mats
Where's your baby mama?
She in the truck and I'm blessin her 
Undressing her
Make hop out for air re-freshener
I ain't stressing her
'Cause my rims keep checkin her
She's 21, my rim size older than her
TWENTY TWO'S

[50 Cent]
Niggas say they want beef
But when they see me in the street
They don't slow down to speak 
'Cause they know I'm holdin ..

[Hook] 

(chorus)
When you frown at me is it because I wont provide for you girl

And you friends they see it to screaming we know what your up to do girl
I'm after my cheddar

(50 cent)
I gave you your style Gucci this Fendi that
Burberry bag shoes and the hat to match
I like the way it look but bitch I aint buying that
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but no more Prada shoes
When I just wanna chill you wanna go out
See me parle with some other chick you wanna show out
You say I'm wrong when I dog yo ass like I should
now you reminisce about all the time I treated you good

(chorus)

(Lloyd Banks)
when you think about me grinding my fans
You even got more watch on but it's to much time on your hands
They say behind every good man is a woman
So tash pull up stash the cannon linen
I'll never be your chofuer to the mall
You'll learn to appreciate cd's and posters on the wall
fatal attractions is mad real
Last bitch I deaded got mad and swallowed 50 Advil's

(chorus)

(Tony Yayo)
They say money make the world go round
Material things make a hoe go down
I see you in your Prada Gucci and BCBG
Bitch I'm rich but I don't trick on GP
That's 5 dollar dresses and 10 dollar skirts
Bitch play the strip and put in work
Birds wanna have my baby since I signed my contract
Now I got to double up in case the condom snap

(50 cent)
Look don't ask me for shit man
I aint got nothing for you man what?
Bitch what the fuck you mean I can't sing bitch
Bitch I'm Luther Vandross in the shower

[50 Cent]
It's a fact homie, eagles don't fly in flocks
But the eagles I got own sixteen shots
Like beefin', homie I ain't sayin' a word
I'll run up on your punk ass squeezing the bird
Now what New York niggas know about country grammar
Not much, but we know how to bang them hammers
When I pull out that thing, you better break yourself
Or win a trip to ICU, and you can take yourself
If you lucky motherfucker, I'm solider I told ya
Push ya shit back, put my knife through ya six pack
Gat bust, adrenaline rush, blowin' the dust
Five point O, burnin' the cluth, while I'm burnin' the dutch
You thought them other niggas was hot, I'm turnin' it up
This the blueprint, nigga are you learnin' or what
You done told me you respect me, now tell me I'm the nicest
Admit it nigga, I'm a mid-life crisis

[Hook]
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! (I got the rep of a villian, the weapon concealin')
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! (full of controversy until I retire my jersey)

[Lloyd Banks]
It's like niggas rate the respect of who gat bigger
Banks been blowin' on purple stuff before that fat nigga
Henny's make dollars, and dollars make death threats
I'm doin' remixes to bulletproof the Lex next
Duck nigga, everdays war
I'm heavy on sports, to my draw like NBA's store
Don't make me send the piece at you
I'll have your man walk around with another rest in peace tattoo
Look creampuff, you can get killed here
Nigga you ain't invincible, even Superman in a wheel chair
I've always been a picky man, but I ain't a flowered star
So I'mma fuck all fifty fans
Look, whether you like it or not, right in ya spot
All in your grill, wearin' the crown, airin' em down
We're in the pound puttin' fare in the clown
I'm running with gangstas, don't make one of em shank ya

[Hook]
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang

[Tony Yayo]
I'mma ride with my rap shit and my body armor
Ride like a Taliban suicide bomber
Four five six feet, I off ya feet
I kill ya with a pillow when you fall asleep
Your records can't sell, your company is buyin' em
Give it up, Burger King is hirin'
You shoulda been a cop, cause you snitch a lot
Talkin' to the jakes, you bound to get shot
I used to watch Big Bird and Scooby Doo
Now I'm choppin' big birds and them bundles too
For that Master P money, that shoppin' spree money
That coke, that dope and that ecstasy money
I'm tryin' to build empires across the state line
So move like vampires, never see me in the daytime
I jump out with a nina and a mack
I have you like Khia, my neck, my back

[50 Cent]
Ga ga G-Unit! (body) haha, yo, yo

I need no introduction, everybody (body)
Heard of 50 Cent, and heard of G-Unit
I'm not Hi-Tek and I'm not Kweli (Kweli) - you see me in the club
You better tell the bouncers to treat me special, I'm somebody (body)
Cause I get on that jet, in 5 minutes flat
Niggaz'll come back, shoot up your party (party)
If I don't have fun, nobody havin' none
I'm tryin' to holla at ya, come here shorty (shorty)
Shout out to my nigga Juvie, Wacko's here
Buck, my niggaz from New Orleans, wodie (wodie)
If we on the same page, when you see me on stage
You gonna throw your hands up, and you gonna applaud me (plaud me)
You know how I get, I'm still on that bullshit, nigga, nigga

[Tony Yayo]
I run around with the trey (body) pound like its a sport
And call my name in the bench, while I sit in court
I got a million dollar smile (body), and a fist full of pesos
And the wrist so icey, it could light up a stage show
In the club (body), nigga I stay holdin'
Cause I'm on point for them wolves, and sheep clothin'
I play the bar (body), with a double shot of Henny
Cause after this spot, its cheaters, and envy
(Shorty if you feel a nigga, call me) (body)

[Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, Banks, yeah
Look you ain't got to like me, that's (body) cool, I don't give a fuck
Clowny time ain't gonna put me in a bigger truck
Fuck kids, it (body) ain't my turn to be stressed
A bitch worse nightmare is a paternity test
I'm too young to be faithful (body)
If money means love, I hate you
I only trick on the first of April
Holla at me, if you thugged (body) out shorty ready to fight you
Dice, roll a blunt, and pull the snub out for me
And if your not don't even (body) call me

(*gun shot fired, yelling*)

Yo, niggas be askin me "yo 50 who you got beef wit?"
I'm a tell yall niggas who I got beef wit
I got beef wit any nigga I can't make no money wit
If I can't make no money wit you, fuck you nigga
G-Unit nigga, thats whatsup cause I said thats whatsup

[Tony Yayo]
I get money, money I got
so its a 100 grams or better when I'm going to cop
I never hold the toaster cause I use my little soldier
And my down bitch as a holster, like I'm supposed ta
heavy pistol sales for living
my gun rip through lungs and tear through tissue
while  I'm out for the ends, you out for a rep
thats the same thing that have yo mama in a black dress
see me in a black lex, hard-top
My mink drop-top, fresh out the carlot
I got the gift of raw pugilist speeches(?)
So I'm gon sell like the box office features
Niggas in the hood can't see G-UNIT!
but deep in they heart they wanna be G-UNIT!
cause we got them three b's: benzes, burners and bitches
and plus we on the road to the riches

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You can say what you want about me
As long as you don't get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out

[Lloyd Banks]
Lately I been going through a phase
Hope they aint tap the phones
Cause we got pumps the size of saxophones
Therefore I'm on the move with the squad
I'm stingy as ever, known to trick fast food on a broad
Picture me putting jewels on a broad
I'd rather put shoes on the car
A pool in the yard
You don't really wanna fool with the god
Nigga my front line long enough to fill two boulevards
In this game, you only make it far if you loyal
And if you grew up with your mother and your father you spoiled
Why swing, you gotta be strapped to get rid of me
Ill leave you in water like the statute of liberty
Tryin to be cool
Blowin green that strong enough to make a white boy open fire on a school
Keep rappin for your hood, I'm rappin for benzes
And long assault rifles with straps on the lenses

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Yall niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!!)
What I learned from Gotta Rock and Spank G (Un-Huh)
Yall niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!!)
What I learned from watching Brucie B
Look, I shot the sheriff
And nigga if you get too close yo punk ass getting shot
Here's the plan, I'm a keep stackin my ends
Till I'm on airplane seats in the Maebach benz
I'm all about the chips
I done took them trips
22's on the 6
26 on the bricks
And them outta town niggas, I'm chargin yall more
I tapdance on the shit I aint servin it raw
You sell smoke, look nigga I got what you need
But it aint goin cheap I got mouths to feed
Niggas always sayin damn 50 you bugged
Cause I got hoes giving niggas the date rape drug
Gimme his watch and his chain
We not the same, he a lame
He want pussy I'm bout my money man
Crap table in Vegas had his bitch on my dick
Threw a 7 so many times they thought the dice was fixed
Yo its 50, when your mindframe change and start to rearrange
I'll see you another day motherfucker it's 50
Shots 'til your heart drop and freeze up, ease up motherfucker

[Chorus]

I don't hesitate to pull out the burnin' nigga
I stick my snub nose in shit, that don't concern a nigga
I'm the reason that Coupe, ain't got no top
I'm the reason that Rouger, ain't got no shots
And when I squeeze, I tend to keep on squeezin'
If your lucky, you can run, and keep on breathin' (yeah)
When my knife hit ya windpipe and you start wheezin' (huh)
You put your hand over the hole, and it gonna stop the breathin' (woo)
I am what I am, and I ain't gonna change

Trust me, I'm not what you used to homie (grrr)
You little faggot, I'll tell ya fuckin' boss to blow me (uh huh)
I'm puttin' pressure on you, you payin' the pump (yeah)
About to die like a man, but you live like a chump (uh huh)

I can't wait to see you scatter, when I pull out and dunk ya (TAKE THAT)

[ Chorus ]
50, it's 50, it's 50, motherfucker (uh huh)

You spend a lot of time talkin about how you ball out

Why you screamin' war senseless, I'm tryin' to spaz
Swing my knife, tore break it off in yo ass
Niggas get hugged up in the huddle, I know how to clear 'em out
Four fifth, four shots, that'll fuckin' air 'em out
In the hood niggas love me cause I keep it real
G-Unit niggas, they gon' always make bail

[50 Cent talks till end]

[50 Cent]
I wanna be the reason you smile after you wipe ya tears
The reason you have the courage to confront ya fears
The reason there's two karats in each of ya ears
I splurge with the paper ma, I don't care
How you like it, pumps or boots, jeeps or coops
Minks or leathers, fifty fall off never
Whats mine is yours and whats yours is mine
So when I shine, you shine
The finest champagne, we can toast to life
Crap table in Vegas, you can toss the dice
Don't let ya fears let you confuse sayin' "fifty's bad news"
I need you in my life girl, your too much to lose

[Beat switches]

[Hook]
Nigga, you won't deny that I'ma fuckin' ride out
Then you'll bump heads wit me

That it ain't cool to fuck wit me

[Tony Yayo]
G-Unit, I roll wit gorillas
Fuck a big body guard, I hang wit pint size killas
I ain't tryin' to be dirty, still on the strip
I'm tryin' to be dirty, filthy rich
Give a nigga too much rope, he think he a cowboy
Give Tony too much dope, I'm pushin' the big boy
V12, SL detailed
I rap and wait for them checks in the mail
If you hatin', your due time life will expire
Cause my guns speak jamaican, they be like "Bloodfire!"
Where I'm from, niggas be on some sleak shit
They hungry, use they lighters to cook their beef stick
And this 'dro and this nestle got me right
So my lungs be as black as Wesley Snipes
I'm on first class flights heading towards Vegas
Ya slot machines niggas, we crap table players
I roll a seven, cause we crap table players

[Hook]
Nigga, you won't deny that I'ma fuckin' ride out
Then you'll bump heads wit me
I'll put a hole in yo ass, you'll see
That it ain't cool to fuck wit me

[Lloyd Banks]
I know a lot of niggas want Banks gone
My kind of beef will fuck up ya grill and not the kind you put franks on
I'm hidin' out, so my meals is home cooked
I deal wit more ho's than a chinese phone book
Your high with your messed up ratchets
I'm out blowin' haze bags the size of ketchup packets
Fuck who's in ya ride, there's tools on my side
By the females standin' with tattoos on they thighs
There's a lot of cats losin' they wives
Cause next time I see 'em, they got black and blues on they eyes
Nah, I ain't ready to die, but I'm prepared
But I'd rather grow old with grey hairs in my beard
They know me in the field, the kid with the fans
That argue over my balls like Kobe and Shaquille
If you talkin' bout millions throw me in the deal
Big city, stadium tour, ruining the bill motherfucker

[Male voice talking]
Right now with the situation gettin' better
So I'm doin' you things, holla

[50 Cent]
Yeah, 50 Cent, uh huh, check me out

I'm wild as ever, foul as ever
Reap whatever, whatever, whatever
They say I'm a slick talker, shit talker
Grimy ass New Yorker
Come gutcha, gum futcher, lay your ass out
If you ever catch beef nigga, call on me
If you fucked up in school nigga, it's all on me
I get a left foot to drop a nigga, pistol to pop a nigga
Break you off proper nigga, the cops ain't gonna stop a nigga (yeah)
Let's get this money man, them hos come with the paper 
I'm done to go wherever this game takes us
Look homey, you see my 22's, sittin' on low bros
That simple mathematics, that equal more hoes
I smoke a lot of dro, I got a lot of flows
Shit I didn't have to say that, ya'll already know

[Chorus] - 2X
From New York to New Orleans
A problem, holla at me

If everythin' is alright

Ya'll niggas can blow some trees
Have coke and some Hennessey
My niggas from U.T.P.
Everythin' is alright

[Young Buck]
For those who couldn't figure me out, what this nigga be bout
Cookin' it, and cuttin' it, and flippin' it, in 24 hours
I keep a dyke, on the back of the bike
In the summertime the white
Air Force One's, Louie Baton, Nike style (woo)
Don't really talk much (uh huh), I let my money speak
I know you saw us, shit we a 100 deep
I'm sippin' Don, with Juan, Bird, and smokin' weed
Shakin' them haters off, bouncin' to this jukin' beat
Fuckin' with 50, cause he strictly about head bustin'
Lettin' New York know these Unica niggas ain't stuntin'
Nigga we ain't runnin', I guarantee you that
After these messages we'll be right back
Take off that necklace a, because this tech will hit a
Innocent bystander who don't respect a nigga
After you finish your collard greens and cornbread
Get you a glock, and come around here where my mom stayin'

[Chorus]

[Skip]
From South I 95, 85, 65 right at the I 10, get your money widened
I got the Columbian, and I'm gonna hold 'em down
When you get close, call nigga I'm gonna guide you down
You got it now, (got it), well then what time you leavin'?
In a couple of hours, some time close to this evenin'
What us speed with V8, them cops then heated
They locked my partner Gus up for smokin' weed and speedin'
But he'll be home though, probably about the same time you get ya
Shit yeah, seems like we paid his bond like last year
But anyway, you know that thing we thought that was, but wasn't?
Well come to find out, my homey found somethin'
But he had to choke a bitch, and fo' pound somethin'
Cause I told him, what you told me about the chump and he chumped 'em
Put the barrel bottle pump, and pumped 'em
And pumped 'em and pumped 'em, and pumped 'em and pumped 'em

[Chorus]

So hurry up and copy and go selling nicks and dimes
Shorty she so fyne, I gotta make her mine
A ass like dat gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em everytime, punch 'em with every nine

They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme
Been on parole since 94 cuz I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did it three ta nine
If D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin dimes

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]
You said you a gangsta
But you neva pop nuttin
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you neva cop nuttin'
You been hustlin a long tyme
And you ain't got nuttin

[Verse 2]
Damn Homie, in highskew you was tha man, homie
What tha fuck happened to you?
I got the sickest vendetta, when it come to the chedda
And if you play wit my paper, you gotta meet my berretta
Now shorty think I'ma sweat her, sippin on amoretta
I'm livin once than deada, I know I can do betta
She look good but I know she after my chedda
She tryna get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gonna let her
Be easy, stop tha bullshit, you get your whole crew wet
We in tha club doin' the same ol' two step
Gorilla unit cuz they say we bugged out
Cuz we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 3]
Me I'm no monsta, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm jus me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no acta
But it's me you see on your TV
Cuz I hustle baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
If you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas sayin they gon merk 50 how?
We ridin 'round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR 15's?
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf beams, huh

[Chorus 2X]
QB NIGGA!!
Who I rep wit
QB NIGGA!! (repeat)

[Lloyd Banks]
Marsh' knows man
Talk tough, 'til you get cuffed and start tellin, damn~!
Everyday I shot a new bitch
And when I'm done with her it'll look like...

[50 Cent]
At first they didn't want me, now they want me
See a nigga gettin paid they wanna push up on me
You should see these hoes chasin a nigga
I have 'em in the hotel tastin a nigga
50 like a lollipop, lick me baby
Then lick Dr. Dre and Shady, OH~!

Yeah!
50 Cent, Lloyd Banks
Tony Yayo, G-Unit!

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
This rap shit plays a major part in my life
So if you jeapordize it I got the right (What?)
To send a motherfucker at you tonight (Uh-huh~!)
G-Unit!!

[Lloyd Banks]
And I ain't stoppin 'til my click poppin, swimmin in barrels of money
Ma can walk around with her head up cause her child ain't a dummy
It's funny - niggaz'd rather see you sufferin and hungry
I'm comfy as hell, skatin with another nigga's money (WOO~!)
You lie your ass off; you know you ain't that tough
I'm pullin your mask off, as soon as you act up (WHAT~!)
You know what I came for, a peace of the game or
Artillery that's 'bout as long as a chainsaw
I buy the weight, but it still feels like I'm dreamin
40 calender, my pillow kinda feelin my semen
The physical pressence of a female's the form of a demon
That's why I, fuck 'em and leave 'em get my nut while I'm breathin (YEAH~!)
If you thought they'd catch me slippin now I'm duckin and drippin
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you grippin
You trippin, no record can get my ass in position
Death wish for no religon whether catholic or christian
Listen; I went through momma bitchin in and out the kitchen
With probable cause as poppa was in and out the prison
We got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours
We got more four-fives and 9's then a deck of cards

[Tony Yayo]
You can take me out the hood, but can't take the hood out me (Cause what?)
Cause I'm ghetto (I'm ghetto)
Niggaz hatin when you do good, but when you broke
Your friends and your enemies they love you (they love you)
Chi-Chi, get the llello (get the llello)
Picture me bein cracked, out of town trips on the train - WHAT~?!
Chi-Chi, get the Yayo
Picture me bein cracked... (TONY YA-YO!!!) here we go
You can sniff me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie
I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin country
Wall Street niggaz, they cop me on a low
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow
It's time to go, on a bus, the train, a plane
I'm smuggle, I'm nuttin but trouble
I'll make your money double, cook me in bakin soda
I'll turn your who-rock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill ya 'fridgerator
Feed your family, turn your man to a hater
You can put me in the door panels or your stash box
Put me in your Nikes, Timbs and Reeboks
If you copped three and a half, you hustlin backwards
Cop a hundred grams, you movin forwards (what?)
I'm tryin to move more birds, in P.A. all day
On the corner of 3rd - nigga what?!

[50 cent)
You can take me out the hood, but can't take the hood out me (WHAT?!)
Cause I'm ghetto (I'm ghetto)

Picture me polishin pistols, I'm comin to get you, the shells hit you
You scream, think I'm playin - I mean it
Man I done brought all these pistols, let's get it poppin
Start to wavin my embroidered shell casings get to droppin
The devil's 'round the corner I got to much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket, just stunt and I'll pop it
I'm dyin to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you numbered for death
As the world turns, the lessons should be learned
Count all my blessings, clean up my weapons, I'm ready for war
The strong survive, the weak shall perish, I told you before
Hoes they compliment me now like 50 - nice chain!
Belagio, twenty grand of chips at the dice game
Ballin out, can't stop it, you gotta watch MTV
BET, nigga you see me~!!
I wonder if you mad, cause I'm doin good
Or cause niggaz feel me, more than you in yo' hood
And it hurts cause you love 'em and they don't love you back
Cause they know you just rappin and you don't bust your gat
You pussy!!

Yeah explain it to the niggaz in your hood nigga
They know you fuckin front nigga
Talk all that gangsta shit on the record; I see you nigga
Niggaz know me nigga; ask around in my hood nigga
Read the "Daily News" nigga you see them talk about me nigga
I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit
You pussy... get it poppin!

{NON-STOP... can't forget... Shady, Aftermath!}

[Young Buck] (chorus)

(chorus)

[Lloyd Banks]
Uhh Yea

But he don't wanna see me in the streets
Niggas get capped up, smacked up and killed
I like to do it gangsta style yea I do it for real
I'll be yo dentist get yo chest filled Wit bullets
Yea yo plan failed to ruin the G-units name
Lets do it like Trina and stop playin' games
I'm a spit heat flashes make you look like a lame
And when I head in the club hoe's give me they name
I'll do it like li'l' flip and say
You a lame so yo dame must be playin mind games
If you think you mess wit G-unit
Think about we go in the streets and handle our business

(chorus)

[Tony Yayo]
I'm back on that gangsta shit
When I'm in the streets y'all know who I'm wit
G-unit we kill niggas that talk shit
The Game has gotten so selfish
We the one's who put him on the map
Take this track rewind it like Boom Boom Clap
And you'll find out who's goin' get ya

I hope you figured out why we made this song
Cuz you really don't want to fuck wit us we King Kong

(chorus to a fade)

[50 Cent]
Yeah, I stay with my ratchet nigga
Go 'head and talk bad nigga
You best be on your best behavior out this motherfucker!
Ha ha

[Chorus: 50 - singing]
I stay gangsta'd up, niggaz ain't got shit on me
Annnnnd, I stay wit my gat, in case I gotta pop somebody
Geeee-Unit clique, you're blind if you can't see
That weeeee run the streets, nigga you better ask somebody

[Tony Yayo]
I got a rifle with a scope in the trunk of the Viper
So I shoot off the roof like the D.C. sniper
I just bought a bezel, and a brand new piece
And a level two vest and a brand new piece
See y'all hip-hop niggaz don't want no beef
Y'all get shot and rat to the hip-hop police
Nigga two guns up, I run up in your label
Why your guns in the house like a couch potato?

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
These hoes want me to stop, but this is the worst part
I was born with this game like birthmarks
I don't trip, but I'ma get a little watch from my modelin chick
Cause she spent a lot of time on my dick
I get a new fan every single time that I spit
Gray & blue Benz, lovin every diamond I get
Fast and fury in the Rang Rove' cause my bread folds
Beef I hit your neck and turn your jewelry into red gold

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I'm from the bottom man niggaz know I came up hard
I got a temper man I'm looking for some shit to start
Man my tax bracket change, I'm sittin on some change
The hoes man they changed they don't treat me the same
It's not my looks that's got me all up in them drawers
It's the new M3 with the Lamborghini doors
Man them D's they done turned them dogs into dopefiends
Smell a leak in my clothes so they barkin at me - WHOA!!

Yeah, that's gon' have to be good enough
I lost a friend tonight
Jam Master Jay... rest in peace
I send my love to his family
50 Cent y'all

[Chorus]

[Outro]
G-Unit, God's Plan!
Damn... {*gunshot*}

[50 Cent]
Hold up
Son them niggaz know who hit that nigga son (I know, I know)
They - how the fuck, we gon' know who hit him, and they don't know who hit him?
The hood talkin man, e'rybody know~! (I know, it's fucked up)

[Intro]
Now I lay thee down to sleep
Niggaz try and lay me down wit heat
And if I should die though before I awake
I pray my Lord my soul to take

[50 Cent]
If dead men could talk in your sleep your homey told you who got him
Would you have the heart to shoot the nigga that shot him? (Huh?)
Or would you start switchin upv
You thinkin 'bout the penitentiary and bitchin up?
What if he said money ain't everything, the hood raised us wrong
All jookz'll get your money long but look here I'm gone
Would that touch your heart? Have you feelin funny inside?
Would that be enough to make your punk-ass ride?
What if he gave you a little list of things to do?
Said he wouldn't have to die, he could live through you
Would you load the gats, and get ready ro ride
Or would you lock the door at yo' crib and hide?
It's a cold world even when it's hot outside
Whether sunshine or rain, you still feel pain
Hit him cause he was your strength, now you in a daze
Your homey turnin over in his grave... cause you PUSSY!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
"Y'all know who killed 'em, filled up" - B.I.G. {*repeat 3X*}
"Y'all know who killed 'em, filled up with the lugers from they Rugers or they Desert"
(RIGHT~!!)

[50 Cent]
Them boys smoked your homey, ye ain't gon' do nuttin back?
Not even if he told you you next to get clapped?
It don't take much for them shells to make the best of you
Your peoples gon' probably cremate and burn the rest of you
You done did too much dirt to try and make it to heaven
Nigga is you down for this 1-8-7?
When you reach the pearly gates, how you gon' explain
You gon' try and tell God you've been framed?
Y'all did everything together, he was your dog
Now you Uptown coppin, and he in the morgue
Them niggaz he gave packs to, they kept the cake
His sister and his baby momma talkin to Jake (uh-huh)
Niggaz that rocked him, they came to the wake
But they ain't come inside, they sat out in the ride
At the funeral, homicide all in the buisness
Walkin 'round askin niggaz to tell 'em who did it
Niggas is throwin blows now you ready to rumble?
Thirsty niggaz are animals, the hood is a jungle
Broke nigga'll body somethin over a bundle
Man a three-year-old kid in my hood know what a gun do

[Chorus] - repeat 'til 15 seconds left

[Outro]
Sha Money, XL!
Shadyville, teamwork, music

50 Cent; Lloyd Banks!

[Intro]
Nobody get hurt if nobody don't move
Just give it up smooth (G-UNIT~!)
Motherfucker you move I'll flash my tool
and blast my tool (G-UNIT~!)
Nigga you don't know me, and I don't know you
You think you know my crew (G-UNIT~!)

[Lloyd Banks]
I been a problem since the old days, pimps and gold caps
Now I'm in O.J. Simpson throwbacks
Y'all was wonderin where my ass been
Probably vacationin on South Beach gettin head like an aspirin
If you gassed, I can let the tec pound your ego
Or lock you in a closet with the West Nile mosquito
The press crowd in people, especially celebrities
I'm heavily shittin on any Tom Dick or Gregory
Nigga you better be strappin; they want you dead if you rappin
I'm tryin to cave your head and your back in
I'm gettin bread and relaxin, and attractin a fan base
of females with e-mails and letters to fax in
In Vegas with a toaster and a blunt
And the hotel I'm checked in, got a rollercoaster in the front
I'ma post 'em when I stunt, the Sammy Sosa of the month
Better yet the whole season, nigga I'm still breathin
Even though my dollars are green
I rap for the kids that's too poor to waste eggs on Halloween
I'm gettin swallowed clean, my habits are good
Collectin all the karats I could
Slidin from a stash spot to conceal the torture
And a good silencer to make it sound like the Wheel of Fortune
All this careless talkin, cause I'm travelin and flossin
Havin a good time, and you havin a abortion
You sucker for love, gettin married and divorced then
can't even afford the batteries for your Walkman
I'm out the hood, burnin Cali weed on Slausson
Where set trippin turn to tragedies and coffins
Look, I mean what I'm sayin, you schemin I'm sprayin
Your team end up layin, on the sofa screamin and prayin
Sayin, G-Unit niggaz be rollin crazy, holdin 80's
Older ladies starin cause they starin in that gold Mercedes
Since 50 hooked up with Shady, now they tryin to book up and pay me
If you think I'm shook up you crazy, baby
The boy strapped two ninas
Smokin out a bag big enough to fit on vacuum cleaners
I wore a glove when I blazed you fatty, I ain't your baby daddy
She flippin, now he tryin to grab me out the navy Caddy
I ain't your ave-y, papa was a rolling stone
Stockin up to own a home, pocket full of loaded chrome
Drop and get a hold of dome, I know your motive homes
You mad, cause I'm fuckin half your Motorola phone
I'm swift with the women I'm good with my words
A lot of, niggaz is hatin on what I deserve I'm hotter
Front if you want, end up on the curb in your Prada
And your mans runnin, ambulance comin
Another day another dollar, on the low from the Impala
I can have a six still in my shower, motherfucker~!

[Outro]
Nobody get hurt if nobody don't move
Just give it up smooth (G-UNIT~!)
Motherfucker you move I'll flash my tool
and blast my tool (G-UNIT~!)
Nigga you don't know me, and I don't know you
You think you know my crew (G-UNIT~!)
I send a nigga that you thought you knew
to come through and put a hole in you (G-UNIT~!)

[50 Cent]
Lloyd Banks, ha ha!
50 Cent! I ain't even gotta work hard
Look at these niggaz, ha ha ha
The fuck you gon' do now nigga!
You done had the same niggaz in the background for a long time
Think they gangster, but goin back and forth to jail
Well jumpin the turnstile don't count nigga
HA HA HA HA~!

[Chorus]
If you think you can fuck with this G
You got to be cra-zeeeee
I won't do a joint wit'chu, no matter how much
your label try an' pay meeeee
I'm on top of hip-hop, I run with Aftermath
and motherfuckin Shadyyyyy
It's simple, I see you'd like to be me
Y'all niggaz, can't fade meeeee

[50 Cent]
I could be a gentleman or gangster, the bitch done chose
Got semi-autos to put holes in, niggaz and hoes
My wrist all froze, for flicks I pose
Fiends sample my D's and those, I suppose that's about a 9
So far the grands stack for niggaz sniffin white lines
Sell anything under the sun to get mines, I'm gon' shine
Stunt for the summer, H2 Hummer, got paper now I'm picky
Change the rims, drape the watch, trade the Timbs, I upgrade
Now I'm paid - catch me in the Trump Tower lobby
Strokin other niggaz hoes is my hobby
Treat me like King Musabi baby, suck me baby
I roll with Shady and Dr. Dre, ohhhh~!
I'm down to, try my luck, see if I can fingerfuck in the truck
G-5, 50 so live
Soon as my zipper go down her eyes wide
Got her in the telly on the bed with her hands tied, wooo!

[Chorus]
If you think you can fuck with 50
You got to be cra-zeeeee
I won't do a joint wit'chu, no matter how much
your label try an' pay meeeee
I'm on top of hip-hop, I run with Aftermath
and motherfuckin Shadyyyyy
It's simple, I see you'd like to be me
Y'all niggaz, can't fade meeeee

  "Is this what you want?"
G-Unit, God's Plan!!

[50 Cent]
G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!
50 Cent nigga, Tony Yayo (yeah)
{WHOOOOOO... KID}

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Yeah! And you don't stop
I do a one-eight-seven on your motherfuckin block
Yeah! And it don't quit
It's G-Unit in your motherfuckin ass bitch~!

[Tony Yayo]
They say good things should happen to those who wait
But I'm stuck in the game still slingin weight
For that eggshell white, that tan and the brown
For a XL-6 or a seven four pound
Suede seats is hot but Italian leather is better
And with cameras in the mirror, nigga cars costs cheddar
I'm on first class flights, with flyin cooks
Cause my verse sound nice when they fly in hooks
Now I'm blowin weed yo, in Beverly Hills
With some bad freak hoes in the Montreal
Next year it's the new Hummer, stash box with the llama
I drive through in the blue data bomber
Heaven or hell'll prevail when I'm a goner
Cause I eat up tracks, like Hannibal and Dahmer
I'm the first one out, and last one on the corner
Cause life is a hustle, any day you be a goner
P89 Ruger, with the silence off
Let off a clip it sound like spitballs goin through straws
We got, plenty of ratchets but not on sale
We even got villagers that hold shotgun shells
These rappers is talkin 'bout bricks in they rhymes
You never did shit but some Mickey Mouse crimes
I don't respect it, my work is never watered down
So on the first I get mo' checks than Nike Town
Sling in thirty-one hundreds, I been on the block
Since niggaz did the snake, running man and the wop
When I was 15, I ain't want no workin papers
I played the strip all night, servin niggaz
Listen nigga, we live like Italians in jail
I got C.O.'s bringin cell phones to my cell
Get rich in the game, niggaz out to get you
Fill your ass up with led turn yo' ass to a pencil
I jumped out with the Ruger rapid-fire
I had you on the run like Omar on "The Wire"
I'm the only rapper you know that stay on the run
I'm the only rapper you know that stay with a gun
I'm a hustler, O.G.'s love to hate
Cause I got old school money put away in the safe
You can catch me in the hood where that dope and coke at
Or you can catch me in cali in the Hollywood throwback
I'm a bail jumper, you know them fish scale pumper
Fuck Judge Wong, he won't catch me on the corner
Nigga pay poor tax, homey you owe me
You wanna rap we can battle for your see through Roley
I be in M mansion, strippin them models
His bathroom's so far you gotta piss in a bottle
There's too many indians and not enough chiefs
Why you buy all the guns if you ain't got enough beef
The shit I spit'll cause an all out riot
And my new four-fifth'll cause a hollow-tip diet
I'm the type to tie up your lady, and gun butt your baby
I'm like the mob nigga, fuck you pay me~!
I'ma hide my assets, and disappear
Make a quick twenty mill' and vanish in thin air
I've finished my work now its time to cop
And meet that Chinese lady at the baggage spot
I need twelve 12's, and fifty-eight 58's
Cause I got eight sales and they all gon' wait motherfucker!

[Chorus]

YEAH~!
{Ha ha... WHOOOOO KID!!}

[50 Cent]
Yeah... 50 Cent, uh-huh
Governor, G-G-G-G-G-Unit~!

She ain't that chick from the burbs that's a stranger to drama
She that Uptown Girl with the cock at the sauna
Went out her way to let her know that I want her
I told her I - know fo' sho' we belong together
And I wouldn't break her heart, my intentions are better
And I, shared the same dreams she had about cheddar
When the D's came she was down to hold the baretta
I got a thing for babygirls, me and her against the world

[Governor - singing]
We used to think the same schemes, with the same dreams in mind
10'll bring you back 20 if the crook is on time
And she knows daddy loves to eat
Take a seat and let my baby rub my feet
She was a clear thinker, with a plan to rule the world
But understandin her place is my girl
Talk about hardcore, to win she'd give her life
Or shoot to kill, to protect this life

[Chorus: Governor]
The world will hear, what's really goin on, in my life - my life
The world will see, what was really down down, in my life - my life
If you only knew, the pain I feel; if you only could feel the streets is real
If they only knewwwwww, what's goin onnnnnnn, yeah~!

[50 Cent]
You're sunshine, your smile make my day
It's simple - your dimple your eyes
Your lips, your thighs, got me hypnotized
Communication's deep, I love it when we talk
Hate it when you leave but when you leave I love to watch you walk
You make a nigga forget about a life full of drama
She got expensive taste, she get it from her momma
Materialistic; still a nigga want her
Consistantly missin her touch when she gone, uhh
She smell like Chanel, she feelin me and I can tell
With the right woman by my side I feel like I can't fail
I've been around been up and down my attitude is fuckin ass
She a rider, I'm in heaven when I'm inside her
Workin up a sweat, kissin on her neck, "12 Play" in the deck
Fo'play correct, have her drippin wet
She looked in my eyes and say she like it but I know she love it
I just keep doin what I'm doin and think nuttin of it

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

{*abruptly ends halfway during the last line of the Chorus*}
"STOP!!"

[50 Cent]
Yeah...
She like it she love it, she kiss it she suck it
She want me to want it, she want to climb up on it
Smile, ha ha... {yeah, Lloyd Banks} (ha ha ha...)
50 Cent (yeah...) {*SHADYVILLE~!*}

[Lloyd Banks]
Mami we can, creep through the ghetto wit'cha, feet in stilletos
Hit the, club and party as long as you sneak in the metal (YEAH~!)
Or we can head to the house, from the house it's the floor
From the, floor to the couch, from the, couch to the door (WOO!)
Then it's, out to the store or, out to the mall
Watchin, out for the law, cause of this pouch full of raw
I don't care how much you love her don't, vouch for the whore
Cause the first chance she get I'm in her mouth on the tour (WHAT?)
I'm lovin the ladies, with no husbands or babies
Since little I've been active, lost dozens of babies (C'MON!)
Gettin a hummer stuntin, in your cousin Mercedes
Or roll up on you dumpin, pourin guns at your 80's (WHAT~?!)
You the man on your block? I'm the talk of the town
That's probably why they wanna see me in chalk in the ground
But you can find me on the corner with a pack of marijuana
Middle finger to haters nigga you fuckin with the greatest

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Yes, I wanna go, to a mo-tel
Just for fo' hours, only short stay
We don't have to go, far far away
To have some fun, try things my way
Bitch grab your bag, get in the Escalade
Put the seat back, we're onnn our way
There's no games to play, nothin else to say
Listen to your man, you'll like things my way

[Lloyd Banks]
You make me wanna, rest in the tower make a, mess in her flowers
How 'bout, sex in the shower or, neck for an hour (AOWWWW~!)
You got a ring on your finger even, one in your nose
Squeezin some on your toes, runnin your tongue like lobes
Ohh remember spin the bottle? You coulda been a model
While you begin to swallow, niggaz in Timbs tomorrow
No love, no hoes, no paper
Nah no ice, no Mo', there's no acre
Your bitch look good I'ma take her
Won't have to fight to make her the first -
{*abruptly ends*}

[Tony Yayo]
Mmm, yeah, uhh
Mind playing tricks on me man

It's a, regular day and a regular routine
'Til I hear this tragic news from about two fiends
Your man 50, just got popped 9 times
And I heard through the grapevines it's all cause he rhymes
In front of his grandma, I'm standin on the lawn
Wearin no Teflon, I wonder if he gone
I know in my heart I wanna cry
Havin thoughts in my mind is my man gon' die?
As I frantically run toward's 50 spot
I panicky peep like fifty cops
It was blue & whites, DT's and homicide
With yellow tape locked off on both sides
With four-fifth shells on the floor
And DT's ringin doorbells, goin door to door
Yo I'm stressed out, smokin bogie after bogie
Duckin the sarge cause the sarge fuckin know me
I jumped in Jeep truck and got a mac to spit
And we did about a buck cause Mary Mack I lit
at the time, I started thinkin back some shit
How we used to sling crack and stack our chips
With Kev, P-Low, Big Jewel the Kid
And my man 50 used to smack a bitch
And the good and the bad on the 1-3-4
And them hoes that we had on the Cash Money tour
Now I'm at the hospital, stop daydreamin
All I see is 5-5-1 and there's beefin
Baby moms is screamin, whole family grievin
But the word is, that my man's still breathin
I dropped to my knees and I thanked the Lord
And got a long shitlist all across the board
Motherf... {*ends*}

I love niggas, I love niggas~!
Cause niggas are meeeee
And I should only love that which is meeeee
I love to see niggas go through changes
I love to see niggas, shoot the shit
But there's one thing about niggas I do not love

[50 Cent]
Yeah... did it again nigga!

[Chorus: Notorious B.I.G.]
To all my Brooklyn	"Niggas!!"
To all my Uptown	"You niggas understand!!"
To all my Bronx		"In this world nigga!!"
To all my Queensbridge	"Swept you away.."

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick
and kicks it quick, you know how black niggaz get
with the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, makin crazy G's
Hittin buckshots at niggaz that open spots
on the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make 'em wet in they pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out

[Chorus: 50 Cent - repeat 2X]
We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel us nigga
Biggie yo' nigga, 50 yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigger, leave a nigga fa' sho'!
We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo' nigga, 50 yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigger, leave a nigga fa' sho'!

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Then we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A., cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North bound first stop, Watertown or Bitch-skill
Where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha hahhh, yo chief, pass the buddha

[Chorus]

[Verse: 50 Cent]
When I was young my M.O. was to go hand-to-hand
Even my P.O. she called me the Ginger Bread Man
I catch a new case, and tell her ass "catch me if you can"
Don't let your people fill you up wit octane, I'm not playing
Get gassed up to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it - thou shalt not fuck wit North C. Papa
50 Cent, I'll break yo ass off propa'
There's no place like home, New York - New York
I run the city, and I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they smacked silly or sprayed wit the Mac Milli
They don't want drama really
Pussy niggaz get hard lip syncin my lyrics like Milli Vanilli
In the hood they feel me {*gun cocked*} hah!! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit
Every bootlegger you know, pump my shit bitch!

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent - singing]
She said she love it, she like my muuuu-sic
She like that I'm thuggin, she loves G-Unit

[50 Cent]
What? Uh-huh; she feelin the kid
Baby girl you can push me, pull me, scratch me, screw me
Holla my name out while we fuckin on top
You can ride like a rodeo, oh you freaky and I know so
I'm with it if you like it in your butt
She's a working girl
Get on top and let me see you work it girl
Don't stop - get it, get it
You can ride 'til you're satisfied
Thought of your lovin in my brain make me sing in the rain
(Peep what she said)

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
She like my music... G-Unit!
WOO~! Yeah... G-Unit {NON-STOP}

[Tony Yayo]
Man anything goes when it comes to hoes
Ma your feet look good, let me suck on them toes
And if your body smell right, let me lick all them holes
I bust a nut in your face and wipe my dick on your clothes
Baby - spark the blunt and light the incense
Now it's time to freak off with my project princess
Y'all groupies wanna talk, and send fanmail
Cause y'all see me in The Source and the XXL (ha ha ha~!)

[50 Cent - singing]
Everybody wants to be real
Still they wanna hide how they feel
Nigga you're supposed to be real
When niggaz find out that you're tellin
Nigga you gonna get yo' cap peeled
Cause they get it, and now you know you gon' it
Truuuuuuuuuuuue, I know true thugs are hard to find
Just let me find you, f'real
I'll put a hole in yo' ass with the blue steel
Keep yo' punk-ass from tellin - HA HA!
Oooooh nigga you, tell on me
And you'll diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeee-hiiiiiiiigh

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]
I hustled then I got that ching ching ching
Then I bought my bling bling bling
That's how I got your fuckin bitch on my dick

[Tony Yayo]
You can catch me run inside nigga, doin my thing
Cause what I write with my pen got me next to Don King
I'm blowin H-2-O, in a H2
With a project chick named Rachel
I got rocks on my neck, with a big-ass piece
And come through in a Lex with Claudette Ortiz
With no roof on the top, that's my Sunday car
In the Hummer lookin hot, that's my Monday car
I got a stable of hoes, now I'm a P-I-M-P
And bring in bitches on a Amtrak with grams of D
We got beams on the gat, we detail our weapons
And the way that I rap, we e-mail addressin
Niggaz hear what I spent, and wonder how I write it
G-Unit gon' win, we on automatic pilot

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
With menage-a-trois' I got these dykes wet
Off of blue E pills with the knife checks
I'm still blowin green in the PJ's
Laid out in the cut readin screenplays, nigga be ea-sy
Don't talk grea-sy, the rap game needs me
I spent 16, you gettin charged by the freebie
Y'all niggaz in court, spillin the beans
About the kid from New York that be killin the fiends
I'm a H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler
I got 2 maids but fuck it I need a butler

[Chorus]

BITCH!!

[Missy]
This is a Missy Elliot one time exclusive (Come on)

[Chorus]
Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it
  {*"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it" - backwards 2X*}
If you got a big [elephant], let me search ya
To find out how hard I gotta work ya
  {*"I put my thing down, flip and reverse it" - backwards 2X*}

[50 Cent] (Missy)
(REMIX) Unh Yeah
Now Missy she too much for me (I'm freaky)
She took me to to the crib man, she told me (eat me)
Now my babymama I told her ass not to beat me
Her broke ass wanna fight, Missy know how to treat me
She sitting on cash, she got money out the ass
Gave her them back shots and got money out her ass
Now you can see me in the coupe like WHAT
Next time I'll hit her in that G5 TRUCK
I've got the magicstick, I can go for hours
From the bed to the floor, to the sink to the shower
With her back to the bed and her legs to the sky
I can go hard, know why, big girls don't cry
I had visions of Missy with her money by the tub
Ching! Ching! Jackpot, I think I'm in love
I'm looking for Missy now so I can get my back rubbed
This the shit she hollered in my ear before we left the club

[Missy]
I'd like to get to know ya, so I can show ya
Put the pussy on ya, like I told ya
Gimme all your numbers so I can phone ya
Your girl acting stank than call me ov-ah
Not on the bed, lay me on your sofa
Call before you come, I need to shave my cho-cha
You do or you don't or you will or you won't cha
Go downtown and eat it like a vul-cha
See my hips and my tips don'tcha
See my ass and my lips don'tcha
Lost a few pounds in my whiffs for ya
This the kinda beat that go wa-ta-ta
Ra-ta-ta-ta, ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
Sex me so good I say blah-blah-blah
Work it! I need a glass of wat-ah
Boy oh boy its good to know ya

[repeat chorus]

[Verse 2]
If you're a fly gyal, get your nails done
Get a pedicure, get your hair did
Boy lift it up, lets make a toast-ah
Lets get drunk, its gon bring us clos-ah
Don't I look like a Halle Berry post-ah?
See dem Belvedere playin tricks on ya
Girlfriend wanna be like me nev-ah
You won't find a bitch that's even bett-ah
I make it hot as Las Vegas weath-ah
Listen up close while I take you backwards
  {*"Watch the way Missy like to take it backwards" - backwards*}
I'm not a prostitute but I can give you whatchu want
I love your braids and your mouth full of funk
Love the way my ass ba-bump ba-bump bump
Keep your eyes on my ba-bump ba-bump bump
And think you can handle this ga-donk ga-donk donk
Take my thong off and my ass go boom
Cut the lights off so you see what I can do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Boys, boys, all type of boys
Black, white, Puerto Rican, Chinese boys
{??} thanga thang, {??} thanga thang
Girls, girls, get that cash
If its 9 to 5 or shakin ya ass
Ain't no shame ladies, do your thang
Just make sure you ahead of tha game

Just cause I got a lot of fame sup-ah
Prince couldn't get me change my name papa
Kunta Kinte, enslave a game, no sir
Picture black sayin, "Oh yessuh massa"
Picture Lil' Kim dating a pastor
Minute man, big men can outlast ya
Who is the best? I don't have to ask ya
When I come out, you won't even matt-ah
Why you act dumb like ughhh, duh
So you act dumb like ughhh, duh
And the drummer boy go pa-rum pa-pum pum
Give ya some some some of this Cinnabon

[Chorus]

To my fellas, ooooh
Good God, I like the way you work that

[50 Cent]
G-Unit (bo!) We in here (bo!)
We can get the drama poppin we don't care (bo! bo! bo!)
It's going down (bo!) Cause I'm around (bo!)
50 Cent, you know how I gets down.. down

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
What up, blood? (What)
What up, cuz? (What)
What up, blood? (What)
What up, gangstaaah?

[Verse One]
They say I walk around like got a 'S' on my chest
Naw, that's a semi-auto, and a vest on my chest
I try not to say nothin the D.A., might want to play in court
But I'll hunt or duck a nigga down like it's sport
Front on me, I'll cut ya, gun-butt ya or bump ya
You gettin money? I can't none with ya then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I.
I'm the type to kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit then they know me
I grew up around some niggaz that's not my homies
Hundred G's I stash it (what) the mack I blast it (yeah)
D's come we dump the diesel and battery acid
This flow's been mastered, the ice I flash it
Chokes me, I'll have your mama pickin out your casket, bastard
I'm on the next level, right lane forget bezzle
Benz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle, blood (what)

[Chorus] - (first time w/o first line)

[Bridge]
We don't play that, we don't play that, we don't play that
(G-Unit) We don't play around

[Verse Twi]
I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder
When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger?
When the fifth kick, duck quick, it sounds like thunder
In December I'll make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine
Any chick I fuck with is a dime
I'm like Patti LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own
Where I lay my hat is my home, I'm a rolling stone
Cross my path I'll crush ya, thinkin I won't touch ya
I'll have your ass usin a wheelchair, cane or crutches
Industry hoe fuckers, in the hood they love us
Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chuckers

[Chorus]

[Bridge] - repeat 4X

Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy, right?
I, I owe you for this one

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waiting for a track to explode on (Yeah!)
You can stunt if you want and ya ass'll get rolled on (It's Fifty!)
If it feels like my flow has been hot for so long (Yeah!)
If you thinking I'm a fuckin fall off ya so wrong (It's Fifty!)

[50 Cent]
I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven
Sittin politic with passengers from nine eleven
The Lord's blessins leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I ain't even got to try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at yo dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
Fifty fear no man, Warrior, swingin swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand writin lines knowin the Source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut wit a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone'll stop ringin again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Eminem]
If ya patiently waitin to make it through all the hatin
Debatin whether or not you can even weather the storm
Unless you lay on the table they operatin to save you
It's like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above

They think they crazy but they ain't crazy, let's face it
Shit basically they just playin sick
They ain't shit, they ain't sayin shit, spray em' fifty
A to the K get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fuckin mayhem, you stayin wit me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose wit this uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the messege? Am I gettin through to you?
You know what's comin, you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix em' up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killas tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put ya life in this, nothin like survivin a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Them cowards fucked wit the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children, its nuclear showers
There's nothin spookier
Ya now about to witness the power of fuckin fifty

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
If the gun spark I'll hear all of the shots go off
It's fifty, they say it's fifty
See a nigga layed out wit his fuckin top blown off
It's fifty, man that wasn't fifty
Don't holla my name

You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw you should watch yo mouth
Cause I'll break yo face
Have yo ass runnin, mumblin to the jake
You goin egainst me dog, you makin a mistake, I'll split ya
Leave ya lookin like the Michael Jackson jackets wit all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper
Yo bitch a regular bitch, you callin her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keeping her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in ninety four, gWe don't love them hoesh
I got pennies for my thoughts now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin lookin mean on the six
Niggas wearin flags cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood, they get filled up wit holes

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Lloyd Banks]
Man we gotta go get something to eat man
I'm hungry as a motherfucker

[50 Cent]
Ay yo man, damn what's taking homie so long son?

[Lloyd Banks]
50, calm down, here he come

[9 Shots]

[Banks and 50]
Ahh, ohh, what the fuck!?

[50 Cent]
Ahh! son, pull up! pull up!

[Intro: 50 Cent - singing]
Many men, wish death upon me
Blood in my eye dawg and I can't see
I'm trying to be what I'm destined to be
And niggaz trying to take my life away
I put a hole in nigga for fucking with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk, when you talk about me
Cause I'll come and take your life away

Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

[Verse One]
Now these pussy niggaz putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt, that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, something special happen every time
I'm the greatest, something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga, go'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

[Chorus - singing]
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me

[Verse Two]
Some days wouldn't be special, if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This if for my niggaz on the block, twisting trees and cigars
For the niggaz on lock, doing life behind bars
I don't see only god can judge me, 'cause I see things clear
Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means, with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggaz ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie?

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Every night I talk to god, but he don't say nothing back
I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggaz keep pulling techs on me
Psych says some bitch dumb, put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much, when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me, Tuck got knocked
I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate nigga? You can't read between the lines
In the bible it says, what goes around, comes around
'Hommo' shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here, for a real reason
Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fucking breathing

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go shawty, it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look mami I got the X if you into takin drugs 
I'm into havin sex, I ain't into makin love 
So come gimme a hug, if you're into gettin rubbed

[Verse One]
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggaz heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes, they wanna fuck 
But homie ain't nuttin changed hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut - hey nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood, in L.A. they sayin "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggaz'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm fully focused man, my money on my mind
Got a mill' out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feelin my style, she feelin my flow
Her girlfriend willin to get bi and they ready to go (o-kay!)

[Chorus]

[Bridge: sing-song]
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things 
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look nigga I done came up, and I ain't changed

[Verse Two]
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toastin to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryin to pull me back right?
When my joint get to pumpin in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin about money homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggaz hate then let 'em hate then watch the money pile up
Or we go upside your head wit a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin be

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither nigga
We in the club all the time nigga, it's about to pop off nigga
G-Unit

(Chorus)
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man I'm on some hood shit

Give me some dro, purple haze, and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man I'm on some hood shit

(Verse 1)
Everytime I ROLL up, niggas holla ROLL up, and I tell'em HOLD up,
You ain't gettin money you ain't smoking
In my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzos, smoking on indo
Hiiigh as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat, only if you got beef
Man you better holla at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Everytime I pop up, a lot going on in my hood

I shoot the dice, I holler get'em girls
Daddy need new shoes
Daddy need Perelli's to look mean on 22s
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny
The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semis
They was just harassing me cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)
But I- twist that la, la, la, la

I get high as I wanna nigga
Go against me, fa sho, you's a goner nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me, tell me you love me, don't stare at me man
I'd hate to be in the Benz clapping one of my fans
Let me show you how to greet me, when you meet me, when you see me
If you real my nigga, you know how to holla "G-Unit!"
There's no competition, it's just me,
50 Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I can go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Now who you know besides me who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffin on white lines
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach them how to buck them 380s and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib, sippin Guinness, watching Menace
Then Oh Lord, have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog
My team they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave nigga, go ahead get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot, so ain't shit you can tell me
Niggas calling me to feature, man fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good
I ain't got to write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood

(Chorus)

G-Unit, are you ready
G-Unit, are you ready
G-Unit, are you ready
Nigga, ready or not, here I come, come, come

(Skit)
"Aye you want some of this shit"
	"Naw, I don't want that shit"
"I don't give a fuck, I don't play dat shit"
"And I'm fin'nin to buss a cap in a nigga"
	"Man SHUT the fuck up"
	"Whoa slow down, slow down, slow down"
	"You see that brick house right there"
	"That's the nigga crib when he come out you gotta tighten his ass up"
	"I'ma get in the other car"
"Aight" {*a car revs up*}
{*gunshots*}

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If there's beef, cock it and dump it, the drama really means nothin
To me I'll ride by and blow ya brains out (brains out)
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you wit them thangs out (thangs out)
I do what I gotta do I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfuckin tape in court
I'll kill you - I ain't playin, hear what I'm sayin, homie I ain't playin
Catch you slippin, I'ma kill you - I ain't playin, hear what I'm sayin, 
homie I ain't playin

[50 Cent]
Keep thinkin I'm candy till ya fuckin skull get popped
And ya brain jump out the top like Jack-in-da-box
In the hood summer time is the killing season
It's hot out this bitch that's a good 'nuff reason
I've seen gangsta's get religious when they start bleedin
Sayin "Lord, Jesus Help Me" cause they ass leakin
When they window roll down and that A.K. come out
You can squeeze ya lil handgun until you run out
And you can run for ya back-up
But them machine gun shells gone tear ya back up
God's on ya side, shit I'm aight wit that
We reload them clips and come right back
It's a fact homie, you go against me ya fucked
I get the drop, if you can duck, ya luckier then Lady Luck
Look nigga, don't think you safe cause you moved out the hood
Cuz ya momma still around dog, and daddy ain't good
If you was smart you'd be shook of me
Cuz I'd get tired of lookin for ya, spray ya momma crib, and let ya ass look 
for me

(Chorus)

[50 Cent]
My heart bleeds for you nigga, I can't wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in ya eyes, I can see the bitch in you
Nigga you know the streets talk
So they'll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind, I'm down to ride till the sun burn out
If I die today, I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts that I've been in I'm by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now, shit changed motherfucker I can hire some help
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter fin'nin to get get shot it won't do 'em no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fuckin hurt when it rain
Oh you a pro at playin battleship well this ain't the same
Lil homie this is a whole different type of war game
See the losers and up in shackles of motherfuckin chains
Or laid out in the streets leakin out they brains

(Chorus)

[50 Cent]
After the fist fights it's gunfire boy you get the best of me (best of me)
If you don't wanna get shot I suggest you don't go testin me (testin me)
All the wrong I've done the Lord still keep on blessin me (blessin me)
Fin'nin to run rap cuz Dr. Dre got the recipe (the recipe, recipe)

Yeah, uh ha, aye Dre
You got me feelin real bulletproof up in this motherfucker
Cuz my windows on my motherfuckin Benz is bulletproof nigga
Cuz my motherfuckin vest is bulletproof nigga
Cuz my motherfuckin hat is bulletproof nigga
But the Doc said if I get hit I might get a fuckin concussion
Better that then a hole in the head right nigga, heh heh ha ha

Yea, ha ha, yea, yea

[Hook: 50 Cent]
If I can't do well, homey, it can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top
Fo sho I'ma make it hot, baby (baby)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I apply pressure to pussies that stuntin I pop
Stand alone squeezin my pistol I'm sure that I gotta
Now Peter Piper picked peppers, and Run rocked rhymes
Now 50 Cent, I write a lil bit but I pop nines
Tell niggaz, "Get they money right," cause I got mine
And I'm around quit playin nigga you can't shine
You gon be that next chump to end up in the trunk
After bein hit by the pump, is that what you want?
Be easy nigga, I lay your ass out
Be-lieve me nigga, thats whut I'm about, gangsta
You could find a nigga sittin on chrome
Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone (Yea!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent] + (Dr. Dre)
I'm down for the action, he smart with his mouth so smack 'em
You holdin a strap, he might come back so clap 'em
React like a gangsta, die like a gangsta for actin
Cuz you'll get hit & homicide'll be askin, "Whut happened?"
OH NO look who crept in with the FO'FO'
20 inch rims sittin on LOW-PRO
Eastside, Westside niggaz ALL KNOW, I'm LO-CO
Even my mama said, "Something really wrong with my brain"
Niggaz dont rob me they know I'm down to die for my chain
G-UNIT! We get it poppin in the hood
G-UNIT! Muthafucka whuts good?
I'm waitin on niggaz to act like they dont know how to act
I had a sip of too much jack, I'll blow 'em off the map
With the mack, thinkin it's all rap
Til that ass get clapped and Doc say "It's a wrap"
(It's a wrap, nigga)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I been feelin I have to teach lessons to slow learners
Go head act up, get smacked in the head with the burner
I dont fight fair, I'm dirty-dirty
I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga ya'heard me?
When streetlights come on niggaz blast the nines
Get locked up, they read books to pass the time
In the game there's up's and down's, so I stay on the grind
Niggaz on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
They aint nothin they could do to stop my shine
This is +God's Plan+ homey, this aint mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma; who always gotta throw her two cents
I'm the drop out who made more more money than these teachers
Roofless/Ruthless like the Coupe but I come with more features
I am whut I am, you could like it or love it
It feels good to pull 50 grand and think nothin of it
Fuck it

[Hook] - repeat 2X

Uh huh, hood make it hot

Come off, now watch your chain
Fo' I blow out your brains
Shells hit your chest go out your back mayn (back mayn)
See me I put in work, man I been doin' dirt
For so long when niggas get laid out (laid out)
Niggas run through my crib, to holla at the kid
That's when I start bringin' them thangs out (thangs out)
Then we go through the strip, hangin' up out the whip
Dumpin' clips off at they whole clique mayn (clique mayn)
When witnesses around, they know how we get down
So when the cops come they ain't see shit mayn (shit mayn)
My soldiers slangin' 'caine, sunny, snow, in sleet or rain
Come through the hood and you can cop that (cop that)
I'm sittin' on some change, G-Unit gots the game
Come through here stuntin' you get popped at (popped at)

[Chorus] 2x
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots but you don't hear me though

[Young Buck]
I came in this game knowin' niggas gon' hate me
Just for the simple fact they know that I'm a rida' (rida')
I got a hell of a aim, I keep on tellin' ya mayn
I swear ain't nobody gon' find ya (find ya)
When I get lifted I'm tempted to tear your block up
Your niggas can't run cause I'm behind ya (behind ya)
Me and Chilly in your city wit' a couple nine-milli's
You better stay in line bro' (in line bro')
Cause if I walk it I'll talk it, you know we'll walk up and pop it
I love the sound of gunfire bro' (gunfire bro')
Right now we smackin' 'em wit' platinum
And they hate it cause we made it, that's what we keep that eye for (that eye for)
I represent it cause I'm in it, UTP until I'm finished
Juvenile, they can't stop us (can't stop us)
And I admit it, I live it
I'll knock a baller off his pivot with this motherfuckin' choppa'

[Chorus] 2x

[50 Cent]
My twenty-inches spinnin', you always see me grinin'
And you hear niggas call me grimey (grimey)
They hit me wit' them bricks, and I ain't pay 'em shit
I'm outta town, they can't find me (find me)
When I come back around, man I'ma back 'em down
I run up bustin' that Tec mayn (Tec mayn)
If you ain't got a gun, and you can't fuckin' run
My advice is you hit the deck mayn (deck mayn)
But if you get away and come back another day
My soldiers'll leave you wet mayn (wet mayn)
Cause we know where you be, and we know where you stay
And we'll come trippin' through your set mayn (set mayn)
Man you heard what I said, now get it in your head
I ain't payin' no fuckin' debt mayn (debt mayn)
Cause you'se a middle man, but you don't understand
You'se a fuckin' fake ass connect' mayn (connect' mayn)

[Chorus] 2x

Yea, G-G-G-G-G-UNIT! (G-UNIT!)
Ha ha...

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely, 50 don't BACK DOWN
Everywhere I go both coasts wit toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that MACK DOWN
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fuckin hold SHAQ DOWN
Next time you in the hood and see an ol G
You ask about me, the young boy don't BACK DOWN

[50 Cent]
Any living thing that cannot co-exist with the kid
Must decease existin, little nigga, now listen
Yo mami, yo papi, that bitch you chasin
Ya little dirty ass kids, I'll fuckin erase them
Your success is not enough, you wanna be hard
Knowin that, you get knocked, you get fucked in the yard
Youza poptart sweetheart, you soft in the middle
I eatcha for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace
and your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his +Knight+ to be Suge
You can buy cars but you can't buy respect in the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectfu cuz to me you're a mystery
I know niggaz from ya hood, you have no history
Never poked nothin, never popped nothin, nigga stop frontin
Jay put you on, X made you hot
Now you run around like you some big shot
Ha, ha pussy...

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
"The rap game is all fucked up now! What are we gonna do now?
How we gonna eat man? 50 back around"
That's Ja's lil punk ass thinkin out loud
Southside, Tah died, that's just how I get down
I'm back in the game shawty, to +Rule+ and conquer
You sing for hoes and sound like the cookie monster
I'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers
All the other hard niggaz, they come from Yonkers
It's been years and you had the same niggaz in the background
You never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah, Crack child
Them niggaz dead, they just SUCK, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say "they like them in the hood"
I'm back better than ever, on top of my game
Even them country boys sayin "50 we feelin you mayn"
Now you stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne
I'm New York City's own...BAD GUY (BAD GUY)

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I ain't tellin anyone you pussy
I ain't tellin anyone you gettin extored
It ain't over.... (G-UNIT)
I've been patently waitin to BLOWW
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the "50 Cent Show"
This is my life, my pain, my night, my gun
Now that I'm back, you can't sleep
I'm a nightmare huuhhhh
You hired cops to hold you down cuz you fear for your life
You heard about them guns I done bought, right?
I ain't goin no where, I done told you nigga
I'ma G-Unit motherfuckin solider nigga (They not gon like you)
I know, I know...ha, ha (G-UNIT)

(Chorus)
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P
(Repeat)

(Verse 1)
Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her cause they wanna
I spit a little G man, and my game got her
A hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
Look baby this is simple, you can't see
You fucking with me, you fucking with a P-I-M-P

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
I'm bout my money you see, girl you can holla at me
If you fucking with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me, if you curious to see
how it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl we could have it all
We could really splurge girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up, if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, BITCH

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holla at a hoe til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless, me I got on gator shoes
I'm shopping for chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper
Man this hoe you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin know
You saying it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch choose with me, I'll have you stripping in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Nik my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your hoe out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six
Hoe make a pimp rich, I ain't paying bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shiiit, TRICK

(Chorus)

Yeah, in Hollywoood they say there's no b'ness like show b'ness
In the hood they say, there's no b'ness like hoe b'ness ya know
They say I talk a lil fast, but if you listen a lil faster
I ain't got to slow down for you to catch up, BITCH

[50 Cent]
(Uh huh) I know you like my style
(Uh huh) You like how I break it down
(Uh huh) I know you like style

Wanna get rich I'll show you how

On ya mark, get set, let's go, switch the flow
Teach ya how to turn yayo in to doe
The original don dada nobody bomb harda
Ya heard what I said boy, I'm hot, I'm hot
The hoodrats they say "He so crazy"
The snitches they say "He tried to spray me"
That's what you get for tryin to play me
The Aftermath and my wrath is so SHADY
No matter how you try you can't stop it
I catch ya stuntin in the Bentley Coup cockpit
If you a pimp why ya hoes stay outta pocket
Front and find out how my P-40 glock hit
[Yayo] "50 you need some help"
Chill Yayo I got this
Where I'm from the D's tryin to knock us
They swear to God that it's me sellin the choppas
Man I ain't give them lil niggas no product

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
(Uh huh) I know you like my style
(Uh huh) But how much do you like my style

[50 Cent]
The birds they say I got a way with words
I be like "baby girl I like them curves"
If ya not busy tonight then we can swerve
I'ma bachelor baby, fuck what you heard

From the tellie in ten minutes I'll make you a believer
Tongue touch ya'll have ya shakin like you havin a seizure
I make hits about what I do in my leisure
G unit gang, can't another clique out to see us
Niggas lip sync the lyrics cuz they wanna be us
Groupie hoes from the hood they be tryin ta G us
Try ta holla at the kid, e'ery time they see us
Girlfriend quit pretending I'm the nigga ya love
And I ain't got to say nuttin you know that I'm thugin
Put my hands on dat ass and ya say that I'm buggin
We family baby, kissin cousins
Now look what the riff raff done drug in
For the cheese my degrees is hotter then ya oven
I'ma New Yorker but I sound southern
And we sip DP till the Don stop bubblin
After we play, ok,  got to ya husband

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

[50 Cent (Tony Yayo)]
Em said you gone like my style
Dre said you gone like my style
I said you gone like my style (Uh huh)
You gone like how I break it down

You're not really, really ready (ready)

You're not really, really ready (ready)
My knife flip open and then I gets to pokin
You're not really, really ready (ready)
Them shells start poppin and bodies get to droppin
You're not really, really ready (ready)
You think ya ready, ya not (ya not)

[Verse 1]
I let my watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me, BOW! What up homie

My whip saying quit playing bitch get in
My earring saying we can hit the mall together
Shorty its only right that we ball together
I'm into bigger things y'all niggaz y'all know my style
Ya wrist bling bling, my shit bling blow
My pinky ring talk it say fifty I'm sick
That's why these niggaz is on my dick
Some hate me, some love my hits

See I'ma lier man I really don't care

You try and play me I'ma blaze it in
My chromes cost more than the crib ya momma raised ya in

[Chorus: repeat 2x]
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper now you can't tell me shit nigga
You can find me in the fo' dot six nigga
In the backseat fondling ya bitch nigga

[Verse 2]
New York niggaz, copy niggaz like it's all good
Fuck around we crip-walking in the wrong hood
I'm fresh up out the slammer, I ain't no fucking bama
I'm from the wild whody, but I know country grammar
See me I get it crunk, niggaz go head and front
I go up out the trunk, come back, rollout I'm done (yeah)
My money come in lumps, my pockets got the mumps
You see me sitting on dubs, that's why you mad chump
Don't make me hit ya up, 50 cent will split ya up
I lay you down, them carnids will come and get ya up
See 50 play fa keeps, and 50 stay wit heat
I can't go commercial, they love me in the street
I'm real bloody man, the hood love me man
Don't make me show up in ya crib like bro-man
Locked up in a pen, I still do my thing
C-O screaming shut the fuck up in the pen

[Chorus] (2x)

I'm in the Benz on Monday, the BM on Tuesday
Range on Wednesday, Thursday I'm in the hooptay
Porsche on Friday, I do things my way
Vipe or Vette, I tear up the highway
Shorty she can tell ya about my dick game
But she don't know me, she only know my nickname
Left the hood and came back, damn shit changed
These young boys, they done got they own work man

[Chorus] (2x)

[50 Cent - singing]
New York City!
You are now rapping... with 50 Cent
You gotta love it...
I just wanna chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe

[Nate Dogg ]
Girl... it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl... it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl...

[50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
would you poof, and disappear, like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap, you chill and drive
I'm askin questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin me?
In the bed if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

[Nate Dogg]
Girl... it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl... it's easy to love me now (Woo!)
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl...

[50 Cent]
Now would you leave me if your father, found out I was thuggin?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin?
Are you mad cause I'm askin you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate?  Cause if so, girl you're a blessin
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
and when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
would you believe me, or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes
To make it up I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I'll say anything to make you smile

[Nate Dogg]
Girl... it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl... it's easy to love me now

Would you still have love for me?
Girl...

Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us

[50 Cent]
I need you to pray for me (and)
I need you to care for me (and)
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading, 'cause I know where I've been

The flow is bone crushin', it's nothin'
I come up with somethin'
Come through your strip, frontin', stuntin'
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinners
Haters hate that I'm winnin'
Man I've been hot from the beginnin'
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm fittin' to catch a felony
Pistol in hand homie, I'm down to get it poppin'
Once I squeeze the first shot (gun shot), you know I ain't stoppin'
Till my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with, or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smokin', still locin',
what nigga, lay your ass down paramedics get you up feeling

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got somethin' for your ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy

[Lloyd Banks]
I done lost my bigger nigga, and I didn't cry
To young to understand, the consequences of a man
Livin' a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas, cause they funny   
20 years, of watching my mama's tears
Got my heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong, cause I need it
These niggas don't want me ballin', they want me buried
Balled in the dirt, from shots flurried
Layin' with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
'Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels, gonna call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flyin'
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm runnin' from nothin', my stomach is touchin', what I'm clutchin' 
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder, so I'm bolder
Hennessey and soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier

[Chorus 2X]

[Eminem]
These are my ideas
This is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my balls, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be
What you see on TV, what you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boopers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags, living fantasies
Frontin' like it's all fun and games, 'til the shoot'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playin'
Ain't sayin' we ain't layin' down at night and ain't prayin'
I bullied my way in this game, man I'm done playin'
Man I'm done sayin' that I'm done playin', I'm a start layin' into these
motherfuckering cocksuckers
There's no way I'm back down, like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man, bowin' to his knees
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whao, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you Marshall
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showin' you fuckin' old farts,
A whole other side, I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fuckin' marshmallow 

[50 Cent]
Unh, yeah..I like the way this feel right here
yo...turn me up in the head phones just a lil' bit
yeah..

[50 Cent + (Lloyd Banks)]
There ain't shit in this world deeper than loyalty and love
(Except loyalty and love, between thugs)
For you, I pull up in the whip and spray the whole strip
(For you, I walk up close and lay a nigga's kid)
For you, there ain't a damn thing that I won't do
I'm a Thug, this my way I show, my love for you
(Nigga for you, I get the coke, I'ma turn it into cash)
For you, if we go broke, we gon' rob a nigga ass
(For you, if we get knocked, I'ma have to take the weight
'Cause with a record like yours dogg, you ain't stayin' upstate)
Nigga for you, I kill a whole God damn crew (Why?)
'Cause I know you'd do the same thing too...haha
I ride, you ride for me, my enemies your enemies
How could you not love a Thug like me?

[Chorus]
Would you ride for me? (you ain't even got to ask)
Would you die for me? (nigga, they blast you, they blast me)
Would you cry for me? (shit, when I die I don't cry for me, just keep reppin' Southside for me)
Nigga, you ride for me? (you ain't even got to ask)
Would you die for me? (nigga, they blast you, they blast me)
Would you cry for me? (shit, when I die I don't cry for me, just keep reppin' Southside for me)

[50 Cent + (Lloyd Banks)]
(Nigga, I'm the stem, you the crack
I'm the clip, you the gat
I'm the glock, you the mac
I'm the artist, you the trap
I'm a pen, you the pad
I'm the Dutch, you the bag
I'm the knife, you the stab
I'm the driver, you the Jag)
I'm the ice, you the bezel
I'm grimy, you ghetto
I'm the bow, you the arrow
I'm the shell, you the barrel
I'm a pimp, you a player
I'm dope, you the hustler
I'm a nine, quiet me down, you the muffler

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]
You can catch me in public housing, wit' bundles of D
Or in the Santa Monica mountains, bundled up to ski 
Since, time is money, I rhyme on the clock
And walk through the strip with a nine in the ox
You seen the ice, you know it's top notch
And when it comes to dice, I'm seeing' shorty to the shot box
Banks stop, guns pop through your tank top
And leave you wet up like a sonar range drop
When I grind, I wear the same thing tomorrow
When you grind, it's Showtime at the Apollo
Damn near every rapper gotta hide sixteen
Well my flow's like a ho that's sixteen
I ran through niggas, dismantled niggas
They mad 'cause they see me in Cancun bitches
But I'm ghetto, straight from the 'hood my nigga
If there's no toothbrush I'ma use my finger
I got so many minks, and so many leathers
The crib is surrounded by animal protesters
I'm a grown man, still livin' like I'm young
With the mind of an old man, full of wisdom
Here the cops come, task force van
Rock so much ice, I'm called Jack Frost man
And while we sippin' on cris', you sippin' backwash man
Your team got heart, but your heart's in my hand
You want sixteen bars, in song format
Or sixteen cars on your mom's doormat...wha

[50 Cent]
Yeah.. 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo
G-UNIT!

[Lloyd Banks]
This rap shit plays a major part of my life
So if you jeapordize it I got the right
To send a mothafucka at you tonight
G-Unit! And I ain't stoppin' to my clique poppin'
Swimmin' in barrels of money
Ma could walk around wit' a head up and challenge you dummy
It's funny, niggaz rather see you sufferin' and hungry
I'm hungry as hell, skatin' with another nigga's money 
You lyin' your ass off, you know you ain't that tough
I'm pullin' your mask off as soon as you act up
You know what I came for, it isn't the game ball
Artillary that's about as long as a chainsaw (Lloyd Banks!)
I'm wide awake but it still feels like I'm dreamin'
Forty cal. under my pillow, condom feelin' my semen
The physical presence of a female, form of a demon
That's why, I fuck 'em and leave 'em
Get my nut while I'm breathin'
'Cause they thought they'd catch me slippin', now I'm duckin' and trippin'
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you rippin'?
You trippin', more records could get my ass in position
Death wish for no religion whether Catholic or Christian
Listen, I went through Mama bitchin' in and out the kitchen
With probable cause, Papa was in and out of prison
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours
We got more four five's and nines than a deck of cards

[Tony Yayo]
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me ('Cause what?)
Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Niggaz hate when you do good
But when you broke, your friends and your enemies
They love you, they love you
"Chi Chi, get the llello"
Picture me being crack, out of town, trips on the trail
"Chi Chi, get the llello"
Picture me being crack (Tony Yayo!)
You can sift me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie
I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin' country
Wallstreet niggaz, they cop me on the low
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow
It's time to go, on the bus, the train, the plane
I'll smuggle, I'm nothin' but trouble
I'll make your money double
Cook me in baking soda
I'll turn your Hooprock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill your 'frigerator
Feed your family, turn your man to a hater
Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox
Put me in your Nik's, Timbs or Reeboks
If you cop three and a half you hustlin' backwards
Cop a hundred grams, you movin' forwards
You tryin' to move more birds
...In PA all day, on the corner of Third

[50 Cent]
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me (what?)
'Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Picture me polishin' pistols, I'm comin' to get you
The shells hit you, you screamin' 
Think I'm playin'? I mean it
Man, I done bought all these pistols
Lets get it poppin'
Start wavin' my emboies shell cases get the droppin' (C'mon)
Like if it's down the corner, I got too much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket just stunnin' I'm stoppin'
I'm dyin' to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you know my contestants
As the world turns, there's lessons to be learned
Count all my blessin's, clean up my weapons
I'm ready for war, the strong survive, the weak will parish
I told you before, hoes they compliment me now like "50 nice chain"
Belagio, twenty grand in chips at a dice game
Burn out, can't stop gotta watch MTV, BET
Nigga you see me!
I wonder if you mad, 'cause I'm doin' good
or 'cause niggaz feelin' me more than you in your own 'hood
And it hurts 'cause you love 'em and they don't love you back
'cause they know you just rappin' and you don't bust a gat
You pussy

Yeah, explain it to niggaz in your hood nigga
They know you fuckin' frontin' nigga
Talkin' like gangstas on a record, I see you nigga
Niggaz know me nigga, ask around in my 'hood nigga
Read the "Daily News" nigga you see them talkin' about me nigga
I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit
Pussy, lets get it poppin'

G-G-Unit, G-G-Unit, G-G-G-Unit, G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit, G-Unit!

[Chorus: Brooklyn]
I still be riding through the 'hood
Brooklyn to Compton, it's all good
From Southside Queens to Inglewood
We representin' like we should

[50 Cent]
I'm hot boy, I told you before
Got that Benz and that Hummer off the showroom floor
I know you hate it when I pop up, wrist all rocked up
In The 'hood, empty niggaz locked up, they rats all knocked up
Baby after baby, the 'hood is crazy
Niggaz'll set you up and wet you up, trust me they shady
Got a pet bulldog, I keep under my linen
It don't bark, they spark when the revolver spinnin'
We winnin'

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Hold up, hold up, get a good look at my rims
God damn, look at them twenty-fours diamonds spin
Now the D's, they harass me in the 'hood
A few times, niggaz try to blast me in the 'hood
Fuck it's all good
Catch me in the coupe - on the lean
Wit' needles and samples and diesels for the fiends
The money stay on my mind, so I stay on the grind
Plus niggaz like to stun, so I stay wit' my nine
I ain't the type nigga that be out, runnin' his mouth
Talkin' gangsta and shit, with my gun in the house
Now homie, you better get to know me better
Before you be leakin' pints of blood into Iceberg sweater
When the tails come flyin' up out the beretta
You gon' feel like it's yo' fault and say "Man I knew better"
Look dogg, I don't play that shit
I pull that thing out I'ma spray that shit
That how I get down

[Brooklyn]
Brooklyn she's so sick in the hood
Got these fat bitches get the spit in the hood
Cause I throw diamonds, shot that fifth in the hood
That's what you get for talkin' all that shit in the hood
Yeah I'm still a minor, remember this
Everything Brooklyn choppy broads still behind ya
Brooklyn to Compton it's all good
Get robbed, get shot, shit is poppin' in the hood

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[50 Cent]
Niggaz screw they face up at me
On some real shit son they don't want beef (nah)
I cock that, aim that shit out the window and spray
There ain't a shell left in my heat
Y'all niggaz better lay down, yeah I mean stay down
You get hit with AK round, your ass ain't gon' make it
You niggaz'll get laid out, your blood and your brains out
Have you on the concrete ship already sinkin
I'm from Southside motherfucker, where them gats explode
If you feel like you're on fire, boy drop and roll
Niggaz'll eat yo' ass up, cause they heart turned cold
Now you can be a victim or you can lock and load
The party jump, shorty bouncin that ass, I want her
Gimme a second I'ma holla I'ma see whassup
I got my razor in my hand, got my pistol in the trunk (uh-huh)
Carve your ass up nice you play me like a punk

[Chorus: 50 Cent singing]
In my hood - niggaz got love for me
But I don't go nowhere without my strap
In my hood - a little 'dro, a little Hennessy
and niggaz just don't know how to act
In my hood - niggaz is gri-mey
I stay on point, I roll with my gat
In my hood - niggaz might buck at me
So I keep somethin around to buck back

[50 Cent]
In my hood... I don't trust a muh'fuckin soul
When the D's come they fold, on my first case they told
Where I'm from it ain't safe to have more than a eighth
Niggaz'll come to your place, put a gun in your face
Tell you open the safe, as your heart start to race
Cause a robbery could turn into a homo' case
Co-operate, or Doc'll have to operate
Niggaz I'll pop you, run a light then pop at Jake
Trust me son, niggaz'll go hard for that cake
These thirsty niggaz are lurkin, you'll have to catch 'em and merk 'em
I'm observin in my hood, cause niggaz be dumbin
Shots forfeit the dice game, all you see is the runnin
They make it harder and harder to pump on the block
I'm a hustler, how the fuck I'm 'sposed to eat when it's hot?

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
In my hood - the house party off the hook until them shots go off
Well that's what you get for stuntin on my block showoff
Up, you shit out of luck if niggaz catch you slippin (uh-huh)
Crack money slow so you know niggaz is trippin (yeah)
Shorty down there on that Queens tracks takin a whippin
Sheeit, bitch get out of pocket, she need some discipline
Peep the fiend shootin diesel in his arm in the alley (ahh)
Look at the chrome spinner spinnin on that black Denali
The grimey niggaz where I'm from don't wanna see you chipped up
You shy nigga on jux, you about to shoot your whip up
It ain't good to do good in my hood
{*click-clack, BLAM*} You know not to do good now

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
In my hood...
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, who's heart's Jello, 'cause

[Chorus 2X]

Shady Aftermath nigga, G-Unit, rap juggernauts of this shit, we takin' over
(Chorus)
I gotta make it to heaven, fuck going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven, gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven, fuck going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven

Some say I'm paranoid I say I'm careful how I choose my friends
I been to ICU once, I ain't going again
First D got murked, then Roy got murked
And homey still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt

I smell somethin' fishy man it might be a rat
Damn niggas switchin sides on niggas just like that
You know me, I stay wit a bitch on her knees and give guns away in the hood
like its government cheese

Spray off Suzuki's eleven hundred cc's
No plate on the back, straight squeezing the Mac
In the hood they identify niggas by they cars
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar

I ain't gotta be around to make shit hot
I send Yayo to dump 30 shots on ya block
So spray dat Tec nigga if I say get it done
An make it wet niggas if you round me son

2 x (chorus)

When I come through the hood, I don't stop to rap ta niggas
Get close enough to smack you then clap you nigga
Pac tried to front so I waved the chrome at his ass
Point blank range I spat and threw a bone at his ass

Two weeks later niggas came through with Mac's to lay me down
They sprayed I played Dead and got the fuck off the ground
Out the blue I get a phone call g50 wadduph
they sent a bitch at me I sent the bitch back cut up

I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you boy
Front on me, you gon meet one of my soldiers boy
Cousin twin shot up his mamma crib now he in Jail
Trippin on Fliks of Blu Cantrell pussy in black tail

Pac mamma moved, but she don't talk to him no more
The shells from twin 4-4's, blew the hinge off her do'
Without that check every month how she gon pay for the crib
Man social service finna come an take dem kids

2 x (chorus)

Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
the courage to change the things I can
the wisdom to know the difference
In AA they make you say that
that's the prayer they burn in your head when you a case act

Man I might talk to you while we up in them pens
but when we come home that don't mean we goin' fuckin' be friends
Shells scratch ya head close enough to hear 'em whistling
Thank god they missed you, an go grab ya pistol

In the hood niggas runnin' round actin' crazy
Buying little air Jordans for maybe babies
See it might be his, and it might be yours
Cause them broads in the projects is straight up whores
Man it don't take much for you to get in them draws
You can have 'em on they back or on all fours

You ain't got to tell me, you feelin' this shit
cause I hear what I'm sayin' I know I'm killin' this shit

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I, don't know what you take me for
I, really don't play that shit
I, ain't got to get you hit
I get out myself and spray that shit

[Verse One]
I got a itchy-itchy trigger finger, nigga it's the killa in me
not to spray this shiiiiiiit
I got enough ammo shots to blow I put a hole
in any motherfucker out this biiiiiiitch
I unload to reload when you get hit I suppose
you gon' be strong enough to take this shiiiiiiit
I'm in the hood ridin 'round with a fo'-fo' pound
Can you see through the limousine tiiiiiiints?
I do dirt, the gat bust, I get to kickin up dust
'fore the Jakes come around here kiiiiiiid
Niggaz get knocked if D's start askin question
My name end up in all types of shiiiiiiit
I'll be a gangsta nigga 'til I die fo' sho'
Whether I'm po' or I'm filthy riiiiiiich
Now what you know about movin that Peruvian flake
for that cake, I get rid of dem briiiiiiicks

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Verse Two]
Now I gotta have shoes, you know chrome 22's
Every time I get a brand new whiiiiiiip
I rode around in the 5 'til my money got right
Then I went back and got that siiiiiiix
I'm in a big white Benz on a hot sunny day
I call it the milktruck an' shiiiiiiit
I'll have your hoe eyeballin at the light damn pimpin
You should take time to check that biiiiiiitch
If I'm ridin through the hood actin like it's all good
but I'm lookin for jux an' shiiiiiiit
In the middle of the night, you can turn on the light
Find me and my niggaz in yo' criiiiiiib
Nigga holla if there's a problem and yo' niggaz got drama
I got burners for sale and shiiiiiiit
Got them macs, got them 9's, got them techs full of dime
Hollow-tips and them extra cliiiiiiips

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Verse Three]
Man I'm tired of tellin niggaz over and over
E'rything about me be gangsta
Man I'm tired of tellin niggaz over and over
I won't hesitate to pop or shank ya
Man I'm tired of tellin niggaz over and over
They can't hustle when I'm in this shit
Man I'm tired of tellin niggaz over and over
You don't listen, you gon' get yo' ass hit

"This is 50"

Yeah!  Nigga cherish me
Like the water you drink
Like the air you breathe
You need me to live
Yeah

[50 Cent]
Ah-ha man!  Ay you know where them niggaz be at right?
{*click-clack*} Take me to 'em

[Chorus: 50 singing]
All through the hood I keep hearin niggaz sayin
- I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggaz done put a hit out and they talkin like the shit okay
- I'm down to ride tonight
We rollin, whip stolen, AK loaded
- I'm down to ride tonight
Weed smokin, straight loc'n, lockin loadin
- Somebody gon' die tonight

[Verse One]
This is nuttin new, I been in this position before
Grandma crib, niggaz outside of her door
Different day same shit, old mac new clip
32 hollow-tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggaz never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin, I'll have 'em tongue-kissin my tec
Gwan come, test me, pussy bwoy, don't try it
Police response never fast enough to shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin with son
'Fore we find out where yo' bitch get her hair and nails done
It's elementary, life is but a dream
You know row row your boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or yo' life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said, "Damn - niggaz wanna stick me for my paper"
"And pray for my downfall," I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that Kevlar and vest shit, that wild wild West shit
There's eighty-one one carat stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make motherfuckers wan' kill me
Every projects in every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, and my mob ain't with me
You can bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin on me'll shorten your lifespan
Hold the mic with my left, my knife in my right hand
YEAH!

[Chorus]

{*sounds of gunshots and people screaming, tires peel out*}

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Clickity-clank, clickity-clank
The money goes into my piggy, bank
Clickity-clank, clickity-clank
The money goes into my piggy, bank

[Verse One]
Man I'll get at you - my knife cuts your skin
I'll get at you - blow shots at your man
I'll get at you - dupe I don't pretend
I'll get at you - I'll put that to an end
That damn shit is old, don't be screamin "Get at Me Dog"
Have you runnin for your life when I match ya part
I get to wavin that semi like it's legal
A lil' nigga hurt his arm, lettin off that Eagle, you know me
Black on black Bentley, big ol' black 9
I'll clap your monkey-ass, yeah black on black crime
Big ol' chrome rims gleam, you know how I shine
C'mon on man, you know how I shine
I'm in the hood, in the drop, Teflon vinyl top
Got a 100 guns a 100 clips, why I don't hear no shots?
That fat nigga thought "Lean Back" was "In Da Club"
My shit sold 11 mill', his shit was a dud
Jada' don't fuck with me, if you wanna eat
Cause I'll do yo' little ass like Jay did Mobb Deep
Yeah homey in New York niggaz like your vocals
But that's only New York, dog yo' ass is local

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah get more money, more money
Yeah - yeah, yeah get more money, more money
Yeah - yeah, yeah get more money, more money
Yeah - yeah, yeah get more money, more money

[Verse Two]
Banks' shit, sells; Buck's shit, sells
Game's shit, sells; I'm rich as - hell
Shyne poppin off his mouth from a cell
He don't want it with me, he in P.C.
I could have a nigga run up on him with a shank
For just a few pennies out my piggy bank
Yayo bring the condoms, I'm in Room 203
Freak bitch look like Kim before the surgery
Send emergency, for Michael Jackson see
You'll picture and say she looks like me
Kelis said her "Milkshake" bring all the boys to the yard
Then Nas went, and tattooed the bitch on his arm
I mean like way out in Cali niggaz know you cuz
First thing they say about you is youse a sucker for love
This is chess not checkers, these are warning shots
After your next move I'll give you what I got
YEAH

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Outro]
When I get at you - I'll punch out your grill
I'll get at you - let off that blue steel
I'll get at you - nigga I'm f'real
I'll get at you - could get yo' ass killed
YEAH!  Yeahhh... hahahaha!
Y'all niggaz gotta do somethin now man
All the shoot 'em up shit y'all be talkin
You gotta do somethin baby!
I mean, I mean c'mon man everybody's listenin
Nigga e'rybody listenin
Hahahahaha!
I know you ain't gon' just let 50 do you like that
I mean damn, rep yo' hood nigga
Nigga you hard right?  Pop off
Yayo, get mobs of them niggaz on the phone
Tell niggaz I said grip up
Niggaz got a green light on these monkeys
Hahahahaha!

[Em] Gee wilikers Gatman they got me surrounded
[50] I'm on my way

[Chorus - 50 Cent & Eminem]
I got a gat man
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a black bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed
They say Batman

[50 Cent]
Robin, Cagney and Lacey, it's 50 Cent and Shady
The worst baby, put your hands on my people I'll react crazy
Put a hole through ya front and ya back maybe
But dude if you try me, I'll have ya ass hooked up to an IV
I'll leave no witnesses when I ride B
You fuck with me, you'll see
I'll react like an animal, I'll tear you apart
If a masterpiece was murder, I'd major in art
Niggaz knew I wasn't wrapped too tight from start
But bein' a little off, landed me on top of the charts (whoo)
So you take the good with the bad, I guess
Level three Teflon plate on my chest
And my cock back hollow tip in the chamber
Danger, anger will change ya
And make ya aim that and squeeze

[Chorus 50 Cent & Eminem]
I got a gat man
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man

[Eminem]
Motherfucker, you retarded you touch 50
I'll leave you dead, leave you dearly departed
We're walkin' away from a beef, in which clearly you started
I said we're walkin' away, did you hear me you wanna be thankful
That we ain't beefin' we're still breathin' and just leave it at THAT
Cause if me and 50 and G-Unit hop back in that BAT mobile
It ain't gonna be no more rappin', it's gonna be BRAAAAT [gunshot sound]
Retaliation will be like them muslim Shi'ite ATTACKS
Some where along the line, its like me and 50 made a PACT
He's got my back, I got his, back
It's almost like we're kinda like Siamese twins
Cause when we beef we pull each other in
to the bullshit like we're conjoined at the hip
It's just unavoidable some of this shit is washable
And some shit will never boil up
And some of it will just simmer at best
If left alone, we'll let it be so there won't be no sit downs
With no Ray Benzinos, there will no peace discussions with me
There ain't gon' be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fuckin' with me and I'll gladly quit fuckin' with you
Just spit ya sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through
Without mentionin me and the machine or Jimmy Iovine and Dre and 50
or D-Twizzie, Obie and just let it be or we'll be back with a

[Chorus - 50 Cent & Eminem]
I got a gat man
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed

[Verse 3 - 50 Cent]
Nigga you get it twisted, you can get ya wig splitted
I don't give a fuck, I don't care if police know I did it
Man I hustle, I get money, in the sunshine or a blizzard
I go hard for that paper, homie I just gotta get it
Got a money scheme, I'm plottin' in the county and I'm with it
You cross me and you gon' make a cemetery visit
That's gangsta, you know me I told it, cause I live it
Shell cases drop, when that chopper chop
Way up the block, get hit with copper tops
When drama pop, the llama pop
And it won't stop, you can run, call the cops
They say no, nigga's know how I be on it
That shit you got, put my pistol to you I want it
Its not a game, perfect aim you feel the flame
Up against ya brain, man it's so hot I'll make ya wish it rained

[Chorus - 50 Cent & Eminem]
I got a gat man
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed

[Intro - 50 Cent]
Yeah
Uh huh
So seductive
 
[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead girl, don't you stop
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Chorus - Olivia (50 Cent)]
I'll take you to the candy shop (yea)
Boy, wanna taste what I got (uh huh)
I'll have you spending all you got (c'mon)
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Verse - 50 Cent]
You could have it your way
How do you want it?
You gonna back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature rising, ok
Let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a tea kettle
I break it down for you now, baby it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teaching you about how strong I got you
When you show me what you working baby, No problem
Get on top, get your bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet, when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm trying to explain baby, the best way I can
I melt in your mouth girl, not in your hand (uh huh)
 
[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead girl, don't you stop
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Chorus - Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, wanna taste what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Bridge - 50 Cent (Olivia)]
Girl what we do (what we do)
And where we do (and where we do)
The things we do (things we do)
Are just between me and you, yea (oh yeah, yea)
 
[Verse - 50 Cent]
Give it to me baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
Cuz I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door, she kept pulling on my zipper
It's like a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs
Had me thinking about that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow mo on the floor when we grind
No she ain't stopping homie and I ain't stopping
Dripping wet with sweat, man it's on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gonna sip that heavy bubble man, every bottle is gone
 
[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead girl, don't you stop
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Chorus - Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, wanna taste what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Chorus - 50 Cent]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead girl, don't you stop
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa
 
[Chorus - Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, wanna taste what I got
I'll have you spending all you got
Keep going til you hit the spot, whoaa

[50 Cent]
Yeah, Shady, Aftermath

Every-body's - on the floor
Goin goin outta control
Set it off on yo' left, dog
Set it off on yo' right, dog
Set it off
Nigga I said set it off! (Set-set-set set it off)

[50 Cent]
Ha ha...
Sick with it, boy better get with it, what?
In the club I get it goin, goin, uh
Just movin to the music it's on
And the sounds of 50 and D-R-E
Everything's calculated and sound precise
Another move another mill', let's get right aight?
Success is my drug of choice, I'm high off life
Feelin lucky enough to bet it all on the dice
Shorty do what you wanna do, hit the dancefloor
And move how you wanna move, later on
we can cruise if you wanna cruise, it's whatever you want
The fact is I got more than I flaunt, yeah

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I do my thang, in the club
Every chance I get, I tear it up
Dancefloor jampacked, look
I got 'em goin goin outta control
Set it off on yo' left, dog
Set it off on yo' right, dog
Set it off
Nigga I said set it off! (Set-set-set set it off)

[50 Cent]
System thumpin, dancefloor jumpin
We 30 deep in this bitch, we stuntin
That's what you get, you in my hood
"I thought you understood" - you know me
V.I.P., no ID
Bottles of DP, I do it real B-I-G
Bitches break their neck to be where I be
Take 'em to ecstasy, without ecstasy
I'm a chef you need the hit I got the recipe
Doc got the antidote, it's in the drugs and the notes
Can you feel it?  Em said for me to make you feel it
And remind you that you rockin with the realest

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I'm hot boy, I'm burnin up
I do my thang in the club with the burner tucked
'Til the speakers all blown, we gon' turn it up
And do that damn thang, yeah do that mayne
Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
Get to poppin and shakin that thing on the flo'
A little dose of it, now I want some more
Nobody put that thang on me like that before
I be a fiend for it, it's the way you move
But I ain't payin for it, cause I ain't no fool
If you okay with it, tonight I stay with it
Hit the telly play with it in a major way get it

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Uhhhhh
Yeah
Uhhhhh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm a straight guerilla with it, cold hearted killa wit it
Any nigga gettin' outta line can get it
I make it hot, motherfuckers freeze up when I come through
Mac-10, thirty two shot clip in my snorkel
I might smile and say whats up but I don't fuck with you niggaz
My rap money slow up, I'll run up on you niggaz
I'm on the edge, I'm just waitin' on a nigga to push me
Put my hand on my strap, what you lookin' at pussy
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
So much chrome on my Benz, you see ya face in my rims
If your bitch wanna roll, I'ma let her get in
I don't play but I'm a playa till the motherfuckin' end {*gunshots*}

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I got no pickup lines
I stay on the grind
I tell the hoes all the time
Bitch get in my car (Bitch get in)
I got my 64, ridin' on Dayton spokes
And when I open that do'
Bitch get in my car

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me you don't know that, uhh I'm the shyiiit
Now you better watch ya girl mayn, I leave with ya bitch
I ain't ?? these hoes, man I'm bout my paper
If your bitch really bout it nigga I'm gon' take her
Backseat of my jeep, fuck till I fuck up her make up
Take her to the Diamond District, introduce her to Jacob
Tell her if she like me she should keep me icey
My game fuck with a bitch brain till she think she wifey
Spent a life savings in a day, cause she likes me
Committment for me, uhh nah not likely
One hour, Vivica, I thought I was onto somethin'
But then the next week, nah man it was nothin' {*gunshots*}

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Look into the windows of my soul, the eyes never lie
They blood shot red, its gaunja in my system, I'm high
First its pain when you lust for love, then its smooth and calm
Feel the rush, like a needles in your arm
Its a cold world baby girl, lovin' me is not enough
Find out when you fuckin' broke, love won't get you on the bus
Man you should see the pretty bitches that be sexin' me
They suck cock that make 'em hot, I just let 'em stand next to me
Hundred percent thug, freak too, I'll taste your love
69's the position, your mouths full baby huhhhh?
My conversations so deep, I get in your head
Next thing you know, you yawnin', turnin' over and I'm in the bed {*gunshots8}

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Hahaha
Quit playin' bitch get it
You know you wanna ride with a nigga
50 Cent
G-G-G-G-G-Unit
{*gunshots*}

[50 Cent]
Yeah, I'm tryin to catch me somethin
A little jux or somethin

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Nigga that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, move I'll break you off properly
I get mine the fast way, the ski mask way
Make money, make money money money
Nigga if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money money money

[Verse One]
You wan' spray at me go 'head; the last nigga that tried
got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Your lil' sister callin me stupid, reason why
her and your momma in the living room now hogtied
I came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait
Got a brand new cig in that ol' 38
I be schemin to put a lil' bread on my plate
Watch and dressers, look through a hole in the cake
I stick a nigga for his sign, sell him back the next day
You thought I really wanted your pussy?  Bitch please
This is stashhouse, jackpot, there go them ki's
My black G-Unit hoodie just wreak with marijuana
Cocaine comin out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious man, I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career
Make money, take money, yeah nigga, YEAH

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Who's that peepin in my window - WOW, the feds on me now
They know when I'm sleepin, they know when I'm wake
I know they got my phone tapper, I'm screamin fuck Jake
I'm tryin to stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad News, VA - now that sounds great
I see niggaz with that ice on, rims shined up
This town's one big pussy, waitin to get fucked
I holla at AI peoples to get gats
They charge me 500 apiece for two macs
Then I'm back doin me, I'm back out on the spree
Catch me a nigga slippin out pumpin that D
Get me a little crew I'll have 'em pumpin for me
The more product I take the more paper we see
Change my name, in NY they don't know where I be
Yeah a nigga doin dirt but a nigga low-key

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
She loves me, she loves me not (yeah)
She loves me not

The fiends need me
I aint around, they bones ache
Detox, rehab, cold sweats, watch them shake
I'm not that genie in a bottle, I'm in a bag
Take one hit and slide off to the Land of H man
When we first met, I thought you never doubt me
Now you tryin' to leave me, you never live without me
Girl I'm missing you, come and see me soon
Tie your arm up; put that lighter under that spoon
Now put that needle to ya arm princess
Stick it in, relapse
I'm back bitch, don't ever try that again
All the shit I did for you, I made you feel good
We have a love thing, you treatin' this like it's just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart you dirty bitch
I won't forget what you did
If you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids
Listen I don't give a damn if your ass starts smokin'
But we have a bond that is not to be broken

[Chorus: repeat 2X] 
We got a love thing
Girl you tried to leave me but you need me
Can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing
I can take ya higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be

[50 Cent]
Baby you know, on the low, ya sister been eyein' me
I'm good lookin', so you know so she be tryin' me
Heard she bi-sexual, she fuck what that girl
But boy oh boy, fuckin' wit me is a whole 'nother world
After that first night she fall in love, then chase the feelin
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote Sexual Healing
Kurt Cobain, we were good friends, Ozzy Osbourne too
I be with rock stars, see you lucky I'm fuckin' with you
I chilled with Frankie Lymon and Jimi Hendrix crew
See this is new to you, but to me this aint new
I live the lavish life
Listen if the mood is right
Me you and ya sister can do the do tonight
I never steer you wrong, if you hyper I make you calm
I'll be your incentive and your reason to make you move on
Let's make a date, promise you'll come to see me
Even if it means you have to sell ya mama's TV
I love you, love me back
No one said lovin' me be easy

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I love you
I gotchu' bad footed on glass
Chasin a dove
That monkey on ya back symbolizes my love
Your friends talk bad about me, bitch
You sit there and listen to them
Over and over you hurt me
My love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up
When you down, then they got nothin' to say
But when you call up, I come runnin' 
I always take the pain away
They set you up to let you down
You crowned, you prom queen
They know bout me behind your back
Call you a fuckin' fiend
We just need to be alone so I can kiss and hug you
Push me inside you 
No other man can love you like I do
Call me daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean real good
I find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should
It was written long before us, it was carved in a tree
Forever me and you baby, we were meant to be
There's more to life than laughter, what brought us together was fate
But we'll be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates
I'ma see to that, I'ma do whatever it takes

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Yeah, yeah we can ride to this
Just lay back, and cruise

Here's a taste of my life, it's bitter and sweet
I pour my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street
Put my Teflon on, and roll with my heat
I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggaz
In the race for the cheese I run laps around niggaz
Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds
Sooner as my sneaker wear in stores, Reebok stock soared
I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggaz could tell
A East coast crib the size of a small hotel
The shit journalists, write about me leave me confused
Have me feelin like the heavyweight champ when he lose
I read somewhere, I'm homophobic - sheeit
Go through the hood, there's mad niggaz on my dick
Now we can get hostile, or we can this smooth
TNT around, I can still make blow move

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are ridin to it - c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music - let's go, let's go

[50 Cent]
Last year I woke up with good luck, damn it feels good
On the low, I done fucked like half of Hollywood
Had yo' favorite actress, from yo' favorite shows
In my favorite position, you know how it goes
And my Bentley bumpin Prince shit, this is "When Doves Cry"
This is what it sounds like when hollow-tip slugs fly
Homey this is somethin you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, cause niggaz will ride and smoke you
Jealousy's for women but some niggaz is bitch made
They make you wanna run across they head with a switchblade
They point the finger at me, sayin I'm bugged
My flow's crack, you listen?  Your fuckin brain's on drugs
Look ice drippin on my neck, hands grippin on a tec
Fool trippin threw a set, you can get yo' ass wet
Cards messin up my deck, screws loose show respect
You try to come at me kid yo' ass better come correct

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
My momma gave birth to a winner, I gotta win
Pray the Lord forgive me for my sins (uh-huh) I'm still thuggin
Cruisin, rims gleamin like the stones on my wrist
Zonin, guess this is how it feels to be rich
Homey, you all front backwards if you chasin a bitch
Stupid - chase the paper they come with the shit
I'm fallin, in love with success
Entrepeneur, conniseur, I maneuver the best
Rollin, Ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle
Stunner have your homies burnin rest in peace candles
As wise men speak I listen and learn
A man dies, a baby's born, my nigga the world turns
Rappers I make 'em sick, when I say I'm the shit
They mistake my confidence for arrogance, they hate on the kid
In 99 I had a vision and made a decision
Bein broke is against my religion, now I'm caked up - what?

[Chorus] - to fade

[Chorus - repeat 2x]
Lil mama, show me how you move it
Better yet, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it
Shake - sh-sh-shake that ass girl!

[Verse]
Go, go, go, 50 in the house
Bounce, y'all already know what I'm about
The flow sound sick over Dre drums nigga
I ain't stupid, I see Doc then my doe come quicker, whoa!
Shorty hips is hypnotic, she moves it so erotic
Girl watch, I'm like bounce that ass girl
I get it crunk in here, I make it jump in here
Front in here we'll thump in here ohh!!
So gutter, so ghetto, so hood
So gully, so grimey, what's good
Outside the Benz on dubs, I'm in the club wit the snub
Don't start nothing, there won't be nothing, uhh!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let's party! Everybody stand up
Everybody put your hands up
Let's party! Everybody bounce wit me
Some champagne and burn a little greenery

[Verse]
It's hot! Disco inferno!
Let's go! You're now rocking wit a pro
I get dough to flip dough, to get more fa sho'
Get my drink on, then get on the dance floor
Look homie I don't dance, all I do it this
It's the same two step wit a lil twist
Listen punk I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Pay attention boy I'll teach you how to do this shit
You mix a little Goose wit a little Dom Perignon
And a little Hennessy, you know we fin' to carry on
I'm hollering at these shorties in the club trying to get right
We gon be up in this bitch till we break daylight

[Chorus]

[Verse]
You see me shining, lit up wit diamonds
Cause I stay grindin, uh huh!
Homie you can catch me swooping
Bentley Coupe and switching lanes, haha!
If you see me rolling, you know I'm holding
I'm bout my paper, yeah!
Nigga I'm serious, I ain't playing
I'll embed it in your brain, I'm off the chain, G Unit!!
Next level now, turn it up a notch
Em and Dre sent me to tear up the spot
Front on me, oh no, you know I'm loco
Hands up on the dance floor, okay let's go

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Yeah, Sha-dy, Aftermath - G-Unit!

[Intro]
Damn baby all I need is a lil' bit
A lil' bit of this, a lil' bit of that
Get it crackin in the club when you hear the shit
Drop it like it's hot, get to whippin that back
Girl shake that thing, yeah work that thing
Let me see it go up, and, down
Rotate that thang, I wanna touch that thang
When you make it go round and round

[50 Cent]
I step up in the club I'm like "Who you wit?"
G-Unit in the house, yeah that's my click
Yeah I'm young but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up boy, I done warned you
Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch
I ain't tryin to beef, I'm tryin to get my drink on
And my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'ma kick it at the bar 'til it's time to go
Then I'ma get in shorty ear and I'ma let her know

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin and touchin a lil' bit
Get to lickin and {fuckin} a lil' bit

[50 Cent]
This is 50, comin out your ster-e-o
It's hard to tell though cause I switched the flow
Eyes a little low cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get, your bitch, she on me dawg
She must, ta heard, about the dough
Now Captain c'mon and Save-a-Hoe
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
#1 on the chart all the time mayne
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man
She backed it up on me I'm like ohh man
I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin, party jumpin, I said loud and clear

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Baby you got me feelin right, you heard me?
My momma gone you can spend the night, you heard me?
I ain't playin I'm tryin to {fuck} tonight, you heard me?
Clothes off, face down, ass up, c'mon, ha ha

[Chorus] - 2X

[Chorus - 2X]
Y'all niggaz know (wut wut y'all niggaz know what I'm about)
Y'all niggaz know, find me at my do' when the guns come out

[Verse 1]
I do this all the time, stuck with a little shine
Walk with a little nine, case I get in a bind
They say I'm fuckin' crazy, they think I'm out my mind
Cause I'm down to bust a nigga head all the time
Now you know the hoes, they know how I roll
In that new Rolls with the suicide doors
22 inch chrome, a nigga money low
You try to touch me, I put out ya get ya brains blown
You go against the grain, pussy and you on ya own
You right there in my zone, welcome to the terridome
The ice blowin' my chain, blood blow in my veins
Blue still in the range, I'm doin' my thang
The semi auto spray, run if you get away
I'll find your whereabouts and clap at you another day
nigga play with the bread, get a hole in ya head
You touch a dime of mine thug and your ass dead

[Chorus - 2X]
Y'all niggaz know (wut wut y'all niggaz know what I'm about)
Y'all niggaz know, find me at my do' when the guns come out

[Verse 2]
In the hood, hoopty, hate low, niggaz don't know I'm around
Hop out, hit 'em up, lay my murder game down
You see me in ya projects, 187's in progress
Hard niggaz finna' soften up when that lead touch 'em
You cut 'em once and keep fight, fuck it just keep cuttin' em
Its real killa instinct, kill or be killed
Trust me, you don't wanna feel how hollow tips feel
Fuck around and get ya cap peeled
nigga you know the drill, Brownsville
Flat bush, ground heights, Brooklyn Zoo
Feed the wolves, they eat the food
And they ?? fathom too
nigga welcome to the jungle, New York New York
Gangstas who sign language actually let their guns talk
Look homie, I'm cool with some bloods, I'm cool with some crips
I'm cool but if there's a problem, nigga I got extra clips
I don't know karate, but I split the bricks
I don't love 'em loverboy, we the shit bitch

[Chorus - 2X]
Y'all niggaz know (wut wut y'all niggaz know what I'm about)
Y'all niggaz know, find me at my do' when the guns come out

[Verse 3]
I'll come through and touch ya, walk out then cut ya
In case your dumbass wanna tussle
AR-15, cooling system makes the shell case muffled
Scope, infra-red, run you're still dead
Hit your calf, hit your ass, hit ya back, then your head
Contract killa, murder for the scrilla
Search, find a nigga, run up behind a nigga
Shoot car windows out to flatline a nigga
Gun pop, heart stop, homie this is heavy
You on your way to meet your maker, nigga are you ready
No exception to the rule, death is promised
Plus I just bought my niggaz new macs and llamas
Got respect for you, ?? I will commodate you
One phone call and niggaz will exterminate you
No future fuckin' with me, there's no tomorrow
niggaz'll run up on you tonight and hit ya the hardest

[Chorus - 2X]
Y'all niggaz know (wut wut y'all niggaz know what I'm about)
Y'all niggaz know, find me at my do' when the guns come out

[50 Cent]
You ready? Okay let me wind you up
Do it exactly the way I said do it man
These niggaz is pussy you heard me?
Get up nice and close

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I put that battery in his back, I'm the reason why he move like that
That's my muh'fuckin toy soldier
I tell him pop that gat, he gon' pop that gat
You don't wanna play with my toy soldier
I say it's on then it's on until your life is over
Fuckin with my toy soldier
If youse a casualty of war, trust me I got more
You don't want it with my toy soldiers

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
Listen up close now, follow instructions
Catch a nigga slippin, run up on him and buck him
I ain't got no conscience no morals or nothin
They ain't wit us, they against us, we supposed to touch 'em
Here's what to do if you see him approach me
Pop that nigga, I don't care if he know me
Half the niggaz hatin on me used to be homies
I don't trust 'em when they smile or when they frown cause they phony
Everytime I come around they call the police on me
That's why the D's in the precinct know me
They know about my rap sheet, they know 'bout how I clap heat
Run like I'm in a track meet, swift with the mac, B
You can see the envy in they eyes fo' sho' mayn
Mad as a motherfucker that I'm holdin
See me in the back of the Phantom, rollin
Quick to make examples out of niggaz fo' sho' man, hold me down

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Shoot, stab, kill muh'fucker
If you ain't 'bout it I don't want you around, cocksucker
Every word out my mouth is felt; that oo-wop pop
Them hollows so hot, yo' ass'll melt
Barber razor in the club, stunt - I'll give you a shape up
Have your ass stitched, gored, your head all taped up
Niggaz know how I get down, see they know when I'm around
Ha ha, my soldiers around
And if some shit goes down - and a nigga get laid down
It's no surprise cause niggaz know how we get down
Black tints on the Testarossa, hammer out the holster
Gat in my lap in case you gotta get clapped
You monkey niggaz swing through my hood, we on that Gorilla shit
You clap off and miss, we come back, start killin shit
Catch us on the corner wearin black chinchilla shit
We organized, disciplined, plus we militant

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Two windows to a man's soul
... fill you with holes
Listen homey.. I'm the man for the job
So if he ain't.. (Yayo, c'mon!)

[Verse Three: Tony Yayo]
I'm in that two-door Phantom and the body's kitted
Waves in my head lookin like tsunami hit it
Niggaz scheme, but the infrared beam's on the mack
I'll put green on yo' head like an Oakland A's hat
One boy was a doja, now he a soldier
My little son Dula lettin off the Ruger
In a whip masked up, lookin for his enemies
Ridin gassed up, off double D batteries
His last casualties, is hooked to them IV's
(50 gimme the word) that's when I squeeze (yeah!)
Click-clack, take that, fall back
It's a contract, 50 grand, I'm 50 man

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Yeah!  This is the general speakin (yeah)
When I say move (ha ha ha) nigga you better move
Soldier, ha ha
I don't want nobody talkin to none of my niggaz
Come around here with that bullshit
Tryin to feed niggaz bad information and shit
That's how my toys malfunction

[Intro]
Ha ha ha!  I told niggaz not to shoot dice with me
Look at this stack, I got money, I got money!!
Ha ha ha..

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Ahh nigga don't trip, I'll kill you if you fuck with my grip
I won't hesitate to let off a clip
Ahh nigga don't trip, you gon' make me get on some shit
Run up on you quick, wet up your whip
Ahh nigga don't trip, you gon' get your monkey-ass hit
Runnin your lip, tryin to fuck with my clique
Ahh nigga don't trip, in case you didn't know who this is
It's 50 Cent bitch, G-Unit
Ahh nigga don't trip

[50 Cent]
I come through your hood, stuntin in my yellow Lamb'
Murcielago, top down, nigga damn
I'm the biggest crook from New York since Son of Sam
Cruisin, bumpin Buck's shit, Ruger in my hand
Thinkin the East ain't enough, it's time to expand
I plan to head out West and plant my feet down
A nigga big as King-Kong in the street now
I do a little house shoppin, and buy me a crib
It's palm trees and pretty bitches out in Cali kid
I touch the Hollywood paper, go and shoot me some flicks
Have some supermodel bitches come and suck on some dick
Mama'll turn in her grave if I married a white chick
But baby'll suck the chrome off a Chevy an' shit
Niggaz be wearin fake shines, I'm rockin a lil' charm
30 carats on the pinky, kiss the ring on the Don
Crack open that Cali bud, stuff the weed in the palm

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
And if you hustle, for me I'll hustle harder
I got what you need, them trees that hard that powder
My niggaz move G-packs, every hour on the hour
They shoot when I say shoot, so I'm in a position of power
You fuck around if you wanna

[50 Cent]
Where I'm from you learn to blend in or get touched
I don't need niggaz for support, I don't walk with a crutch
Niggaz know my steez, they don't fuck with me son
You got a appetite for hollow-tips, I feed you my gun
This is Ferrari F-50 shit, it's real laid back
Type shit you recline to in the Maybachs
I got two shooters now on the run from the fuzz
You get the same shit for 10 bodies you get from one cuz
I live life in the fast lane; hundred miles an hour
Chrome and some woodgrain
You know a nigga still really tryin to move 'caine
Make a little extra money on the side mayne, I ain't playin
I'm up early with the bird's word, puttin that work in
Pirellis on the Porsche chirpin, I'm makin moves
I got a hundred mill' from music, a hundred grand from crack
I'm goin to see my jeweler so I can blow a stack

[Chorus]

[Jamie Foxx ? singing]
La la lahh, la la la la la la la lahh

[50 Cent ? talking]
Yeah, uh huh, I like how the way that feel

[Chorus ? 50 Cent]
I'll build you, but if ever I fall down
And I need you to pick me up
Promise me, you'll be around
Hold me down, I'll build you up

[50 Cent ? Verse 1]
Listen, if you let me, I'll be the reason you shine
It's the secret, I want the world to know that your mine
But on some real shit, communications could be better
So I'm writing this song instead of a love letter
They gon' play it on the radio a hundred times a day
I figure when you hear it you gon' stop and think of me
I wanna get to know you, and be the reason you smile
Girl you know where I'm from, you know how I get down
When times get tough, tell me that I'm special
Not rap, I mean me, that I'm special
You know they say diamonds are a girl's best friend
Precious stones, could you put me before them?
If so, I'll see to it they always around
Nothing but the best, now how does that sound?
If I drop a jewel when we talk you can keep it
Girl you on my mind all the time, that's a secret (shhhc)

[Jamie Foxx ? Chorus]
Baby I build you up
Girl, if I, never show, I'd have you by my side
Oooohhhooohhh yeah
I'd build you up
Girl I, need to know for sure you're mine
I need to know for sure, right now
Girl, if I, never show, I'd have you by my side
I'd build you up
Girl I, need to know for sure you're mine

[50 Cent ? Verse 2]
I thinkin' 'bout you thinkin' that you feel the same way
Or is it just my imagination that get runnin' away?
If you ready to ride, girl, c'mon, let's roll
G-5-5 fly, ma, let's go
It's hard to measure the pleasure of havin' you in my presence
You're smile makes me smile, I'll show you my style
You can shop a little bit, I'll pick out some shit
One pair at a time 'til your shoe game sick
Now who knows what the future holds we'll be together probably
For, better or worse, like Whitney & Bobby
If you wanna play house, we can play house then
But wait, why pretend when you can move in?
Before I be your buddy in bed let me be your best friend
Girl, it's more than lust, I want your trust
You keep it real with me, I keep it real with you
'Cuz I know wit' you by my side there's nothing I can't do, yeah

[Jamie Foxx ? Chorus]
Baby, girl, if I, never show, I'd have you by my side
I'd build you up
Oooohhhooohhh
Girl I, need to know for sure your mine
Build you up, baby, when you're down,
Cuz your smile, like a frown, yes I will
I'm gon build you up baby
La la lahh, la la la la la la la lahh [repeat 8x]

[Intro/Chorus: 50 Cent]
God gave me stylllle, God gave me grace
- God give me style, God give me grace
God put a smilllle, on my face
- Ha ha, God put this smile on my face
God make me shiiiine, like the sun
- God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feeeeel, like I'm the one
- Sometimes I feel like I'm the one

[Break]
It ain't my fault, I just reach for style
I'm hot, I breaks it down
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down
The way I break it down

[50 Cent]
Listen you can call me what you want, black and ugly
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my CD's drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a track star runnin through life chasin my dreams
Best deal I made was tradin the mic for that triple beam
I zone off thinkin is there really heaven or hell
If so what happens to a changed man that dies in a cell?
I need no answers to these questions, cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me, but my music
It's a gift given from God, so I'ma use it - yeah

[Chorus] + [Break]

[50 Cent]
Some days I'm in the crowd, all by myself
Bunch of niggaz around, I'm still by myself
I drift off on a cloud, by myself
Thinkin 'bout nothin more, than life - what else?
These days it's hard to tell who really cares for me
So when you hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A O.G. told me God's favorites have a hard time
You're out the hood, that's good, now stay on the grind
I'm a sponge, knowledge and wisdom I ab-sorb fast
I'm in a class by myself, you do the math

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
It ain't my fault, yeah
Shoutout to Reverand Floyd Flake
It ain't my fault, Creflo Dollar, TD Jakes
Bishop Eddie L. Long. Easy-L shorty. Ha ha
Wooo! Feels good
Oh yeah, can't forget Bishop Morton
Cause my mama key on me, ha ha

[Chorus: Olivia]
Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
I'll be around to catch your call
Cuz you're my baby (you're my baby)
And I adore you
You always brighten up my day
I'll never ever let you wait
Cuz you're my baby (you're my baby)
And you're amazing (so amazing)

[50 Cent]
I'm from, city to city, to show to show
See me I been grinding across the globe
I hustle hard to get the grip fa'sho
So when I make time to call you, you should pick up the phone
Tell me, what's on your mind when you alone
I have you touching on yaself, girl all in the zone
Now if I turned you on
With things I say, would I be wrong?
Then I don't wanna be right
Matter of fact, I'd be on the next flight
Trying to get it on with you tonight
Do the things you like
Touch the right spot, have ya piping hot
While the wind blow through ya hair in the drop
Just lay back, relax to the sounds of the sex
And let me do what I do until you climax
You can go straight to sleep after it's all over
In the morning, roll over and we can start over

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Yeah, I called just to say
"Hope you're having a nice day"
You're special, I'd get into you
Oops, I mean I'm into you
Every chance I get, I find time to spend with you
Jet to bring you to me, just to watch a movie
Better yet, to watch you climb into the jacuzzi
Yeah, Bubbles in the bath, Don in the glass
Funny how time flies when you full of laughs
It's fun, but before long, a nigga gotta dash
For the lifestyle I live, a nigga need cash
To come quick, so I don't fuck with the stash
I know you like pumps and boots, I like Jeeps and Coupes
So I grind all the time to save me some loot
I put a spell on ya, I like to call it a spell
In the bedroom working it well, I don't kiss and tell
But I don't care if you kiss and tell
You can tell ya girlfriend the details

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[50 Cent]
Yeah, it is what it is man
Uh-huh

Sirens flashin you know the routine, the crime scene taped off
It started out a robbery, they blew half his face off
They seen him shinin, cross full of diamonds he bought grindin
His first slip off the ladder of success he was climbin
The D's came through, askin niggaz if they know what happened
Somehow my name end up in anything that involves clappin
Detectives at my mama crib, they say they wanna question me
They put me in a lineup last time and they arrested me
When it come to cookin coke, they know I got the recipe
I turn a quarter to a half, that's why they mess with me
I'm the neighborhood pusher, I move packs to make stacks
A little weed, a little X, a little H, little crack
Figure, I'll push it to the limit, take the shit to the max
Navy blue vest on, navy blue Yankee hat
Calm, in my palm's fully loaded firearm
First to let off last to run, everytime it's on

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I tell niggaz to suck my dick, get the fuck out my face
Cause I don't need 'em
Cause they're, never around, when I'm down
Shot and I'm bleedin

(What?  Nigga is there.. is there a motherfuckin problem nigga?)
(Oh, yeah that's what I, I thought so.. pussy!)

[50 Cent]
Niggaz be talkin 'bout me, they always callin me crazy
Fuck them O.G. niggaz, they stuck in the 80's
Sayin they gon' do me somethin, now you know that's a lie
Nigga you look at me wrong I let the hammer fly
I'm rich, I still wake up, with crime on my mind
Queens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime
When I say move, nigga move, or get caught in the crossfire
I prevents runnin, cut my fuckin hand on the barbed wire
This shit's crazy, it's just a different day it's the same shit
Hollow-tip partin yo' head, leave your whole fuckin brain split
They sick, they see me in that Aston Martin
What's the matter?  They can't get that hooptie started
Thought they was grindin, well God damn, where that money at?
Thought you was puffed up, cause you was lettin paper stack
You ain't a hustler, matter fact, youse a buster
I don't trust ya, I should send niggaz to touch ya

[Chorus]

(What?  Who say they gon' do somethin to me?)
(Must be out your rabbit-ass mind, fuck around kill one of these niggaz)

[50 Cent]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh..

Comin up I was confused, my mommy kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check check out +My Melody+"
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggaz had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent] + (The Game)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP)
(And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[The Game]
I told Dre from the gate "I'd carry the heat for ya"
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya
Put Compton on my back when you in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my N.W.A. gold
I had the whole crowd yellin "Free Yayo!"
So niggaz better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C.
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your lil' rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West coast mouth-to-mouth?

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent] + (Lloyd Banks)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP)
(And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[50 Cent]
From the beginnin to the end, losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change, it's stayin' the same

[Lloyd Banks]
How many of them boys is witcha'
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walking with a snub, cause niggaz do a lot of slick talkin
in the club 'til they coughin on the rug
Ain't never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke, my boy just got poked in the throat
Now it's an Auggie shirt and my coat
Now I'm speedin, reminiscin; holdin my weed in, never listen
If I see him I'ma lift 'em
And maybe that'll even the score
But if not, it'll be me on the floor

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent] + (Tony Yayo)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP)
(And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[Tony Yayo]
I started out at 15, scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and made them sales
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil deuce-deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin +Easy Jesus+, rockin a leases
My momma wit me when she found my pieces
I look back on life, thank God I'm blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest

[Young Buck]
You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, it's a hood thang; that's why I'm loved in Brook-lyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey, I'm still all good
Let me show you what a thug bout I'm born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put 'em in my fo'-five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent] + (Young Buck)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP)
(And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[Chorus]
Nigga, my gun go off!! 
You see tha barrell turnin'
You feel tha hollows burnin'
Nigga, now you learnin'

Nigga, my gun go off!! 
Call it attempted murder
Nigga I'm trynna merk ya
When I come back, bussin'

Nigga, my gun go off!! 
Don't trynna say I'm trippin'
When I get to flippin'
Then I smack tha clip in

Nigga, my gun go off!! 
We call it puttin' work in
Leavin' niggas hurtin'
Homocide's lurkin'

Nigga, my gun go off!!

[Verse 1]
Fuck boy you can see it to belie' it
Trynna dodge and wave it, end up a parapelegic
Belie' me, it's easy
I'll hurt you, I'll merk you, I'll pop some'in
Drop some'in, I ain't gone stop huntin'
Run-run till you're spun
One shot, one gun
One-9... 1-1, emergency
It's murder B
It's excellent execution when I'm pullin' tha trigga
No mistake, for that cake
I'm hittin' you and ya niggas
Feel tha flame when I aim
For tha top of ya brain
See tha spark and tha bang
Nigga shit ain't a game
Do tha math or get blast
Bullets go thru tha glass
Go-thru-ya-ass, fast
And tha leather seat sittin' Ave
Nigga
It's not a war when there's casualties on one side
I ride!
Turn it up on you niggas after Jay ride-by
I click-clack, that's that! I don't flash, I mash
I wave tha Uzi at 'em
I make a movie out 'em

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yeahh.
You better lose yourself in tha moment
Use it, fuck-tha-music, I'ma let it go!
You only get one shot before I back out and fire back
At ya hat, cha back, ya ass crack, ya nutsack
Ya caddilac, if you make it to that--I'm hittin' that!
The 70's was smack, 80's crack! 90's was grimey
Millenium macs, man
Clips on tha whips, I ride in 'em
Bad bitches I ride-inn 'em
Don't worry, I'll gett'em
Gat Jammed or un-jammed
Goddamn safest the safety don't work
Squeeze tha Eagle, it chirp
End up faced down in the durt--more than hurt
Bring tha beef where you hang out
Bang out
Shots rang out!
Hit ya shoulders, trynna blow ya brains out!
Hit ya hommies in they legs
Bet they have their canes out, tomorrow
You know tomorrow's just a day away
If you can keep ya heart beatin' then ya ass awake!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
AOWWWW~! It hurts...
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah - YEAH!!

D's tryin to plant a murder on me
In the precinct they sayin I done murdered homey
I told my lawyer I ain't heard of homey
And e'rybody know my niggaz buried him fo' me
You see I'm on your crib it ain't a burglary homey
They fin' to have me stuck in purgatory
I'm down to do the stickin when it come to the orgy
Conventional methods of sex, totally bore me
Wait~! I'm gettin sidetracked, back to the story
These cocksuckin {*censored*} got it in fo' me
{*censored*} they wanna {*censored*} me up
{*censored*} me find my burner and {*censored*} me up
But history repeats itself, they never learn
The Unit's the new people who gon' {*censored*}
Huh, we'll find out when niggaz let off the rounds
And this {*censored*} screamin {*censored*} down

[Chorus]
Get in the way, I'll murder dem

A nigga already got three strikes, I'll murder dem
I said I'll murder dem
Any motherfucker touch me, I'll murder dem
I'll murder dem
You don't believe me wait and see, I'll murder dem
You see I told you I'd murder dem

[50 Cent]
They sayin I'm an accident waitin to happen
I got one in the head, I'm just waitin to clap it
A pimp told me I was made for this mack shit
So just get you a white girl, don't fuck with no black bitch
I got two felonies, from sellin that crack shit
And the third one, came from showin niggaz my mac spit
See I'm down for that daytime action
Have niggaz crawlin under cars when I start to cappin
So they don't know what to say to the {*censored*}
But they know if word get back, somethin gon' happen
I've been shot, I've been stabbed, but I ain't been snitched on
When you snitchin where I'm from you gon' get your shit blown
Southside - I make the best of the worst
We gotta share the same bitch, okay I go first
Cause your, baby's momma is my, baby's momma
I come through to see my little nigga with the llama

[Chorus]

[Chorus: Akon]
Ohhhh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nuttin change still holla at my homies
Ohh and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggaz get to fuckin around
If niggaz get to fuckin around

[50 Cent]
Yeah... respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me if you could catch one in your wig
You see the Testarosa, the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line and nigga get clapped
I got a arsenal, an infantry I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now nigga I'll be the end of you
Forget your enemies and think of what your friends'll do
I drop a bag off, they'll let a mag off
The Heckler and Koch'll tear half of your ass off
I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playing
The hollow tips rain, when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lines or get the message from the 9
Paint a picture with words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine
I let 21 shots off at the same time, YEAH!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Yeah... where I'm from death is always in the air homie
Nana love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creepin through the hood wearin teflon
Hit the corners motherfuckers get left on
Niggaz know, if not they better check my background
Try and stick me I'll fill your back with mac rounds
Ask Prim' nigga 50 don't "Back Down"
I kick it funky like fiends in the crack house
Cross the line boy I'ma air ya ass out
Screw your face at me I wanna know what that's 'bout
Nigga I know you ain't mad I done came up
And if you are, fuck you cause I ain't change up
The O.G.'s wanna talk but I don't know these niggaz
And I ain't did no business wit 'em, I don't owe these niggaz
a minute of my time, I get it cause I grind
All across the globe like the world's mine, YEAH!

[Chorus]

[Akon]
{*cell door slams*} Konvict
Now tell me have you ever looked off in the distance
and seen the mac aimin at your head mayne (head mayne)
Before you know it life is flashin reminiscin
and your body is drippin and full of lead mayn (lead mayne)
I done been there (uh-huh) I done copped that (uh-huh)
It ain't never been a question I'm bout that (uh-huh)
Don't go there (uh-huh) you get clapped at (uh-huh)
And if you plan to fuck around and re-route that (uh-huh)
You'll never catch me ridin around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons unloaded will unleash
Stash up under the carpet like a can of sea breeze
50 don't make me ride on these niggaz (ay)
Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggaz (ohhhh)
50 don't make me ride on these niggaz (ay)
Cause I be long gone like the ripper, so

[Verse 1]
I took quarter water sold it in bottles for 2 bucks
And Coca-Cola came and bought it; for billions, what the fuck?
Have a baby by me baby, be a millionaire
I write the check before the baby comes, who the fuck cares
I'm stanky rich, I'ma die tryna spend this shit
Southsides' up in in this bitch
Yeah I smell like the vault, I used to sell dope
I did play the block-now I play on boats
In the south of France baby, St. Tropez
Get a tan, I'm already black, rich, I'm already that
Gangsta, get a gat, hit a head in a hat
Call that a river rat, shit, fuck the chitter chat
The baker, I bake the bread-the barber, I cut your head
The marksman, I spray the led-"Blood clot, chop your leg!"
Do not fuck with the kid
I get biz with the cigg, I come where you live, ya dig?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You can call this my new shit, but it ain't new though
I got rid of my old bitch, now I got new hoes
First it was the Benzo, now I'm in the Enzo
Ferrari, I'm sorry! I keep blowin up! (Oh!!)
They call me the cake man, the strawberry shake man
I spray the AR, make your whole click break dance
Back spin, head spin, flatline, your dead then
9 shells, Mac-10, "Who wan' get it crackin?!"
I was young, I couldn't do good, now I can't do bad
I ride, wreck the new Jag, I just buy the new Jag
Now nigga why you mad? Oh you can't do that?
I'm so forgetful, they callin me cocky
I come up out the jeweler, they callin me Rocky
It's the ice on my neck man, the wrist and my left hand
Bling like bloaw, you like my style
Ha Ha-I'm heading to the bank right now!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, I talk the talk, and I walk the walk
Like a teflon Don, but I run New York
When I come outta court, yea I pop the cork
I keep it gangsta, I have ya outlined in chalk(I-I Get It)
In the hood if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya I'm about my bread(I-I Get It)
Round the world if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya they love the kid (I-I Get It)

Bring 'em in, kick 'em out, bring 'em in, kick 'em out
Bring 'em in, you ain't freakin we ain't speakin bitch

[50 Cent]
They said we couldn't do it, look now, I did it
I topped "In Da Club," I'm still sippin the bubb'
The drama I'm widdit, I get biz, you get it
I breezed on that shiddit, I split your widdig
That's why a nigga bit it, I can't forget it
I said I didn't do it, witnesses said I did it
I'm fresh out on bail, my Benz is all kitted
Five TV's, my rims is so siddick
I cruise through your bitch and just fall in love with it
Baby come in - girl I wanna give it to you
Once I'm in - in sum, I'm a freak with it
Money come quiddick, hot shit I spit it
G-Unit kitted, blue New York fitted
Shorty wanna cut, oh yeah, I'm with it
She come to my hotel room, she know she gon' get it
It's exercise, my homey he been waitin
He next to ride

[Chorus]

[50 Cent - singing]
People always talkin 'bout
My reputation~! I don't love 'em, I don't need 'em
I don't love 'em, I don't need 'em, I don't love 'em
I don't care, what she do, with him
It's all good with me
Soo-oooh-ooooooooh

[50 Cent]
Yeah
They can't do it how I do it, I'm #1, I knew it
I thug, do my thang, and gangsters bop to it
It's hit after hit, damn I'm on the road
I'm like James Brown now, man I got soul
Naw I ain't a pimp but HELL YEAH I got hoes
I was born due to this, when I breathe I make a killin
You think I'm bullshittin, my money touchin the ceiling
Can't buy condos, I'm buyin the building
I'm pissin the wrong women, R. Kelly do it to children
You bet against me boy, I'ma hurt your feelings
Cause over and over I'ma keep on winnin
My Rolls Royce tinted, your Phantom rented
That's why we never ever ever see you in the hood with it
Man e'rybody know, like e'rywhere I go
When 50 in the club shit just go out of control
You can blame it on Em, or blame it on Dre; okay~!

In the fantasy, it's plain to see, just how it be, her and me
Backstrokin, sweat soakin, all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch till the club close
Watchin her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down

Different style, different mood, damn I like the way you move

From the couch to the counters in my kitchen

[Intro: Robin Thicke] + (50 Cent)
Girl when I go, where we go, I wanna take you 'round the globe with me
I got dough (ha ha) plenty baby you can blow with me
And baby I know (uh-huh) that money ain't ev-ery-thing
But it's fo' sho' (fo' sho, fo' sho') and ain't for nothin when you fuck, with, me
Now when I go

[Chorus: 50 Cent] + (Robin Thicke)
(Follow my lead)
Baby I can be all you need, if you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me
Baby follow my lead (follow my lead)
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me
Follow my lead - follow my lead
I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead

[50 Cent]
Don't listen to the rumors, they say 50 fuckin crazy
50 don't know how to treat a lady, they wrong
I like you a lot, I don't wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I'll call you a bitch
Then hang up, probably call you right back and shit
And have to say, "Baby I apologize"
Cross my fingers, God forgive me for tellin lies
Like Janet Jackson said, I miss you much
I really wanna feel your touch, and smell your scent
Baby I can pass the day
Watchin you model lingerie
I wanna spend the night tonight shorty if it's okay
You can be my Beyonce, I'll be your Jay
Ha ha~! I got a great sense of humor
First I make you smile then I woo you, you know I wanna do ya
Or do ya?

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
After seven hours, New York to London, you're wonderin
What's gon' be the next stop - I told you
I'm a don, you gon' know I'm a don
After you shop 'til your feet hurtin in Milan
Now take a picture, these are moments you can cherish
They say the scenery was made for lovers out in Paris
Ask your fam about me, they say 50 we love him
Without them there's no me, so I love them
Man they're the reason I exist, the reason I insist
I'm never less than the best, I'm perfection I guess
As my niggaz are stressed, I pass the test
Everytime I drop, I'm burnin hot
So I don't care if she loves me or loves me not
Long as I enjoy the time that we spend
I ain't lookin for commitment, we can fuck and be friends
Matter fact, we can do it right in back of my Benz
I get it done with speed

[Chorus] (with Robin Thicke ad libs)

{*more ad libs to fade*}

50 Cent

In case a mother fucker got to get shot
The old timers tell me, slow down
See they know now, I won't hesitate to make shit hot
D's will shut your block down, after your shot down
We gonna come through and set up shop
You niggas gon' work for me now, you gon' see now
How I change shit, re-arrange shit
See for you dog, this is new shit
I'm from Southside, nigga we do this
They say I'm grimey, it's hard to find me
When the sun lighten up the sky
Niggas wanna line me, try and kill me
Go 'head nigga I dare you to try, fuck that nigga!

[Chorus]
We movin on up, yeah we gettin' that dough, fo' sho'
We movin on up, yo' whip chromed up
Cash is flow fo' sho, the dough, nigga you know what?
We movin on up, yeah we gettin' that dough, fo' sho'

Cash is flow fo' sho, the dough, nigga you know what?

[Verse 2]
Im 'bout my bread now, I'll cut your head now
You know you eatin' niggas you should be dead now
I hold a glock down, I gotta drop now
Nigga I'm eatin' you know I aint gon' stop now
One more trip, one more flip
I move a truckload nigga, not one brick
They make me so sick, fuckin' sick to my stomach
You niggas talk shit, but they know they don't I want it
My clicks so sick, niggas know how we on it
Light up more shit, the car there when we on it
I spit a gem star get'cha carved my name on yo' neck
Have my lil homies run up on yo' ass with the tech
Yeah I stunt in the Vette , got stash in the bank
I get head in the whip, I get ass on the jet
I'm oh so fresh, so  motherfuckin' clean
24" Inch gleam, when I pull up on the scene

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Been smokin' that dip, the PCP got 'em thinkin' they can walk on water
That ecstasy will have a nigga rock hard tryna fuck your daughter
The LSD will have niggas runnin' round tryna kill you for us
Smokin' that piff, sippin' that yak, talkin' that shit, loadin' that strap

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Yeah!!! When I'm out in N.Y. boy it's blunts and phillies
When I'm out in L.A. boy it's wraps and swishes
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit

[Verse 1]:
I'm in my Labo maggot, my fo' fo' faggot
Doors lift up I'm like Go Go Gadget
See the shit I got on, homey I hate too
My teflon arm brought my government issues
I'll hit your vertebrae bullets rip through tissues
Your wife on the futon huggin that skitzo
Homey you a bitch you got feminine ways
Heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days
I got fo' fifths and bananas on the case
And got more whips than a runaway slave
Me and Yayo go back like some high top fades
When I made fifty mill, Em got paid
When I made sixty mill, Dre got paid
When I made eighty mill, Jimmy got paid
I ain't even gotta rap now life is made
Said I ain't even gotta rap, I'm filthy mayne

[Chorus]:
I'm laughin straight to the bank with this (Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha) 
I'm laughin straight to the bank with this (Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

I'm laughin straight to the bank with this (Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha) 
I'm laughin

[Verse 2]:
I see nothin but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll
I got the kind of money that the bank can't hold
Got it off the street movin bundles and loads
Seventy Three Caprice old school when I roll
Breeze pass with the EZ Pass fuck the toll
No more platinum I'm wearin gold
I'm internationally known as the kid with the flow
That brings enough dough it's never enough dough
Shit I need mo' I need shit out the sto'
Baby ble was cold fresh out the flo'
Stashbox by the dashbox incase they want war
Make the purple bring the green in fuck the law
I'm oh so raw, I'm hot I'm sure
I'm like the coolest motherfucker around the globe boy
I set the club on fire I told ya
I'm the general salute me soldier

[Chorus]:
I'm laughin straight to the bank with this (Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

I appear and disappear wit' the heata like Houdini
Dat parry and bullshit'll git cha azz popped
Don't believe me - ask Fab, they got his head shot
I'm in the cut like germs, I do durrt like worms
Smoke weed, now I'm sure, nigga it's my turn
I fire on ya azz, dem hollow-tips burn, baby burn
I'm screamin' "Fuck the cops!", ride 'round wit' my glock
There's my pistol on my bitch, nigga fuck dat box!
Dat's how P. got knocked, dat's a jewel I drop
But you ain't peep dat nigga, go 'head, repeat dat nigga
You might learn a lil' summin' if you learn to stop frontin'
I make it look easy on three piece bb's, rollin' locc-in'
Up early wit' the dopemane
 
[Chorus]
When Janet and Jermaine was *Mm mm*, kissin'
I was baggin' one-thousand grams in my kitchen
When Puffy just tellin' Kim, "I love you boo"
I was shinin' my nine, ya know how I do
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
 
[Verse 2]
At the dice game I bet it all, you hear wha I'm sayin'?
Take grand, I form betta nigga I ain't playin'
I'm trynna git it, holla at me if ya wit' it
And lace up the chuckas, we can rob these mothafuckas
My stomach is growlin', they say dat I'm wyllin'
I'm doin' my numbas, I'm gittin' violent
They hearin' me rap and they think dat I'm playin'
Till they see the barrel and they see the flame
I need full co-operation man, give us the chain
The watch, the ring and the grill - we ain't playin'
I fire dat thang, it sound insane
Holla, I got dat nose candi mayne
   
[Chorus]
When Jeezy and Keisha was *Mm mm*, kissin'
I was baggin' one-thousand grams in my kitchen
When Trina was tellin' Wayne, "I love you boo"
She was just runnin' games, she told Buck dat too
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
 
[Outro w/ ad-libin "I got-I got fully loaded clip"]
Now nigga, lemme show ya how I do this right here!

One in the head, 'till it fell!
I put anutha one in it the clip, I put it back!
Dat was big wit' all dat, let the bullets breathe!

Enough to make a nigga lose control
I'm down to go wherever you wan' go
You got a man, I keep it on the low
I do my thing you know I gets my dough

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
On your mark, get set girl now here we go

When you're breakin it down, keep breakin it down
 
[50 Cent]
They say I'm not the same it's cause I'm filthy mayne

I'm hustlin hard homie I do my thang
You fuck with the paper then watch the hammer go bang
Now shorty I like the way she move them hips
I'm tryin to get her in my bedroom and shit
We could take a long time or get it done quick
We can camcord this shit make a boom-boom flick

Girl your body's callin me, hear you loud and clear
We ain't got to leave now we can do it right here
 
[Chorus]
 
[50 Cent]
The way you move (the way you move)
You make me lose (you make me lose)
All control (all control)

You're so seductive you make me wanna touch it
I ain't got to tell you, you know I wanna fuck you
I'm feelin your style, you better watch me now
My tongue'll be in your mouth, my hands'll be in your blouse
When you get me aroused you put a spell on me
Man if I can't have you I'ma go crazy
I want you bad now and if you want me
Girl come to me now, I said come to me now
 
[Eminem]
Come to me now, you don't come to me now
Apple in your mouth, tackled on the couch
Shackled in the house, I'll be back in about
20 minutes or less, with my Hannibal mask
So when you wiggle around and giggle in that cage
I knew I couldn't wait to get you off that stage
From the moment I met you had to let you know
I just wanted to get you through my bedroom do'
You makin me feel like I'm in middle school still
You squeal like a little girl, you're pitiful, chill
We gon' fuck, I just popped this little blue pill
You can leave but wait, I gotta shit on you still {*phbbt*}

I hope you really gettin into my creep show
Let me shit on your chest and if some pee comes out
Just guzzle it down, just guzzle it down
 
[Chorus]
 
[50 Cent]
It's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault

Can you break it down? It's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
I can break it down, it's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
Can you break it down? It's not my fault c'mon

[50 Cent]
I make it hotter... friction turns to fire
You want and desire... I'm comin to get you girl
That's right, that's right, it's on tonight
You're just my type, you're what I like
I bring that heat, you heard me right
Everywhere I go, go, LET'S GO~!
Somethin new it's another episode
Music bumpin, sweat drippin on the danceflo'
I like it when shorty get to backin it back
When she do it like that, I don't know how to act

[Breakdown: 50 Cent]
Now work it
Shorty grind it on me, that's perfect
I'll pay to play if it's worth it
My phone when you want me you can chirp it - if you work it

[Young Buck]
Let me take these bricks and break 'em down
If you want I can serve 'em by the pound
Shorty know she's got what I wanna flip
Baby girl tell me you can handle it

[Chorus: Nicole]
Well if you want it let's go
I got that FIRE!! So hot I burn it down
Act like you already know
I got that FIRE!! Cause I'm the flyest chick around
You want it, it's fire, I got it, that fire
So I'm might, ignite ya, it's fire, it's fire

[50 Cent]
I burn it down on stage, I make it hot
'Til the fire marshall come shut down the spot
I have the club jam packed everytime I rock
These other niggaz ain't got the style I got
I go back to the basics and break it all the way all the way down
You can hate it but face it B.I.G. and Tupac just ain't around
Everywhere you go, there I go, I'm 50 Cent
Ghetto star by the bar I get you bent
You wanna party, you wanna freak be a freak
You wanna freak we can freak tell me where we should we meet
So you can

[Young Buck]
Take these bricks and break 'em down
If you want I can serve 'em by the pound
Shorty know she's got what I wanna flip
Baby girl tell me you can handle it

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Now are you really ready
I said, are you really ready
I make the temperature rise, now don't be surprised
I have the ice on, stuntin heavy
I got a helluva flow, you should already know
Sold over 30 million records already
It's the third time around, you know how I get down
I'm hands down, pound for pound, the best around

[Breakdown]

[50 Cent]
Yeah, yeah, YEAH
YEAHH~!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Now if I give you all of me
What'chu gon' give me back?
Your body is callin me
Got me feelin like a fiend on crack
Why you gonna make me fall in love?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now if I give you all of me
Tell me what'chu gon' give me back?

[50 Cent]
Let's start with the moon and the stars, whatever you into
The money I acquire mama make it all simple
Flashback oh-three, paparazzi flashin flicks
I moved away, hustle hard, now I got a sick stash
Tell me you miss me, baby come here and kiss me
MWAH~! .. It just happened so quickly
Feels like I hopped off a bus and got in a Bentley
It's gangsta my music, even when it's the smooth shit
You can hate me cause I hurt you but I ain't mean to do it
Em predicted it all, I don't know how he knew it
He said women from Hollywood, they LIAR-LIAR-LIARS
You fuck 'em they get you heated, deny you like Mariah
Fast forward to oh-six, I'm still on fire
The world is still turnin, my records are still earnin
Dough come quicker and quicker, flow gets sicker and sicker
Straight up and down baby, I'm a special kind of nigga

[Chorus]

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Ohhh, give it (give it) BABY (BABY)
Give it (give it) OH BABY~!
Give it (give it) baby (baby)
Give it give it baby baby (oh baby)

[50 Cent]
Life is short baby, be a part of my dreams
I own Ferarri horses, my Lamborghini leans
So mean, I have niggaz hatin on me
God gave me a gift, I'm supposed to be rich
I'm supposed to ride through the hood and make niggaz sick
When my homies put in work, they supposed to get hit
With a piece of chain thick and go and buy 'em some bricks
I ain't make that up, this is how it's 'sposed to be kid
You should feel like a life, but then get back that time
When I smile your smile should be as big as mines
Girl to know me's to love me, I'm one of a kind
Even when you hate me you love me, forever you're mine

[Chorus] + [Hook]

[Mary J. Blige]
What you gonna give me back~!
You're gonna make me fall in love {*2X*}
Ohhhhhhhhhhahhhhhhhh, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH YEAH YEAHH HAH YEAHHHH

[50 Cent]
Ay nigga tell 'em where you from!
Southside, I'm a Southside nigga what
Nigga stunt, you know I tear a nigga up

[Chorus]
They say I'm grimy, I'm greasy
I make a one-eight-seven look easy
Fuck that~! I lay my murder game down
Push me nigga, see what I'm about

[50 Cent]
I was a snotty nose, nappy head, dirtball nigga
Sayin I can't wait 'til I get a little bigger
After niggaz jumped me, bumpin my head
Thinkin I wish I had a gun I fill a nigga with lead
Took a kitchen knife to {*censored*} fin' to poke me a nigga
Wishin I had a gun so I could smoke me a nigga
Sold my first five quarter gram pieces in the alley
Where Bizzy had the Bondeville and Kev had the Caddy
Now those were the days, when crime really paid
The nine milli sprayed, I got the fuck out the way
From shootout to shootout, the bricks went fast
Robberies went bad, niggaz got blast
Niggaz kidnapped Drew grandpa kid
Came through and shot Ms. Leak in the head
You wonder why I got a gun? So I can get down for mine
You need that, out on the grind all the time

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[50 Cent]
It was Kangols, Cazelli shades, Pumas and corn braids
Doo-rags on the waist, brass knuckles, switchblades
Ski mask to get paid, new shells to get sprayed
Hoodrats to get laid, money to get made
YEAHHH~! .. Yeah I had a dream
I was rich, woke up broke, gun in my hand
Sayin DAMN! .. Dope cost sixty a gram
I got to find me a nigga, line me a nigga
And say "Give it up kid, before I put one in your wig"
Picture me thirsty, ridin 'round foamin out the mouth
Sayin "I don't get on, I'ma lay a nigga out"
Now diamonds are beautiful and pearls are precious
I hit you and your bitch both over your necklace
I'm wreckless, I spray the semi drunk off Henny
Wipe your blood off the shines, run and sell 'em to Benny
Fuck with me, y'all niggaz know Boo Boo get bizzy

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[50 Cent]
Yeah
I gave Just a buck-fifty, ask him if I cut niggaz
Shootouts in Bedford, ask them if I bucked niggaz
In four-fifth they call me Boo Boo, the accident baby
Hennessy and cocaine helped to grime me and make me
My eyes don't cry, I'm a fatherless child
Got my ass whooped in Spofford but never that now
When my name in your mouth, you better watch how you talk
I'll send yo' punk ass to therapy to learn how to walk
I bust a clip, I'll hit ya hip, I'm takin your shit
Thats how the eses play, for that SSK
Your probably heard through the grapevine, I'm good out in Watts
Bulletproof shit, cruisin through them Compton blocks
I'm the beast from the East, but I play on the West
In the drop by myself with my nine and my vest
And you niggaz best be on yo' best behaviors
I was bred for this shit, front on me I'ma blaze ya

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Chorus]
[5C] Man I run this rap shit

[50 Cent]
You wan' dance, let's dance nigga, I take you to the prom
I'm armed, trey-pound in my palm, I'm calm nigga
My momma made a baby boy, the hood made a man
My first 14 grams, took that and made a grand
I do this, you knew this, I told you pussy
Your fate, your death day to fuckin come if you push me
Have you like E.I. E.I., uh-ohhh after the four-four blow
I get low, they say I go like a pro
It's a wrap, and I'm ghost, in the smoke, like a roach
You've been clapped, and in fact, there's no comin back from that
I'm the last of my breed, no Henny, no weed
Just my vest, and my semi, in the back, of the Bentley
Enage, a mirage, see I'm there, then I'm gone
Cause my lawyers are strong and my money is long
So when I'm right I'm right, and when I'm wrong I'm right
I hit your ass up right, nigga it's nighty-night

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]
Yeah! Yeah! Yo, YO
Aiyyo I'm higher than a pilot man, I catch a body man
Beat the case, I lie on the polygram
These O.G.'s talkin 'bout, back in the days
I have a R.I.P. sign, on your MySpace page
I'm in your, top 8 nigga, drop 8 nigga
G-C-T Coupe, it's sour grape nigga
I'm a ape nigga, a guerilla in the mist
I HOLD WEIGHT NIGGA~! My connect got bricks
I went gold, you went platinum, we still got the same cars
Same house, and still fuck the same broads (I ain't lyin)
Dreams of fuckin an R&B bitch
Damn you look good girl but get your teeth fixed
I'm the Teflon Don boy, I get busy
Your next two songs you do them shits with Pretty Ricky
Seven-sixty, drive by light tint
With two hoes in the whip lookin like flint

[Chorus]

[Intro]
(Classic) That's right it's a motherfuckin classic!
Yeah... yeah... it's 50 nigga!... Yeah... yeah... yeah. Yeah

[Verse 1]
Smile nigga my next album might be my last
Got what I came to get, the stacks and the stash
I told Jimmy Iovine ass to shut the fuck up
Got Dre callin' Shady sayin Em what's up?
We done came this far, we can't stop now
Em, 50 off the hook, he got to calm down
I guess I'm out of control, my mind, body and soul
Tell me I'm bein pimped and it's makin me sick
You know Em made that company over a billion dollars
And when he ain't around they sayin foul shit about him
Yeah we fucked up, we both don't know our pops
We both don't like the cops, we don't know when to stop
You know Kim is Shaniqua and Hailey is Marquise
D-12's G-Unit and we always in beef
Ja and Fred Durst, both of them jerks
Got put out the game, ha, ha, ya lames!
Paul's Chris Lighty, Tracy's Nicki Martin
Boxes of ox, sarge is a glock
My nine is twenty four seven on watch

[Verse 2]
You know Oprah got In Da Club on her iPod
She don't want me on her show though I guess I'm too hard
She sat Kanye West down, and talked about his crash
But she don't wanna talk about the bullets in my ass
Spike Lee don't like it that my money come fast
I hate it when a nigga get to countin my cash
Now I can give the kids a positive message like Farrakhan
Or I can give 'em pistols and targets to squeeze 'em on
I'm tryin to make a decision damn, leave me alone
I'm like Martin Luther King people listen to me a lot
It's non violent, non violent till I'm hit with a rock
Then it's Coretta fuck this, go and get me my glock
Wanna call me crazy? Okay it's cool
I'll have your kids tryin to be, crazy cool in school
Truth is they like me, more than they like you
They watch me and emulate, everything I do

[Chorus]
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
I have days when I feel like everybody's against me
Sharpton ain't comin when the feds snatch 50
Just my luck Johnnie Cochran passed
Right before the crackers come snatch my ass
I'm the Don King of crack, the Pretty Floyd of rap
Put Southside on the map, I did that
Bill O'Reilly can't stand me but his woman think I'm cute
I bet she wanna see me in my birthday suit
Met Al Gore and his wife in them first class seats
She said she didn't like rap until she met me
You gotta understand I'm a charmin young man
A whole lot has changed since I went hand to hand

[Chorus]
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah
Smile nigga my next album might be my last, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]

Smile for me! If I gotta go away to make you feel better

My money right, ya nah mean I'm good don't worry 'bout me I'm good
Ya know? This is about you now, is it 'gon make you happy to see me gone?
Are you gonna miss me when I'm gone?
Are you just gonna forget about me? I meant nothin to you?
Is that what you sayin to me? 
Cause ya breakin my heart...
Hahaha, I mean you're really breakin my heart

Did him dirty and ran away, who's the next candidate?
Get hit with the cannon AY! You lil' niggaz wan' play
We can go back and forth in broad day
Let it off, hop in the rental car, pull away smooth
Put that twerk in that work and we at you with the tools
Nigga we ain't sellin packs no more so we ain't on the strip
Got that llama in the 'Llac strapped leanin in the whip

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
First I find your bitch creep, then we found a nail shop
Now would you looky here, we done found your momma's spot
It's so easy, damn I'm greasy
Goons don't use Auto-Tune, that's Yeezy
Yeah, summer now, good time to hunt you down
Keep the pump around, we catch him we gon' slump him now
Timin is everything, I plot it out perfect
Drop a bag off to my nigga just to make it worth it

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]

When you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
Catch him in a hoopty, squeeze hit him through the do'

[50 Cent]
It's nuttin to it, cock it, bang it and get rid of that
Hit his fitted cap, he won't get a chance to Twitter that
I make the Ruger sing a song, bullets hum to you
You better have God wit'chu when I come to you
I'm a grimy nigga, I said some simple shit
You's a dirty nigga with syphilis on your dick
I catch you I'ma wash you up, line you, spit-shine you
Leave you right there in the street, where niggaz can find you
Die nigga die, fly pelican fly
When I pull it eat a bullet, don't question me why
What's the laws of the jungle, I'll show you what the gun do
My bad, what the shell do; you rot until they smell you

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Get green son get him, cut his head
He didn't even see it comin, he sleepin that's what he did
Get biz, niggaz actin like it ain't what it is
Let the knife work push the blade up in his shit
Let Doc come sew him up, gang signs throw 'em up
In my hood growin up - you pussy or you bout it
You shootin or you runnin, the police comin
Niggaz get at you, you get at them or you don't mean nuttin
Niggaz walk tough, even walk like warriors
On some G shit they get to singin like Gloria
Now come clean, tell us what you told the D's
Matter fact don't tell us shit, motherfucker hold this

[Chorus]

Please don't interrupt me when I'm talkin to my jeweler
He's puttin them diamonds all over my Franck Muller

Come through hit you up, I'll make a crime scene perfect
Niggaz talk about me all the time behind my back
They don't talk about me in my face because I'm strapped
See me in the club, I got that Henny and that 'gnac
A couple cups of that and I just don't know how to act
By the second bottle that's when I just get to buzzin
I say I run New York and ain't nobody sayin nothin (okay okay okay)

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I blew a hundred G's on my bitches in Miami
They think I'm the sweetest thing invented since candy
Me I catch amnesia when you ask me 'bout the shotty
I don't even know my name, switchin lanes in my Bugatti
Nigga I ain't crazy, bitches like me cause I'm paid
They want me, LeBron, Kobe or Dwyane Wade
When I say I'm ballin I'm not talkin 'bout a ball
I'm talkin 'bout Tiffany & Co. stones out the mall
Niggaz they can hate all they want but they know they like this
Me I'm like that paintin on the wall, baby I'm priceless
You could come and work me over baby on the night shift
Catch me on the night shift, see how freaky I get (okay okay okay)

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Okay okay okay okay - sho' you right
Okay okay okay okay - you know you right
Okay, alright, okay, alright
Okay, alright, okay, you're right

{"Oh it's too late, oh it's too late"}

[50 Cent]
If I hit him I'll hurt him, I just catch him and murk him
I'm not sittin here waitin for him to come back ? naw!
Soon as I spot him I got him, I'ma run up and drop him
Get that P-90 poppin, nigga hold that ? uhh!
I get the gun and they runnin, niggaz know me for dumbin
I got a good reputation, what the fuck can I say
Some of these niggaz is bitches, yeah most of 'em snitches
So I don't let 'em know it's me, doin dirt when it's me
I know just how to work it, I can make it go perfect
Have the homicides sittin there, scratchin their head
To me a victim's a victim, you could pay me and pick 'em
Then I hunt him down and take his head off like I dare ya

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I bet you think that I'm vicious, catch you huggin and kissin
While the love's in the air, I put a hole in your heart
Plus so now that I'm missin, I'm a fuckin magician
You might find my DNA, all over your broad
Me and my cannibal methods, I eat you niggaz for breakfast
See the cannon respect it, nigga take off the chain (now!)
Robberies turn to murder, I do shit you ain't heard of
Change my mind and just pop you, in a blink of an eye
I know you thought I was bluffin, but to me this is nothin
Now you can lay there, leakin, go 'head curl up and die
You tell God when you see him, I'll be happy to meet him
I went to service this evenin, he forgives, not I

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
It's murder
Nothin but murder

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Cash Rules, I keep a shooter 'round me, Queens!
Get the money, I have a nigga killed y'all (killed y'all)
Kill the hood, ask niggaz 'bout me, Jesus!
For the money, niggaz'll go real hard (real hard)

[50 Cent]
You are now under my hypnosis
Summertime grind, come out with the toasters

New money breathe, new enemies, nigga you know this
Another mil', another nigga sick
I got nothin but hard dick for your bitch to lick
I box you orthodox out boy, outlaw bricks of raw
I'm out in the grind, I make the dope price soar
Shit cool 'til the mac out, run when it back out
A nigga finna blackout, better pray that bitch jam
It's in God's hands, it's all God plan
You mean even when a nigga gettin smoked, goddamn

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I push my pen with passion, I'm the author of the struggle
When pain is a head crack, designer of the devil
Trip' 6-6-6, I'm back on my bullshit
See clear through my third eye; it's gon' be a murda
E'ry summer, e'ry winter, e'ry spring
You think I'm bullshittin I put that on e'rything
The shootin gon' stop right after the shit-talkin
I was sellin crack while Mike was moonwalkin
20 off a pack, I stack, I can't call it
I blast ya like NASA, Jack, you outta orbit
I mean you outta order, you don't want me to send a nigga to you
So he could put some hot shit through you, do you?

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, I'm back baby I'm back!
New shit, the drought over, new product
Yeah, man I can't fit in with these niggaz man
I mean niggaz got mohawks, they wearin skinny jeans man
I think these niggaz is faggots man, for real man
They with the rainbow club man
You think this shit is a fad? C'mon man!
I think it's more than that man

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
They think, I'm a fool
Cause I'd do so many things, for you

Then you wan' chitter-chat, now what kind of shit is that?
Strip club, shake it shake it, toss it up, make it rain
Semi tucked, I let it buck, I shoot the shit up out your gang
Find out who you're fuckin with cause I ain't for the sucker shit
Cut you like the cocaine, niggaz stay in yo' lane
I'm a muh'fuckin heavyweight, you ain't in my weight class
And me I'm movin heavy weight, get gone with your light ass
Me I'm so official, pearl-handled nickel

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]

I come through that muh'fucker wavin the chopper
113th Precinct ain't enough to stop us
Niggaz shot at me before I got away, popped from a block away
Sucker niggaz be right there on one foot 'til I rock away
Next day I popped up, told niggaz it's my turf
They done seen the gun smoke, they done found my shells burn
Sabrina baby special, they treat me like a misfit
I squeeze {*rnnn-rnnn*} I risk it, I risk it
Different class of nigga, my hand around the trigger
Don't make me do it, I'll do it you stupid nigga

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]

Get the message, come out and get my message

[50 Cent]
I was a itty-bitty nigga when Prince killed Drake
I'm a shooter, ask Bizzy, he made us that way
I spend seven-and-a-half hours baggin up grams
Gotta watch these niggaz with the sticky-ass hands
See my face, do a hundred grams chopped on the mirror
Tell me I can't eat, I ain't tryin to hear it
JoJo wanted the bitches, I was tryin get my weight up
Nigga get in the way and get shot down, straight up
I'm grimy, yeah my friends killed my friends
Like Blackey, he did that shit to him
Get at me, I'm back strapped up again
I tried, I can't change, I'll always be the same
I tell my lil' niggaz fuck pray
And any motherfucker down with 'em can suck me - I'm still mad
I got the cream to make a murder scene
If y'all niggaz ain't shootin y'all can't fuck with me, come fuck with me

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
The D's kick my door, got knocked with a half a brick

You can't park 'round here while I'm down here
I shot Chris whip up, he came back shot Richie head
But that ain't who he aim for, get who you came for
Apollo, amateur night, your name is in lights
I don't clown, I get down, I'm a different breed
Yeah, wait until these jokers get a load of me
I watch your clique like a flick, find your backbone
Line 'em up nice, come through with the mac blowin
Beef ain't nothin new to me, it's all a repeat
I leave a shooter by your door to make your ass sleep
Now come out come out, find out what I'm about
That Ruger, that luger, I air your ass out

[Chorus]

My occupation's operation get money
Got that beam on that 9; got that money on my mind
Got no patience, man I grind like I'm runnin out of time
See the sun shine reflect off my shine, you're blind
You write hot lines like mine lines, you're signed
That bitch bad, her ass so fat class she mine
I'm addicted to it, me I got to win
Over and over and over again
This quest for the paper is never gon' end
So to my competition here's the message I send

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Man you ain't a shooter, you ain't a robber
You talk like a mobster, you fuckin blogger
I say some hard shit you wan' say somethin harder
Smack the shit out you, you wan' run to the law huh?
This movie's a rerun, you seen this before
She used a vibrator and she suck on your boy
I stand out like a sore thumb, I'm hard to ignore
You get addicted to the dick then have to go through withdrawals
After I go through the drawers, I'm back on my grizzly
Back gettin busy, causin a frenzy
It's nuttin new to me, there's nuttin they could do to me
that ain't been done to me - this is fun for me

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
One... one-two... grrrr!

I had five hundred grams and fifty in 58 bags
Fo'-hundred Benz, eight thousand in cash
Then the ball dropped, gun popped, banks got blast
I make it so hot, one shot'll melt yo' ass
Got popped up, cried 'til my eyes turned red
Then told myself in the mirror "Nigga you ain't dead"
I'm far from eccentric, I'm so psychotic
I don't need you to shoot for me, nigga I got it!
When you see me in the hood muh'fucker don't talk to me
'Less you wan' talk about usin the hawk for me
When Al blew Black away I had him on some stupid shit
Then my rap shit worked, now I'm super stupid rich
All I do is stunt now, I'm so Maybach
There I go frontin again, I meant to say laid back
Go 'head move reckless, get banged for your necklace
I serve him with the semi, feed him a clip for breakfast

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You want some? Come get some
Nigga it's murder one when I toss my gun
You might see me let it off, you might see me run
But you won't see shit time the po-lice come
Huh? You want some? Come get some
Nigga it's murder one when you see my gun
I just squeeze and squeeze 'til the whole clip done
You just bleed and bleed 'til the po-lice come
Huh? You want some?

[50 Cent]
I got a eighth of dope left, half a pound of purple
Shooters in my circle, try me I'll let 'em murk you
Got more guns than a gun store, beef ain't what you want boy
You wan' be nice to me; you wan' shoot dice with me
You want a ace on purpose, why you so nervous?
Nigga we from the same hood, we come from the same shit
You got gonorrhea too? We fucked with the same bitch
Gettin money is necessary; see me I'm a visionary
And I'm sayin that house, should be a crack house
Now see it how I see it or I'll bring the straps out
The tec and the mac out, they sick in the Taurus
The coat and that Heckler, then nigga we warrin
I let my pistols speak for me and all of 'em foreign
Click-clack, comprende? I'm criminal-minded
Toss my Nina in the sewer, bet nobody find it
'Til it's rusty and fucked up forensics have fun, what!

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Come get it, I'm strapped now, I'm wit it
Come get it - huh? You want some?
Come get it, I'm strapped now, I'm wit it
Fuck that nigga! Huh? You want some?

[Intro]
This is how monsters function

Leave me alone
I ain't fucking with nobody

[Verse]
Keep fucking with me you going turn me back to Boo Boo
Have me casing out your crib, trying to pop your fucking noodles
She was 20, I was 12, man my Nana said she raped me
I just smiled from ear to ear, saying take me baby, take me
Since high school, nigga I ain't got no friends
Got two 3-80s like the Ying Yang Twins, Ahh
That's spot clicking till the Ds run in
Then it's bail money and lawyer fees, you got to have ends
Freshman year I had that CBR Hurricane
In a ill Herringbone I got them swinging Heroine
I shoot a nigga in a heartbeat I ain't no chump
Then you can run Forrest run, retard when I dump
They take kindness for weakness, niggas don't respect that
So me I'm where that Reuger, that Pump and that Tech at
Some look at me I'm on now, I thought we was rich then
Shipment, but you had like, twenty bricks in Richmond
We was in Cocaine heaven, I was fishscale dreaming
We just got in the town, we was strapped up scheming
First Country caught a body, then Country caught a body then
I popped a couple niggas then Country shot everybody
It's cold blooded, it's real shit you got to love it
Tre-Eight Snub it, and don't think nothing of it
It's the way of the wolves, it's how they train us to move
Get it popping when we shopping niggas hold down the tools

[Chorus]
I seen niggaz getting rich
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I was tired of not having shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I seen niggaz getting hit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
We was slinging that shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
Here I am

[Verse] 
Unsure since we was little niggas, son since we were seven
Armed robbery, first degree, my man did seven
Niggas popped his whip up, hit his Camry with a seven
He a lucky muhfucker I bet he make it to heaven
My Grandpa drunk, my uncle Rock drunk
My uncle Champ pump crack, smoked my fucking stash up
I had 250 grams stashed on the porch
I mean, how much you going to smoke, man? how much you going to snort?
First the VCR went, then the TV went
He stole out of mommy purse, she thought it was me, kid
I ain't ask her for no money son cause I was out hustling
She was looking at me sideways like I'm a thief or something
That hurt me, come on son that wouldn't hurt you?
I pistol whip that nigga till his face was purple
I need anger management, see I hold on to a grudge
The same way I hold on to that nickel-plate Snub

[Bridge]
The Lord don't have imperfections baby
So I think I'm perfect the way he made me
Some say I'm cool, some say I'm crazy
Some say I ain't shit, some say I'm amazing

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Dre, niggas think we're bullshitting

[Chorus]
Nigga try me son, he best have the heat on him
Want my eyes closed, get to mopping the street with him
Boy I put your body in a bag, front on me, I'm on ya ass
I bring money to my niggas, that bring death to my enemies
I bring money to my niggas, that bring death to my enemies

[Verse 1]
Nigga front on me, the goons and goblins come out
Wishmaster hundred shot drums will run out
They dumb out, you heard of me, they call me big homie
Me, I make the register ring, I'm the cash cow
They make the hammers ring, you on your ass now
Hair trigger, stare nigga, yeah niggas'll flip
Six to a semi assault, let it off at your will
Here I is, where the money is, I still get biz
D's know about the beef, you going to still get did
It be your tombstone and your fucking grave they dig
Have that ass in the precinct trying to talk to the pigs
I'm like Damien nigga, when I start getting loose on you
Closest thing to Lucifer, you think you got a noose on you
I make it hard to breathe
I come where your hustle, air it out, make it hard to eat
Have you looking both ways like you crossing the street

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Niggas send me the wrong message, we going fucking kill the messenger
Your whole clique, hollow tips will tear up the best of you
This ain't +Tha Carter+ nigga, this is Sparta
It's harder, I die and be a martyr, respect me like your father
Let off a clip or let a case off
I have your pussy ass running like a race horse
Follow orders now, Yay shoot his face off
You can have one, blast one, it's mad fun
See how when you listen to me all of the cash come
I was born with the Tec, it's a birth defect
I was conceived in the bins, ended up in a Benz
This is what happens when have-nots turn into sasquatch
Let the gat pop, boogie down on the back blocks
It's horrific, nah it's terrific
I got it if you sniff it, go head nigga twist it
Get lifted, goddamn I'm gifted

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I tell them ride on them, then they ride on them
Get the line on them then squeeze the .9 on them
Head shot, .40 glock, blow his mind on him
They say ain't not a jooks, leave his shines on his
Now you can watch me, nigga like the police watch me
I move proper, go ahead catch a shell trying to stop me
That 4-30 Spider, carbon fibre
And my dog is like Al Qaeda, natural fighter
Rapid fire, you're sweet like apple cider
The Mack will fire, mask like Michael Myers
It's off the wire when I get on my bullshit
No smiles, no laughs, you gets no pass
You can explain to my niggas while they whoop your ass
My hands itch when the money comes, it's hard to explain it
Last time I itched like this a truckload came in
Get money, get bread, that's what I do kid

[Chorus]

[Intro]
I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful

[Verse One]
Your daddy fucked your mama then fucked your sister
Then climbed in the bed playin with your sugar
Go 'head, take your belt off and hang yourself
Matter a fact grab your strap and bang yourself
Jay's a big man, he's too big to respond
I'm a big dick you know the one everybody's on
You 'gon make me sing Murder Was The Case
Pull this richter shit PING PING should you start to face
I'm international I'm never home mayne!!!
I've been gone so long my accent changed
You better watch who you fuck with mate
Or you 'gon make me carve your ass up now straight
Come on Game you will never be my equal!
Your homies shoot, doors my niggas shoot people!
See me I'm what you never 'gon be
I'm in that tax bracket you never 'gon see

[Chorus]
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful

[Verse Two]
That nigga Buck a fiend, tell momma he done smoked the TV
I ain't know he fucked with more dope than B.G.
Plus a nigga sipped more syrup than Pepsi
Man keepin these muthafuckers rich ain't easy
Especially when a nigga wanna stunt like Jeezy
And his CDs' didn't sell like his CDs'
Man, that nigga blew all of his chips on dem breezies
Mad 'cause the world won't treat him like Weezy
Look I don't give a FUCK, nigga please believe me
No nigga in no vocal booth around can see me
It's crazy how I make this shit look oh so easy
They say, "50, naw I don't fuck wit him, he oh so greasy
Yeah, he used to share that paper now he oh so greedy"
It's funny how they shit on niggas, then they need me
See me I'm number one, I'm loadin up my gun
I catch ya if you done, you pussy nigga run

[Chorus]
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful

[Verse Three]
They say first comes love, then comes marriage
Instead I got Shanequa in a baby carriage
Then came the cash then the baby mama drama
I gave that bitch a half a mill she blew it on Prada
I remember when I met the bitch and she ain't have nada
Got my son on some fly shit, now I gotta buy shit
Man I can't even flaunt shit cause everybody want shit
Everybody mad, DAMN even my dad
And I don't even know him now how the fuck I owe him?!
I ain't given nobody shit I'm a show them
I gave Game hits and told me to suck dick
Start screamin Westside and Dre ain't say shit!!!
Now we just eat off him, and when I talk to Em
A smile comes on his face, he told me here's the case
Enemies stay enemies but friends they change
Niggas go crazy over money my mayne!!!!

[Chorus]
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Eminem]
You see I'm a psycho (Psycho) A sicko (A sicko) I'm crazy (I'm crazy)
I said I got my knife boy (Knife boy)
I'll kill you (I'll kill you) If you make me (If you make me)
They wanna see my shot up (Shot up)
Locked up (Locked up) Then cage me (Then cage me)
I come back bigger (Bigger) Stronger
(Stronger) And angry (And angry)

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
Yeah! Look look I come from a different crew you fuck with me I'll get to you
A clip or two I'll cripple you just cause I ain't got shit to do
Pistol pop a pussy drop, drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie mini moe, Nine, Trey pound or Forty fo'
Pick a strap then take the Mac the Hawk I stab it in your back
I'll blow your brains I know your name and where you rest I make a mess
The hollow tips will hit your chest you cough up blood till EMS
Come pick you up you know your fucked when you get on the stretcher
Cause I come into ICU to see you off to Heaven
The system I done been through it there's nothin new done to me
They lock me up they let me out you seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals while they up in corrections
They come home get a Nine then commit crime in perfection
It's murder one they found a gun now they doin ballistics
But they can't find a fingerprint the shit's goin terrific
Get so close on your target that it's really hard to miss it 

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Eminem]
Man these are average raps, I'm keepin the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath clique
You pop off the top, it's like openin vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch yeah there's somethin to jack a batch in
Impregnated then chewed up the embryo sack with Mac-10s'
Triplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins
That fetus is fallin out all over, Jack is back again
The Ripper's at your service, girl I can see that you're nervous
But I barely scratch the surface, llke my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fuckin backyard, still tryin to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out?
It's past your curfew when it's dark, I'm searchin for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop
'Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI, they hate us but they gotta give a lot of props
The drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

[Verse Three: Eminem]
Yeah, I'm as ill as can be
My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me
Killin' so villainously
Still as maniacal on the night goin psycho as Michael Myers 
You know what we're like on the muthafuckin mic, so try us 
and you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers

[Verse Four: 50 Cent]
It's operation time they got him hooked up the wires
Squeezin me bleedin wheezin breathin he half dead
He must ain't know but now he know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Led showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn!!!
School of arts, truly y'all, you better learn learn!!!

[Verse Five: Eminem]
Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah homie, turn turn
I'm debatin, mutilatin the lady
You've been waitin for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicatin it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her, I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's I squashed her
I put her on the ringer and hung her over the wash tub

[Verse Six: 50 Cent]
When I'm through with Ricky It'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk witness this shit end up nautious
Look deep in my eye see many many men die
I swing gemstars faster than Samurai

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama, you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me
Down

[Verse 1]
Through every altercation
I put no one above you, MM-MM I love you
They shook up when we jooks 'em
You see how they be lookin'
It's frightening like lightning
You crack off, they start bookin'
It's beef until I get out
In broad day with my shit out
That's when they say I'm illin'
And when she get to killin'
Now my baby she precious
I warn you not to test this
I aim her at your head nigga
Motherfuck the vestes
I'm antisocial, quit acting like you know me
Before I go postal, you know I gotta owe me
I'm ridin' with her ol' cocked
Audi R8 drop
Feel the wind blow
Twist the indo
Smoke it up, it's fundamental
You can't get to her, poke 'em up
When we get intimate
That's when I get into shit
She 32 I'm 34, I fuck her raw
She revolve 6 times then I feed her more

[Chorus]
I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama, you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me
Down

[Verse 2]
When niggas get to trippin'
I need you by my side, yeah, so they can't catch me slippin'
I take you out shoppin',
Get you clean, get it poppin'
Use my finger, get ya hot girl
I know your spot, yeah
I love you if you love me back
You never jam when I react
To sucka shit
When they get hit
And we take off
If you get tossed
I'll be back
I want you so I'll be back
I'll never change

A nigga stunt I let it rain

I'll hit you up you think I'm playin'
I be strapped
Go 'head fuck around, I be strapped
24/7
I'm back holdin', mistake me for a chump
Bite off more than you can chew, more beef than you want
Come through repeatedly, show you what bananas about
I'm a mechanic, find out when the hammers come out

[Chorus]
I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama, you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me
Down

Your favorite bad guy's gone, the Joker's dead
So from now until forever you're stuck with the kid
I ain't supposed to be a boss, I'm supposed to be an enforcer
I'm supposed to hold a gun, not be stuck in the office
Michael pimped me? I was in the passenger seat
He was comfortable with me 'round cause I blast my heat
'9-4 I was tryin to catch Mason for bricks of raw
Charlie fucked up the jux, they took Nana's little boy - streeeeetch
The cocaine, I go hard when the drought come
When the straps come out son niggaz know the outcome
Lay low, stay low, you may see Jesus
Get hit with a stray yo for no fuckin reason
You prayin for a Benz, it's a blessin you breathin
It's a miracle that God gave me this tec, now I'm eatin

In different boroughs I have different moments
On different days niggas know how I'm on it
I'm pretty like a Harlem nigga, I'm a shooter like a Brooklyn nigga
I'm a hustler don't get no bigger

Now one's a fuckin junkie, and one's a fuckin queer
Now it's three of us, that's the way we started

Wrists rocked up shinin, flawless diamonds
You could hardly see the face on my Audemar time and
On that J.T. shit, me I'm bringin +Sexy Back+
Louis belt wrapped around right where the tec be at

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Gettin paper's my objective, yup, now your chain gone
One false move and CLAP, now your brain's gone
You like me, you aight with me; me? I'm into me
I destroy my enemies, even if they're kin to me
Do 'em like the Kennedy's, ching-ching that's mo' bread
Say somethin slick out yo' mouth I'll come for yo' head
She likes me more than you can imagine
Bad bitch, look like she fell up out a pageant
Closest I'ma get to heaven in this lifetime
is right below her waist, in between her thighs
Call her Pussycat, that's my nickname for her
And I ain't got to buy shit or run game on her
See when I stunt she stunt, we stunt together
Oh you don't like how that sound? Aw nigga whatever
We both rock Bugarri, both push Ferraris
I go so hard in the paint, I'm sorry!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
You want me? I want you
Plug one? Plug two
I'm infinitely special, girl the Lord's gonna bless you
if you do what I tell you to do
You want me? I want you
You want Benz? I'll buy two
You should want me like you want success
Girl with us together we'll be better than the best
Why settle for less?

[Chorus]

Girl I want you to give me what you got and give me more
Girl you can start on top or on fours
You know I like it, when you get into it
Don't nobody do it, uh, like I do it
Feel the rush, from my touch, get intoxicated
Drunk off my love, call the Hennesey thug
Passion, ya laughin, I can make you smile on the regular
Tell me what you want, shorty, that's what I'ma get ya
Yeah, I need you to be what I need, more than liquor or weed
I need you to maybe give me a seed
I need you to give me reason to breathe
I need you, I'm tellin this so you know what I need 
I'd be a part-time or full-time lovers, a meant-to-be lover 
Don't matter which way it go, I'm oh so gutta 
Girl you could get it however you wan' get it

"D-D-Do you, do-do, do you think about me?"
"Do you, do you, do you think about me?"
"Do you think, do you think, do-do-do you think about me?"
"Do you, do you, do you, do you think about me?"

[50 Cent]
Uhh, yeah
You think about money when you think about me, huh?
It's why my ex my ex, you don't wan' be her
She used to have the Beemer, now she own a sneaker
I had her eatin lobster, now she eatin pizza
I think about Easter when I think about Keyshia
Shorty stay fly, that's why I keep her
Round like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa
She good if I leave her, she got her own Visa
Think about them when you think about frontin
Think about stuntin when you think about me
I'm the boss, Bentley or the Porsche?
Overseas see jet skis slide across
I love the way you dress, now take it off
Put your legs high on my shoulders of course
I'm racin through your mind, but you already lost
I'm at the finish line, and you're a friend of mine
C'mon let's ride

[Chorus: Governor]
{"Do you think about me?"}
Just a little bit, every now and then
{"Do you think about me?"}
Goddamn girl! We used to be friends
{"Do you think about me?"}
Just a little bit, just a little bit
{"Do you think about me?"}
Just a little bit, just a little bit!
{"Do you think about me?"}

[50 Cent]
I think like a hustler, I'm thinkin 'bout a shipment
She thinkin I'm her hustler, she thinkin 'bout commitment
It's like Paul McCartney's stuck in my head
He fell in love with one bitch who walked away on one leg
She ain't even have to run to get away with the bread
That's some fucked up shit, think about that kid
I'm thinkin "What this bitch thinkin when she take me to court?
I pay my child support, what the fuck she want?"
This relationship shit is too much for me
I wanna fuck, be friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow mines on shoppin sprees
She should have what she want, just not from me
I'm thinkin 'bout my future, she brought up my past
She don't care about me, she just want some cash
I'm thinkin damn, girl we used to be friends
How did shit become all about ends?

[Chorus]

[Governor]
(Do you think about meeeee?) Do you think about me?
(I know you think about meeeee)
You GOT to remember all the good times we had!
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit!
(Oooooooooooooh, do you think about meeeee?)
I remember when you told me
(I know you think about meeeee)
That I'll ALWAYYYYYS be special to you darlin
You were so special to me, do you think about me?
Ohhh

[Interlude]

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah! 50! 

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
I gave her books to read, fed her mind with knowledge
Gave her street smarts, shit you can't get in college
She's a reflection of me, 'til you know she the shit
If I'm a star she a star, If I'm rich she rich
That's my dog, I tell her stay she wanna go
I tell her go she wanna stay
That's my dog, you a bitch don't usually mean nothin to me, that's right
But that's my dog I go left, she go right, I go up, she go down
She couldn't listen that, she ain't around
So ungrateful, screamin I hate you, she must got amnesia, bitch I made you
Now, just think, just think that could've been you
Just think, that should've been you
Yeah, wit me, I share the world with you
But you ain't ride with a rider so I ain't fuckin with you

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Say, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, gooooo!!
The reason you didn't get dick
because you got your nose up your ass like your smellin your shit
But tonight you met your match (WHOOOOOA OHHHHHH WHYYYYYY!!!)
Cause I be smellin my shit too now how you like that?!
You could've had this dude and anything you choose 
And now girl you lose cause I ain't fuckin with ya
(Could've been you!!!) Shoppin sprees, drop top hair blowin in the wind
(Could've been you!!!) Livin lavish instead it's your girlfriend
But you trippin, while we sippin, in the back of the club big tippin!!

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Some say it hurts when you supposed to win, then you lose
You were supposed to be sure, baby you was confused
I had a thang for ya, I had a ring for ya
House, cars, kids and a pet, and name for ya
Pussycat told ya I make it, you ain't believe
I guess 'cause comin up was hard, it was easy to leave
Now think about it, maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Either way shorty, life goes on (For sure!)
When you around, my smile's a grin, my thoughts are a sin
You ask me can we try again, I ain't fuckin witchu (Naw!)
It's on, the club jumpin, I'm tryna get my liquor and
You wanna suck the dick again, I'm starin at your thicker friends (Wassup ma?)
I guess I'm like Will Smith in "Pursuit of Happyness"
In my hood, we all hustle and in pursuit of the same shit
Now just think (Just think) That could've been you
Now just think that should've been you, with me
I share the world witchu,
but you ain't ride with a rider, so I ain't fuckin witchu

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Say, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, gooooo!!
The reason you didn't get dick
because you got your nose up your ass like your smellin your shit
But tonight you met your match (WHOOOOOA OHHHHHH WHYYYYYY!!!)
Cause I be smellin my shit too nut how you like that?!
You could've had this dude and anything you choose 
And now girl you lose cause I ain't fuckin with ya
(Could've been you!!!) Shoppin sprees, drop top hair blowin in the wind
(Could've been you!!!) Livin lavish instead it's your girlfriend
And it ain't no other way to put it except
I know you understand it girl it's so...
But you see us in the back of the club
poppin bottles and it could've been you, but nope!!!!

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Said it could've been......could've been you yeah!!!!!!
Said it could've been......It could've been yooouuuuuuuu!!!!!

[Intro]
From the day you're born, 'til the day you die...
If you're one of the poor ones you just gotta work hard

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
One-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven
Departure from the hood, destination hell or heaven
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider
I'm a rider, say I'm a rider

[50 Cent]
They puttin pressure on me son now they want me to snap
End up like X and Whitney in my mansion smokin crack
I'm paranoid, I'm feelin like niggaz is tryin to get me
Forget the kids I'm shavin off my fuckin head like Britney
Man Dre won't mix my records now I need to talk to Jimmy
I'm fallin back in my old ways I'm ridin with the semi
Who's callin me? It's Chris he's on the other line with Diddy
But I don't wanna talk right now, my day is goin shitty
Why's Jay rockin that Urkel look, man isn't he from Marcy?
They say he's growin dreads and now he's talkin like a Yardi
Man everything is changin, I don't understand a thing
I guess this is that bullshit that all the money brings
I'm on flight

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
My baby mama boyfriend like to talk like he can hurt me
I'm laughin cause she kissed him in his mouth and gave him herpes
That just makes him one of 50 niggaz wantin to murk me
Niggaz found my truck and burnt it up out there in Jersey
You can ask my son, he'll tell you "My dad's fuckin crazy
She filled his head with shit and now I think he fuckin hates me"
Shady didn't invent me but a star is what he made me
I'll blow your fuckin mind out if I told you what he paid me
He gave me all the pills he had left, that's why I'm so high
It makes me feel so good now that I'm not so scared to die
I wish a nigga would, I dare a motherfucker try
You get at me and miss you kiss yo' black ass good-bye
I'm on flight

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
My lawyers all contained cause every month I give 'em stacks
In case they wanna send me up for murder like Max
Man I wasn't the shooter, I was never on the scene
So if they do forensics they'll find out it wasn't me
There's no need for a lie detector, I ain't sayin shit
The more you talk the higher chances you're doin a bid
Today I read the paper, it said Tru Life caught a case
They said they found a victim with a knife stuck in his face
I spoke to Michael Vick, I told him I'm happy he home
You tell them crackers sorry nigga then you get back on
When dogs are fightin in the hood nobody gives a fuck
So you get back and shake it on the field, show them what's up
I'm on flight

[Chorus]

[Intro: sample of 50 Cent's "I Get Money"]

Shawty said take it off, I'll take it off
Climb right out of my clothes
Want me to break you off, I'll break you off
'Til your love come down on yo' walls
I'm extremely focused, sweatin I'm strokin
I better get you open
I'll leave your headboard broken, you think I'm jokin
I bet I'll get you open

[50 Cent]
First it's her neck, yeah then her back
Yeah I'm a freak, I get into all that

Switch gears slow down, go down whoa now
You can feel every inch of it when we intimate
I'll use my tongue baby, I'll leave you sprung maybe
I'll have ya head spinnin sayin "50's so crazy"

Ha ha! Said what you sayin boy, boy? (boy)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
See, the weak get walked on, the soft get barked on
See me, I never ever ever runnnn
Niggaz say the wrong shit to me, like he wan' do me
Somebody lead him with my gunnnn

Watch your mouth girl, this a man's world
What you sayin boy? You think I'm playin boy?

[50 Cent]
Listen nigga you play me, and I'ma go crazy
You push me I'ma motherfuckin trip
I come trippin through yo' set, bustin off my tec
I gives a fuck if you's a Blood or a Crip
Nigga from J.F.K. to L.A.X. I'm back through the sets again
Gangsta life that's right, crazy-ass Mexicans
Do it the raw way, broad day, AK
Spray cause a melee, mayday mayday!
Freak bitch suck me on tape like Ray J
Niggaz that I'm up against know they can't fade me
I'm the last one, you know the last don
She know she wan' come, bitch bring ya ass on!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
See I come from the Southside where niggaz is outside
Right now with the rubber grips
Niggaz say they gon' see me, to hit 'em on G.P.
Then I bless 'em with the chains full of bricks
When you come from where I'm from, you come from the bottom
They ain't supposed to get this rich
So the Fed's got my phone tapped to treat me like Fat Cat
Now I'm thinkin "Man ain't this a bitch!"
Niggaz stick cola in cola, from movin the yola
Next thing you know they up in yo' crib
Sayin where's the stash at? You move they gon' blast that
So I suggest you stand still kid

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
This a man's world...
Watch your mouth girl, this a man's world

[Intro: skit]
"Police search for clues on the Q-111 bus where two people were shot, one fatally."
  "We heard like a few shots ring out, and uh, you know 
   by living in neighborhoods, familiar with those sounds we knew it was gunshots.
   So automatically y'know we start taking cover 
   cause we didn't know which direction they were coming from."
"Police say it all started in South Jamaica about 2-and-a-half miles 
 away from the shooting on the bus at Jamaica Station."
   "I was trying to get away from the area, after the first shot.
    It was very traumatizing to me, like I've seen this happen a lot of times.
    Didn't wanna be involved.
    I did not wanna be, that person that get a stray bullet or nothing like that."
"Police have arrested a 34 year-old man.
 They believe he is responsible for both shooting incidents.
 They also recovered a handgun.
 He was arrested not far from here near Jamaica Station.
 In Jamaica Queens, Zack Fink, New York 1."

[50 Cent]
It's "The Big 10"
It's, it's been ten years since "50 Cent is the Future"
Psh, I'm tired as a muh'fucker man

{"What you want me to be, I've tried to see"}

[50 Cent]
Yeah bitch I got my second wind, you could pretend I ain't the shit
I'm guilty I'm guilty, yeah I'm filthy fuckin rich
I'm strapped Your Honor, new mac, my armor
Point blank, matchin my bullet-proof persona
New version of Dahmer, pussy-eatin piranha
My tongue touch her flesh, your bitches say I'm the best
Them crackers say I'm racial, wait a cotton-pickin minute!
Now I'm racial, cause I done put "cotton-pickin" in it
Put a knot on your fuckin head, yeah that'll happen first
I'll put a dot on your fuckin head, you end up in a hearse
They say I play mind games, warrior mindframe
These bitch niggaz, always forget to say my name
Go 'head, I want you to, you four, I'm onto you
I'm so strategic you wouldn't believe it
And they know it, every time I come around
Pit stop and they tend to quiet down
Gotta know about me

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
My nine got a extended clip on it
My Tec got all kinda shit on it
Inf' beam, hollow tips, rubber grip on it
Night vision through the sight when I grip on it
My nine got a extended clip on it
My Tec got all kinda shit on it
My pound got a body on it, body on it
My man put a body on it, body on it

[50 Cent]
I read a blog
They said I ain't got it, I still got it, oh Lord
Look who's gonna meet the edge of my sword
I'm takin off now bitch, all aboard
If you wanna ride; fuck it, let's ride
It seems like, principle livin's startin to fade
Even in a gangsta's life, niggaz is snakes
No loyalty, rats rattin on members of their gang
Funny they were family before the pigs came

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah~! This one right here marks the decade of hot shit
If a nigga say I fell off, all I want you to do is ask him when
What they gon' say, what, the "Curtis" album?
Okay so #1's not good enough
I gave you "Ayo Technology" that was #1
"I Get Money," that wasn't hot?
So tell me when I fell off? Yeah
When I gave you motherfuckers what you asked for, with "Before I Self Destruct"
you looked at me and was like, 'We cool Fif'!'
You know why? Cause I won too much in front of you niggaz
That's why, but it's cool
I take a break, I come back, so hot you can't deny it
It's your boy 50
This one right here is for the haters, for real
I want you to eat a dick; don't suck a dick, eat a dick
Chew it, hahahaha

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Kidd Kidd)
Niggas be schemin, fiendin
They cut your jooks, they off the hook, I come through there look how they look
I'm ridin leanin, they dreamin they do me dirty
If they could I'm lookin like I wish you would
(Try me, go 'head, try me) Niggas be schemin, dreamin
(Try me have you hooked to I-V) Niggas be schemin, dreamin

[Verse One: Kidd Kidd]
Mad niggaz wan' do me dirty, I'm fresh out the tub
You move like a snail you deserve to catch a slug
Man I wake up huggin my bitch
One with the extended clip, not the one that I'm with (uh)
If you all made men then you know shit real
They got change on the mic, I ain't tryin to see 'em killed
I told 'em that's my cuz, I don't wanna see nothin happen to him
Cuase when I start spittin at him I ain't rappin to him
Yeah I'm jumpin in that water like a diver
Six shot survivors, school of hard knock scholars
These niggaz ain't riders, they hiders, they cowards
I feel like 50, hold +Power of a Dollar+
I told my nigga give me one of them bullet-proof trucks
I want you dumb enough to try and shoot it up
I'm lookin at the nigga lettin off
Wait until you finish the clip, laugh then pulled off
Huh~!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Kidd Kidd)
Niggas be schemin, fiendin
They cut your jooks, they off the hook, I come through there look how they look
I'm ridin leanin, they dreamin they do me dirty
If they could I'm lookin like I wish you would
(Try me, go 'head, try me) Niggas be schemin, dreamin
(Try me have you hooked to I-V) Niggas be schemin, dreamin

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
It sounds like a nightmare, I graduated from fightin
Play the projects faster than the third of two man indictments
See my baby blue Ferrari make 'em feel like the virus
In they stomach, I keep it one hundred I make 'em vomit
I got a code name for straps, the sacks in the trumpet
I get the blowin, ya ears will ring for days when I dump it
My bullet wounds call them beauty marks and my hole we don't talk to narcs
So the first forty eight the clock tickin the plot thickens
The charge cocaine possession I'm creepin with a firearm
The D's don't even wanna see me, with a firearm
Before I go back again I'm a let it off
They ain't got to pop first, fuck that I'm a set it off
I need a mental eval, something's wrong with my brainwaves
I'm rich as a motherfucker still ridin with a AK 
Picture me comin through lettin a nigga play me
When I got all this bread, bitch it's off with ya head...asap!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Kidd Kidd)
Niggas be schemin, fiendin
They cut your jooks, they off the hook, I come through there look how they look
I'm ridin leanin, they dreamin they do me dirty
If they could I'm lookin like I wish you would
(Try me, go 'head, try me) Niggas be schemin, dreamin
(Try me have you hooked to I-V) Niggas be schemin, dreamin  

[Verse Three: Kidd Kidd]
I had to be slippin to let this clown hit me up
Now I got to walk around with this shit bag for months
Now I don't give a fuck 'bout a bitch or a nigga
Startin to treat my own brothers like they just another nigga
My click got smaller and my clips got bigger
Condom on my heart, motherfuck your feelings
They call me Superman see I ain't 'posed to walk
Better watch how you talk or get popped like a cork, off

[Verse Four: 50 Cent]
See they ain't real as they seem and they schemin
They fiendin and dreamin, they geekin and creepin
They hear tires screechin, infrared beamin
Niggaz head leakin, what the fuck was he thinkin?
Sounds of police, momma signin new leases
You know you got to relocate her when you beefin
I guess you're here for a real reason
Rah got hit like he got hit but he ain't fuckin breathin, uhh!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Kidd Kidd)
Niggas be schemin, fiendin
They cut your jooks, they off the hook, I come through there look how they look
I'm ridin leanin, they dreamin they do me dirty
If they could I'm lookin like I wish you would
(Try me, go 'head, try me) Niggas be schemin, dreamin
(Try me have you hooked to I-V) Niggas be schemin, dreamin

[Verse One: Paris]
I, string 'em along on some acoustic guitar shit
Tell 'em park it, front of Neiman Marcus
(Badly Neishka)  I need that, I need that
(Armando Castilo) I need that, I need that
Said we gon' chill, where the weed that? The weed at?
Said you got a Spider, where them keys at? Them keys at?
Lit it on 'em, shitted on 'em, torture
I'm hotter than a sauna, pull up in a Zonda
Calm yourself 'fore you get dealt with
Have the medics workin on your pelvis
T.O.A., there's nothin left to say
Went down like a hourglass; Paris first class
Regardless, fake bitches not responsive
Me I'm in the streets rockin a piece that's retarded
In the diamond district with Jacob
Makin all you little clones wanna save up

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
We come from Queens where we are taught to handle beef on our own (OH!)

Where Brooklyn at?! Where The Bronx at?! Where Harlem at?! Where Yonkers at?! (OH!)

[Verse Two: Paris]
All my men is caked up, stingy with the snatch
'Cause niggas get too attached, sleep with the rat-chet 
Under the mattress, natural
My cat got a got a five o'clock shadow, it don't matter
'Cause niggas is still badder your chicks is gettin fucked
I'm on top, that's how I rock luxury every stop
Eat it or beat it you should already know
My friend you're not needed, next nigga RE-MIX!!!
Word to ev'rything, on some g shit
Fuck with me, give me a reason

Heh! Your now rockin with the best mama
Bombshell hood hottie unit A shell Bugati OH!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

[Verse Three: 50 Cent]
Queens will ease on 'em, squeeze on 'em
We'll dump the two two three's on 'em
Breeze on 'em lit the trees on 'em
And the bandana make 'em think it's gang related
We on that gritty shit the city shit, New York, New York
You come through on some pretty shit get outlined and chalked
I get busy I get busy I'm strapped now
I'm tryin to say I want you motherfuckers to act out
I'll have that ass sprint towards the door when I back out
Don't do it don't you do it, dow-dow-down make me stick to you
Holey moley the roley icey always perpetual
Diamonds blinkin like hazards take a look at it
I'm a regular badman they say I'm a madman
Fuck a mask and gloves, I let it off bare hand
We come from a warzone them Southside streets
Where anything and everything get done to eat  

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
We come from Queens where we are taught to handle beef on our own (OH!)
You call the cops we get it poppin we be out with the chrome (OH!)
Where Brooklyn at?! Where The Bronx at?! Where Harlem at?! Where Staten at?! (OH!)
Where Brooklyn at?! Where The Bronx at?! Where Harlem at?! Where Yonkers at?! (OH!)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I don't wanna love....you

[Verse Three: 50 Cent]
I don't want a relationship I just want to have fun
In every position we can't come up until were done
At my request is to kick that shit in my ear
Like to hear what your thinkin after laughin and drinkin
Though we can have a ball, yeah we can do it all
Moon shine, light up the sky at nighttime 
With me, any time could be the right time
I'm sort of impulsive, I'm kind of explosive
Me, just take a little at a time in doses
Don't want you addicted, I just wanna kick it
You could pick the spot I'll be there with the greatness
Give it to you good when I'm gone I'm sure you 'gon miss this

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I don't wanna love....you
I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out

Nothing is quite as it seems
Fuck with me and you will see

[Interlude]
Shoot your gun I'll make you a believerrrrr
Now you better pray for something morrrrre

[50 Cent]
I go to war to my house, stuntin niggaz ain't listenin
Get to thumpin and to dumpin at your newborn's christenin
Tell your homie tell his homies he gon' need more homies
Ain't this a bitch, I got that extended clip right on me
And my diamonds on my neck, I dare a nigga to scheme on it
That Ruger on deck, it's hard to miss with the beam on it
I'll give ya ass a permanent nap, sing you a lullaby
I got money to run, so fuck a alibi

[Interlude]

[50 Cent]
Yeah, I believe you when you say you tough nigga
All that means is you fucked nigga
I get the drop I'm on it
Morning noon and night, I spot ya, I got ya
Wake up cuffed to your bed, cops askin who shot ya
As the world turns, {?} we learned that hollow tips burn and I ain't concerned
If I ain't hit then I ain't hit so a nigga don't really give a shit
You know who you're fuckin with, come through dump more than a clip
Niggaz be on some stupid shit, 'til you get hit, ain't that a bitch?

[Kidd Kidd]
Uhh, K-I-double, shotgun barrel double
My homies run a couple and I move 'em on the double
Racks in the duffle, mac with the muzzle
Make me circle you in all black like a tunnel
I only know how to hustle, can't stay out of trouble
I got a big gun, motherfuck a scuffle
"Kidd Kidd, will you ever change?" Fuck no~!
Pimp zone, rider gang, you already fuckin know

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Kidd Kidd]
Man, these niggaz so fake I call 'em knock offs

You ain't hot dog, you the fuckin Mickie Mouse soft
I'm on fire like Louisiana hot sauce
Brand new J's cost a buck-fifty nigga
You scuff these I'll skull your face buck-fifty nigga
Been fuckin with them pigs, you a guinea nigga
And you always big and you a skinny nigga
I wear my gun like it's trendy nigga
You pussy and ain't shit, kitty litter
Uh, see where all that bitchin get ya?

Uhh, all I do is this
Stunt when I want, and rock newer shit

I'm super rich like Russell, naw Lyor

She's spoiled, she want it she can have that
Your bitch cool, but where her Birkin bag at?
You could tell a lot about a nigga by his bitch
Be my guest, look at mine, I'm the shit
I'm hot, my shit bump coast to coast, don't it?
I get bread, my watch I blew a loaf on it
Get caught starin at that get smoked for it
Fool, my swag unlimited
So fly ain't shit I can't buy
Louboutin kicks; my Louboutin bitch
Fresh off the runway, get you one one day
Catch me in Milan, tuxedo on
The Black James Bond, nigga I'm a don
I do what I want, when and where I want

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Put yo' hands up (put 'em up)
High where my eyes could see (what's up)
You know you wanna party with me (let's fuck)
We whylin in the place to be - bitch quit playin
Put yo' hands up (put 'em up)
High where my eyes could see (what's up)
You know you wanna party with me (let's fuck)
We whylin in the place to be - nigga quit playin

[50 Cent]
Catch me ridin solo, Purple Label polo
Paparazz' photo, my side bitch in Manolo
It's all about dough though, my knuckle game like Cotto
Plus I get to shootin but keep that on the low though
Ay~! Nigga I ain't really got to talk about it
Me I get paper, moves I make major
Shoes I rock gator, wing tips playa
My style so pure, I'm so couture
I'm down by law, certified B-boy
Hold up, wait a minute - money I'm gon' spend it
Or why the fuck would I hustle hard to get it?
So many flows the hoes be on the diddick
And when they pop it and lock it they know I'm wit it
"Dame lingua," give me tongue while I hit it
She a star, fresh from P.R.
Give me more, baby give me more

[Chorus]

[Intro: 50 Cent - singing]
If you think you're lonely now
Wait until tonight, girl (ahh man)
If you think you're lonely now (it's goin down tonight baby)
Wait until tonight

[50 Cent]
I'm waitin on you to cum/come baby I'm that man
Bedroom superhero, naked I'm Batman
I kill it then I'll give ya mouth-to-mouth CPR
Bring ya back to life - climax, start your afterlife
Bounce up and down on my love, this is chronic
Have it how ya want it, my backshot's bionic
She +Givin Me Somethin I Could Feel+ like En Vogue
Unload then reload, recharge, I'm back hard
Get back at it, fuckin up the springs in her Craftmatic
Jackrabbit addiction, I don't wanna break that habit
Your boy toy, man-child, it's cool you could play with me
City life, bright lights, tonight you could stay with me
I wan' share thoughts, let's talk, go for a walk (woo!)
Fantasies, we can get loose right in the park (woo!)
Bull's-eye right through her head to her heart
It's mental and physical; when you're gone I'll be missin you

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You gon' get it, you gon' get it, I got a plan for you (I got it all planned out girl)
Girl it's on 'til the morn' when you come through (ha ha!)
I can't think of a thing now that I won't do (what you wan' do?)
When you come and I get, my hands on you (wait 'til I get you girl)

[50 Cent]
I'm Curtis Mayfield, Marvin, the new Bobby Womack
2012 freak shit, baby I'm all that
The touchin and the teasin, the pleasure's the reason
I'm sure she'll be open from the lickin and strokin
Or how I say a line that stimulates her mind
My sense of humor make her smile while passin time
It's sexual, it's not perverted or obscene
The foreplay we play until I touch her and she cream
Cash rules the shorty, she's somethin out a dream
Half J-Lo, half Jessica Biel, she in between
Got the island girl swag, she dutty wine
But when we get back to the spot, that ass is mine
See how I switch gears? Her bra gone, it's on
It's showtime, yeah it's my turn to perform
Leave the lights on, while I get it I got it good
She's sayin she love my show and I'm thinkin I knew she would

[Chorus]

"So tonight, I wanna talk to you about the relationship
 between money and peace.
 A lot of other people say it's not about money.
 It's about peace, and it's about joy, and it's about love.
 It's about money, it's about money, it's about money."

[50 Cent along with sample]
You took my heart... right outta me
And tore it... in a million pieces

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You took my heart, from me
I'll never be, the same
Now killin won't be hard, for me
Cause I can't, feel, a thang

[50 - over Chorus]
Man I don't give a fuck, I don't wanna hear nothin
Y'all niggaz, man
What? What the fuck is you lookin at?
Oh you tough? Oh, oh he a tough nigga
Go get my straps man, get the straps

[50 Cent]
Sunday morning, preacher in the pulpit
Kiss my nana, I can't listen to this bullshit
It's all good 'til he askin for an offerin
All we got is pain, so that's all I could offer him
My momma cold, she brought me in this cold world
And left me - what I got to protect me?
Oh I got a nine, yeah I got a nine
And all this ambition, bitch I'm on the grind
Sky's the limit; two for five's the gimmick
You line some'n up, I'll tie some'n up
Then run up out that crib with that money nigga what
School of hard knocks, I'm ahead of my class
With no hesitation put a hole in yo' ass
You know it's never my fault when I fuck up
I knock ya ass out, then wake you the fuck up
Brass knuckles and my knife, now tell me what's up
Would ya now

[Chorus]

[50 - over Chorus]
Son you know I don't like these sucka ass niggaz anyway
I'm tellin you these niggaz think you soft son
You see, you see what I'm tellin you
They think you sweet son
Fuck it, give me the strap son!

[50 Cent]
I made it to a half a mansion, I thought I made it
Hood bitches on a nigga yeah, all on a nigga yeah
The D's hit the door with the batter ram, rushin in
I'm standin by the toilet that's broke, tryin to flush the shit
Bizzy was my nigga, started fuckin with that cracker shit
Beat me out my money, nigga ran off with my Mac kid
Damn, I was down, he kicked me when I'm down
When I think about the shit it fucked my head up right now
You know the same niggaz that got me shot killed your brother
And you ain't never did shit about that muh'fucker
Them niggaz that's beefin wit'chu, I shot that park up
Now I'm thinkin 'bout the occasions my gun blazin
You got me feelin like a sucker B

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Son I don't give a fuck, son we can go back right now!
Niggaz gon' try to front on me and be right there?
Nah, nah, I'm puttin them niggaz on house arrest
I'ma go then I'ma go back, fuck that
I'ma stay on them niggaz 'til they can feel me breathin on 'em
You-you look at these fake ass niggaz
They think cause they say some fake shit in music
That the shit I be sayin ain't real
All you gotta do is ask niggaz, they'll tell you about me
They don't say 50 though, they say Boo-Boo
Uh-huh, find out, find out if I'll let it go
Man turn this shit off!

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Sprinkle a litle 2Pac on it
{2Pac: "It ain't easy bein me"}
I'm legendary, I'm necessary
They call me Ferrari, they call me 50
Call me Big Homie, hah

[50 Cent]
I got a bad bitch over the crib, I'm finna pop her off
Nigga call me in thirty, I'll beat and dropped her off
It's a quickie, the ass and the lips are super soft
And to top it off, she topped me off
Niggaz try to front on my swag, knock it off
Put the strap to the back of ya knot and knock it off
Homicide'll have to come through, block it off
That's what they do after that chopper get to choppin off
They say a nigga off, they think a nigga off
I'm on the runway, one way, takin off
I tell a chick, "Pay a pimp, bitch, break it off"
I smack a hoe, "That ain't shit, bitch, shake it off"

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Off and on; these niggaz be off and on
And it go {"on and on, on"}
And, it go {"on and on, on"}
Off and on; me? I'm never off, I'm on
And it go {"on and on, on"}
And, it go {"on and on, on"}
{2Pac: "It ain't easy bein me"}

[50 Cent]
Go 'head, ask about 50 Ferrari, I never take a loss
I'm a boss, tell niggaz to let it off, set it off
Diamond cloth, plush loft, niggaz floss at all costs
God damnit it all costs, get it now, half off
Diamond stud show-off, niggaz swag be so off
They stunt 'til I go off, the six hour blow-off
Hawaii mahi-mahi teriyaki, I'm so cocky
Who the fuck out here to stop me? Make a hater sit and watch me
And it seem like it is but it's not the same, man niggaz ain't got what I got my mayne
Got a flow so pure like brick cocaine, make a bitch wanna be my secret mayne
Freaky and you eat that thang, every now and then I beat that mayne
She tell a nigga not to say a thang, I can't keep a secret mayne

[Chorus]

{2Pac: "It ain't easy bein me"}

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Got the shotgun, got the handgun
Got the paper in my Nike box
Burn the haze up, better raise up
'Fore you get your punk ass shot

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
We hunt 'em down, and gun 'em down
Cut 'em down to the floor - nah nah nah
You fuck around, the tre-pound
That's six rounds for the raw - nah nah nah
We on the trip, fuck up a flip
Hundred grams of the raw - nah nah nah
We on the shit, we spit a clip
At your whip homeboy - nah nah nah

[50 Cent]
Yeah I run the town like a marathon, track star, trap star
Teflon shock plate, front and back, uhh
P-90 Ruger talk, 38-special flow
Hollow-tip, Prada shit, flyest nigga in New York
C-4 in the function, the bomb niggaz frontin
I got it like they want it so they hatin when I'm stuntin
I'm hot now, I'm bigger than the block now
Rolls drop top down, Lambo top down
Violate get shot down, I live by the codes you follow
I jux somethin nigga 'fore I beg or borrow
I come from the street where there's strong and there's weak
And when the strong hungry the weak's somethin to eat

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]
Yeah, this rap shit is fake if you really wanna ask me
I'm in the projects with a bitch like Cassie
Drop top Maybach, the roof all glassy
Level two vest on cause niggaz wanna blast me
I'm a menace to society, that's what the judge said
My kind of money leave the D.A. and the judge dead
Shorty turned 5 and he rep that 5
Shorty just turned 6 and he rep that 6
I got my crack and my fo'-fo' 'til fo' in the morning
Gas up the truck, fuck, global warming
My money be foreign, my cars be foreign
It's pedal to the medal in them Air Force Jordans

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]
Yeah, fo' bitches in the European whip +Set it Off+ like Cleo
Haitian bitches talkin Creole
Rappers feindin to ball, triple-header, Christmas day
Navy blue Phantom Ghost, box for the pistol play
Why Comrade Mary overdose on M.J.?
Why Big ain't have a bullet-proof truck like me?
Why the club shot up? What the fuck you expect?
They don't search niggaz buyin bottles at Juliet
Yeah I just left Southside, I'm Teterboro{?} Westside
Money team live the dream, haters tryin to strategize
We work hard, this ain't come easy
Bitch slob me in the coupe, yeah I cum easy

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah~! I am N.Y., no lie
Yeah~! I am N.Y., no lie

[50 Cent]
They say they do it like I do it with no mask on
Nigga get the fuck outta line you're gettin blast on
Jesus let the weak roam the Earth without a purpose
But I'll stomp your fuckin head 'til it's under the surface
Now I need you to get it through your bloodclat head
Before I put a bullet through your bloodclat dreads
These niggaz ain't made of the same shit I'm made of
I dump a clip for my man if he need a favor
I let a nigga slide, he came back and almost shot me
Then he was thinkin I was scared, naw nigga not me
They don't understand I was raised by the vultures
Killed laughin like hyenas in the crib full of roaches
Called grandmomma Mommy cause mommy already dead
And daddy been missin since I was a little kid
Now who dare goes there playin games with the orphan
They know my pedigree, test me, I'ma off 'em

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]
Stop the bloodclat cryin
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lyin
Don't cry, dry, your eye
Don't cry, dry, your eye

[50 Cent]
That first body drop, we just gettin started
Death come in threes; AR-15, M-16
Semi-automatic, murder machine
Wave that, blaze that, give a nigga wings
When that blade in your flesh it's an emergency
Your love leak, heart open, call the surgery
Feels like my last girlfriend, I lost her
On second thought I know just where I left her, the altar
See I have an advantage, I don't care about tomorrow
Find out that I ain't frontin when them casings start to fall
You know attempted murder was the case that they gave me
Nine bullet wounds now a nigga half crazy
What is that, a tear I see formin in your eye?
Why are you so frightened? We're all gonna die
You could say a prayer when I'm comin like the Reaper
Starin through that sight on the top of my heater
{*click-clack*} Now

[Chorus]

The murders have made it
impossible for them to dissolve the secret society
which leaves them only one course of action
To protect, defend, and expand
The bigger they get, the less vulnerable they become...
Be careful, they will do everything they can to manipulate you
Only if and when they can't, will they kill you

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
I'm insane, yeah, shit changed
I'm ahead of that BANG! BANG! Guerilla ryder gang!
Make it rain, trick, make it rain
I hold onto mind and buy more cocaine
I'm! Off the chain, nigga I ain't playin
I get in with the semi nigga stunt I make it rain
He rap, I rap but we ain't the same
He love her dame, I run a train
Canary yellow rocks in my rings
Everything private my hoes in my planes
Hurry now bartender more champagne 
I shine like chrome interiors on a Range
I stunt when I want I ain't never 'gon change
That gold lookin good in my Cartier frames
This what happen when the Bebe kids
Blow up I'm on out this bitch

Throwin cake on your wifey she lickin the icin
And a, it's not even my birthday

And plus yo' ass ain't 'posed to be here in the first place
Nowadays they holla Kidd let he hold sum'n

Ryder gang thang play the bitch then watch us ball

Tell the waitress bring the bottles with the top sparklin

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Sample from "Pee Wee Dance" by Joe Ski Luv)

[50 Cent]
Yeah
It is what it is son, niggaz can't stand it
It's my fifth lap, a nigga been 'round and 'round the planet
Shawty sayin "Welcome to Miami"
Her friends sayin "Welcome to Miami"
Jet skis, the yacht, parked in the back yard
Back to back Porsches, a nigga go that hard
I love money, nigga this drug money
Laundromat spin cycle, make it snow money
Beef nothin to a nigga, nigga I'm comfy
Throw a hundred racks on a bitch, I told ya she want me
If I want the hoe I get the hoe, fuck the hoe then forget the hoe
Let a hoe be a hoe, pay a pimp, pay the rent
I'm a fly nigga on or off, yeah I buy fly shit
Presidential Roley, nigga tell me, now can you buy that?
I'm the biggest nigga Southside seen since Fat Cat
I tell a nigga suck a dick quick cause I'm strapped jack

I make it double up, pure blocks of raw
I, I, I did it, I got to get more
I make it double up, baking soda galore
'Til we in Bentleys and mansions with marble on the floor
I make it double up
Ay bring me that Pyrex
Get the baking soda, the ice
I'ma show you how to do this shit
You think I don't know what I'm doin but I know what I'm doin

[Hayes]
We on the other side of the border chillin with drug lords
Tryin to put a order in during the drug wars
Jay said this what happen when you disrespect one of us
And cut a motherfucker head off right in front of us
That's when I said I'm goin back to Cali
My man said he goin back to Cali
I know some Mexicans in Arizona I'm cool with
I'd rather slang that than come and deal with this bullshit
... Cause I ain't gon' budge
Pay me or die G, dawg it ain't no love
Niggaz know who they owe, my number ain't change bitch
Front door service, put one in your brain quick
Could've put it right in your chest, close range shit
Watch you die slow, let you know who you playin with
Fuck all that swearin to God, promise and prayin shit
I ain't a big sob story fan, I'm sprayin shit
12-gauge, AR-15, AK'n shit
Passanger seats gon' get killed, I'm sayin this
Princi-pals, we don't draw the line at drug dealin
We crimi-nals goin all out
Before I say you played me I'll go in y'all house
And get killed there or blow your fuckin brains out
You gotta bring ya ass to get some
You gotta make cash to spend some
And I ain't a victim muh'fucker - Hayes

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Hey what's up man? It's the kid 50 Cent man

[Eminem]

Murder dem, murder dem
They violate I demonstrate, yeah I'll murder dem
Niggaz be frontin, word up, they stuntin 'til they hurt up
Their semi talk, I'll let it buck, I'll have these niggaz runnin hard
I'll pull a nigga's skirt up then have him kickin dirt up
I'll get a nigga, hit a nigga back up stupid hard
Silence, it's the return of the tyrant
See him through my third eye with both closed eyelids
Stand closer to the homie you wan' die with
Flames come up out the muzzle on the shit that I spit
Get murked! I'm talkin like the Feds ain't listenin
Nigga this a pool of piranhas you fishin in
I'll give it to a nigga if he want it
Better ask niggaz 'bout me, I'll be on it
I get the drop, blow at your knot, perfect plannin
Hit your back with somethin hot, out the cannon

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]
It's murder one (one)
It's premeditated - murder
Then it's another one (one)
Back to back put work in

[50 Cent]
You know I ain't got the strap on me
Bar holdin that for me
I'm fucked up, it really doesn't matter though
100 9-millimeter shells in the Calico
Wait, niggaz drop like dominoes
Run for your life puta, s??, v?monos
I was taught to treat my crew a long time ago
Grew up around cocaine, yeah, even my momma know
I cut a O in the fo' with seven at a time
Make 400 off that, you know a nigga grind
Like Cyndi Lauper bitch, +Time After Time+
A nigga shine, like a nickel-9
I been talkin to the man in the mirror
Niggaz so ass they be shakin like Shakira
It seems like my vision's gettin clearer
See me comin with the hammer out, death is gettin near ya
It's funny how niggaz never hear ya
'til ya run down on 'em; gun down on 'em

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, startin to feel like the old me!
Ha ha

[Intro: 50 Cent]

Hear my voice, you know it's 50

[2 Chainz]
Damn right I got it, damn right I got it

[Verse One: 2 Chainz]
I said lame niggaz be quiet, lame niggaz be quiet, lame niggaz be quiet
You in the presence of a real nigga
I said lame niggaz be quiet, lame niggaz be quiet, lame niggaz be quiet
You in the real nigga presence
I eat your girl up for breakfast, won't save you no extra
Say she fuckin with me cause a real nigga's her preference
Drink like I'm from Texas, and you know I stay flexin
And if you don't know I go by Tity 2 Necklace

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Nigga that's cocaine that I'm flippin (YEAH!)
Wood-Wood grain when I'm pimpin (GRRRR!!!!)
C-C-Codeine when I'm sippin bitch you fuckin right I be trippin (WOOOO!!!)

Count-Count my paper all of them stacks fuck-fuck some up then get it right back
NIG-NIGGA TRY ME!!!!!!

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I'ma start a riot, I'ma start a riot {*4X*}

[Verse Three: 2 Chainz]
Ain't stuntin these niggaz, ain't stuntin these bitches
Two cigarillos, look like extensions
Yeah I'm from the Southside, her mouth wide, my pack loud
My gat loud I back out, and click clack, pow pow
Court dates, skip trial, my rep is a reptile
An hour later, alligators, I stepped on the work like a stepchild
Pimps up, hoes down, make your girl pull her clothes down
Her hair down and I'm down, her phone off so don't dial

[Verse Four: 50 Cent]
That-That pyrex in my kitchen (Kitchen) Rich nigga still pitchin (Pitchin)
Them GD's and them Vice Lords love that gangsta shit that I be kickin (Kickin)
Who Blood now who Crippin?! (Crippin) Who pussy tell me who snitchin (Snitchin)
I got a firearm the fire on whoever done let that bitch in (Bitch in)
These-These niggas don't live by the codes, look how they done fucked up the game
Throw your sets up, if you don't give a fuck, It's 50 and 2 Chainz
Got the hood back poppin now thanks to this, I buy the whole bar nigga you can drank to this
Get the bottles poppin while the hoes watchin man damn I love this gangsta shit
Gang-Gangsta shit! 

[Chorus: 2 Chainz

[Outro: 50 Cent]
We 'gon get back to the real shit!

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Put on my O.J. gloves and watch me kill this shit
Beat the case then come home then go back from doin some different shit
I'm pullin off a O.J., a, a O.J.

[Kidd Kidd]
I'm smokin up my lungs, this liquor drownin my liver
I'm as usin these prescriptions, these pancakes now full of syrup
Mayweather all contenders, I eat each rappers for dinner
Put these rattin ass niggaz in the sewer, Master Splinter
Sound like my phone is bugged, give a nigga the jitters
But, I don't give a fuck, tell the pigs to kiss my shitter
Yeah I'm kind of thinner but Goddamn yo' jeans are slimmer
I don't want you 'round my children, you look like a sex offender
+Planet of the Apes+, I'm a G-Unit Gorilla
All these rappers claim they killers, probably sue you when you hit 'em
See, I'm not what you used to, I ain't Soo-Woo, I ain't Crip'in
I'm a Rida Gang nigga, we gon' get in where we fit in
Huh~!

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]
Put on my O.J. gloves then watch me kill this shit
Beat the case then come home then go back from doin some different shit
I'm pullin off a O.J., a, a O.J.
I'm pullin off a O.J., I'm killin these bitches!

[50 Cent]
Got a new bitch that's so bad, yeah she don't know what she doing
And her ass so round and fat, when she touch me I'm like BOING!
I want head and I want tails, so I don't wanna flip a coin
I don't kiss and I don't tell, so her close friend she can join
L called me from the pens, askin me how things are going
Said the money is still flowing, yeah the Rida Gang is still blowing
And my neck and my wrists and my ears and my fists got diamonds all over, shit glowing
And the Lambo ain't got no top; it ain't summer yet but it's hot
You gon' lose your speech when you hit the streets and you see the bitches I got
You better believe it's real, from the Philippines to Brazil
Lil' Mexican chica, I want you to meet her, people can give it to you pure
100% uncut; now nigga you know, what's up

[Chorus]

[Kidd Kidd]
Huh~! MJG, bitch I got them +8 Balls+
Four-door garage? Bitch I need eight cars!
They want me +Locked Up+, they singing like Akon
Her shot up, like I dove head on
Bitch my life right, and you niggaz dead wrong
I will take yo' head off so you can see me head on
I'm gettin my head blown, you know what her head on
She got my head gone, shit I'm 'bout to head home
Pimp zone, that's my destination
Still street, never handed in my resignation
Ding-Dong, I'm at your doorbell waitin
Who tryna get served? I'm 'bout to do some caterin
Huh~!

[Chorus]

[Intro: Robbie Nova]
Uh! Oh yeah! I just wanna! Still love you girl
And I'm not 'gon lie girl, I just wanna, I just wanna
Oh girl! 

[Chorus: Robbie Nova]
I could take you to dinner girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Go to the movie girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl
See I could take you shoppin girl but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Or I could feel you head up girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
Nigga really wanna get to know you girl, see many things I wanna show you girl
See anything I guess I owe you girl, Louboutin's, movin on
'Fore the sun comes up then the top comes down, find out what the white Rolls Royce about
Run the white Air's on extra clear, like James Brown a nigga do it like a +Sex Machine+
I got a hot, wheel, fetish, I pull up in some mean shit
Sex, drugs, rock and roll, Charlie Sheen bitch!
See me +Toot It And Boot It+ on my Obama shit
Money ain't no tellin how much I'm a get
I spit bars have the hood in a frenzy
Fuck around take a chain like Lindsay
Paparazzi takin pictures of my Fendi
Catch me in Prada, or maybe Asata
Just another beautiful day in .L.A.
And I'm a New Yorker professional shit talker HUH!!! 
I see niggas is stressin
And I'm straight so I'm guessin, I'm above the recession 

[Chorus: Robbie Nova]
I could take you to dinner girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Go to the movie girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl
See I could take you shoppin girl but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Or I could feel you head up girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
It takes just a little bit of my conversation when I talk
To make you clear fo' sho' that I'm that nigga in New York
Shorty now lay down, put your head back
I put your legs backstroke and move your bed back
When we get to them back shots, shorty throw it back
When you back it up, that mean, I like that
Let me guess I turn you on, I turn you on I bet
We just gettin started and everything soakin wet
This pussy good she ain't worried about the rent this month
This pussy must have went and bought this bitch that Benz out front
For me it's nothin I'm just fuckin for the fuck of it
But shorty actin like what we just did some other shit
It can't be, it could be ok maybe she's a good girl
Attracted to me and things from my world
Temptations are great
One ten is bracelets that worth eight carats are ten times eight

[Chorus: Robbie Nova]
I could take you to dinner girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Go to the movie girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl
See I could take you shoppin girl but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Or I could feel you head up girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Why should I waste my time lyin? The fuck would I be doin
Look let me tell you somethin right
If the bitch 'gon roll, or bitch 'gon get the joggin or walkin
Or however you know she wanna, you know exit
Bitch get! You know what I'm sayin and....
If a bitch came in, on BB's she 'gon leave on BB's I don't give a fuck
Get her that Chris Louboutins, Alexander McQueen, DaVinci
We could put you on all that fly shit, bitch the shit stayin in the closet
I'm a meet another bitch wear a size seven and a half
Fuck with me see if I'm bullshittin!

[Intro]
Yeah! You see a nigga soft, my first instinct is to lean on him
A weak nigga eatin in my hood niggas say put a beam on him
These niggas ain't supposed to be eatin yo, they sweet as Sweet'N Low
I'll have him like shit was all good just a week ago

[Verse One]
This is Fif niggas get you in the mood for love
I'm back to get you in the mood for the snub and gloves
Dope fiend, morphone, cocaine dilemma
Crack come to cook it up back boy I'm a chemist
Fuck pill poppin that strap I pop that
Watch the Henchmen trial see a rat, rat on a rat
He got a nice gimmick goin you been hot a few summers
But I got that kinda flow that could stop world hunger
SK I got nothin but energy
Call me 50 call me Ferrari the remedy
Hi again incase a hater don't remember me
I happen to be what these rap niggas they pretend to be
Hittin you won't be enough you gotta finish me
Or it's rueger time, the S-R nine
Frank missed ricochet and your ass go blind
Time's up your fucked, gotta learn to duck, what's up?!

[Chorus]
Don't make me! Don't make me! Don't make me!  
Seem so complicated
Don't make me! Don't make me! Don't make me!  
Show you what's up, don't make me fuck you up
    
[Verse Two]
Listen every bitch on the milk box ain't missin
I mean some of these hoes runnin 'round with pimpin
I'm writin reality it sounds harsh, Shyne tried to get at me he sounds washed
I ain't even fired back the shit's squashed
What kind of shit is that this only happens in rap
These niggas so fake it make my skin crawl
Hope I ain't the last real nigga up over the wall
Ice touchin the chain, waves spinnin, cream linen
Poses from the benjamins in 'em
Time forward, oh lord
If I ain't no better I think a nigga pushed raw
It feels like it's never gonna stop
A nigga so hot, i may spend forever on top
Forever ever, forever in a drop
Can't tell I got it on lock? BITCH!!!!!

[Chorus]
Don't make me! Don't make me! Don't make me!  
Seem so complicated
Don't make me! Don't make me! Don't make me!  
Show you what's up, don't make me fuck you up

[Verse 1]
I put the shit together, I tear the shit apart
Demolition the upper deck, I let you see the spark
Cut open your head, make your brain a landmark
Put what you're thinking on a curve, nigga, mock my word
Does the alley take it's turn be your loss
Double barrel rock's player has guitar off
You don't want it hard, nigga, I'll just go on you harder
Dog, you're stick, you're ripped, your hip stand decripped
You raise your leisure, pardon miss with the laser
You talk shit, I spit the razor
The master mind is a must, why you know how to touch it
I plug it, planned it and execute it, dammit

[Hook]
You're a killer, you damn nigga, you've been working all the time
You will shoot this night too with your maneuver, with the nine
I heard it all before, I'm straight coming at you, bro
This won't be a war, I get the gun, blow your face on the floor
I'll get you with the secret talk, nigga, all that makes you fall, nigga
Nigga I'll get the drop, yeah

Nigga, make one false move around me, I'll say fuck it, I'm riding
And they've no sense of try to dug me and motherfucker I'll found him

[Verse 2]
I still go to my 50's niggas everywhere I go I face
Catch me sleeping no days, you pussy niggas no way
To stop me you will need at least a mack boy
Shoot me with a 2-5 and I'll be like "what you do that for? "
The party poppin' ain't gonna cut it
But once you cross the line, you cross the line, nigga, so fuck it
I'm build for, try to do the shit I do get killed for
Lots of blood spilt for a thief I'm still known for
Niggas wanna bump with Ferrari, probably they ain't get the memo
I got cake to show weight
My gun and money make the nigga put a mask on
Shoot a head or break a leg, put a cast on

[Hook]

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
Try to remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Pocket full of green, green in the bong
That bitch with the bowlegged stance turnin me on
Two mill time these rainbows to be on
Niggas still want me dead like Osam
But they ain't 'gon make it they come at me wrong
Them niggas all workers who smack the shit out they bosses
Ferrari I'm stronger than five hundred horses
Money is power you niggas better wake up
My earrings blinkin that's old shit from Jacob
Add it up four plus four that's eight karats
You can't run and get your bid you ain't got it
Blackjack, we do that ten grand a hand
You could get shot fuckin with Floyd that's my man
Billionaire brotherhood we call this the money team
Pinky ring flawless my god I'm gorgeous

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, hoe, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, don't, ring the alarm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, nigga, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, this a al quaeda bomb

[Verse Two: Snoop Dogg]
I'm chillin like a villian while I'm dealin I am
Rulin while I'm coolin with the tool in my hand
Post up, coast up, this is my life bitch
Up close homey you get stuck with a knife bitch
Cuz burnt out, turnt out like a light switch
Got alot of hoes, but Charmaine that's my white bitch
The rest of my bitches nah they ain't gonna like this
But I don't give a fuck 'cause they all love this night stick
But I still remain calm, bang and drop bombs
Collar popped up, cool as The Fonze
Motherfucker! Have a seat and loosen up
Get a glass of some gin, now juice it up, deuces up
See it's a line there for a reason
And if you cross it, no more breathin, ya leavin
Believe it, we understand each other?
'Cause I would hate to have to put a slug in ya brotha, ya dig?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, hoe, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, don't, ring the alarm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, nigga, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, this a al quaeda bomb

[Verse Three: Precious Paris]
When Fif on that shit, that glock, cocks in your face
My twat, cocks in your face, you know you want taste
Alexander McQueen strapless with my back out
Six inch Davinci's a bitch fittin to act out
Niggas on my heels tryin to find out what that head like
I know what that bread like my bucky yard head like
Shine like I shine, night or daytime
My na, na na na na, make a nigga want buy everything I say buy
My na na na na, get wet I got that come back that crack
My assets, is my ass jack
Stunt I tell my niggas right, where your stash at
You fuckin with a Southside bitch, I go where the money go
I'm mad damn I put her on the stroll, get my money hoe
Catch me at Farrow Gahmer or Dolce & Gabbana
Or my Trigaliano I'm p squared up, what!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, hoe, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, don't, ring the alarm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, nigga, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, this a al quaeda bomb

[50 Cent]
I had 500 packs, 14 grams of powder
On the phone with my connect, this shit last about a hour
I need work, I repeat, I need work
My niggaz go berserk, when the drought come get murked
When no money comin in is when the guns come out
Why the D's wanna sit in front of my momma house
You know it's sorta like some shit you seen in a flick
Black .9 extended clip, as long as my dick
They say I'm grimy, yeah fuck it I'll line niggaz
I'll show 'em where your shit at before they take mine nigga (ha ha ha)
Don't take it personal, it's just how I grind nigga
Figure, this is a dog-eat-dog world, man
Ebony enemy, today I'm tryin to duck her
Got that Hoover, her head'll make you kill a motherfucker (don't stop girl)
I mean you gotta feel it man
She bob and weave, up and down, you be like "I could just kill a man"
I don't fuck with them niggaz from her projects
They on Section 8, but niggaz cars are straight
They ain't out in the daytime, them niggaz roaches
I don't stop down there if I ain't got the toaster
I'm in the 6-4-5 hard top, not the drop
Leanin, I see them niggaz schemin, dream on
Touch me, shit I wish a nigga would
I'm how my niggaz eat, I'll have 'em light up they whole hood

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
They said I fell off, my Benz was on the repo truck
Around the same time niggaz spots start gettin stuck
Shit, I said "I ain't know nuttin 'bout nuttin"
I'm on the low, niggaz really know me for stuntin
I pull through on low pros, wrapped around deep dishes
That crack money handsome, your bitch blowin me kisses
You need to check her if you think she could be the missus
Damn - I'm startin to think you can't trust nobody
I hold my own strap, they ain't got to hold that for me
I slide by my baby momma crib with the Mac on me
Man since her cousin in the car crash died
She said "Don't drink and drive," I say "Just drink, don't drive"
I had a morphine dream, I got heroin ambitions
That's big money cookin in that coffee pot in the kitchen
When I say I'm straight, I mean I'm straight
Once the razor hit the plate, I double up the cake, ayy

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
You's a purse snatchin ass nigga man
You's a PETTY nigga!
I could look at you I could TELL you's a petty nigga
You's a copy!
You's a itty-bitty nigga, I'm a big city nigga
New York City nigga, ha ha!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Nigga no wake, no pine box, no funeral, just nine shots
Take 'Pac five, plus BIG four, you got 50, I love war
Who waan box? with my ox, who waan dump? I waan dump
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
I think I got 'em, ten shots follow the trail of the blood drops
Fuck the police, better talk to Allah ack

Wake up I'm right there ya hell nound, hell yeah

Move the fuck out the way

Don't wanna play now
I'm on a roll
That's where I plan to stay
Look at the bed you made
And lay down

Nigga better watch what the fuck you say to me
Tricks are for kids don't play with me
You'll get smoked, I ain't for the bullshit
Got the chrome bulldog for that bullshit
Problem nigga, it's ok with me
The revolver always stay with me
You'll get smoked, I ain't for the bullshit
44 bulldog for that bullshit

Nigga that was my mama crack spot

Fuck a fist fight
Shit shift all of sudden, you can box my box cutter as I can see it cutting
Lord have mercy, jesus, lord have mercy
I bet this hurt you like it hurts me (it hurts)
Hot as hell when that gunpowder burning
What goes around don't come around
When I'm putting work in
Nigga swallow your pride and run
You stick around you're done

Body on the ground, it's OK with me

You'll get smoked, I ain't for the bullshit

I got a gun fetish, choppa in the trunk
I shoot a duck flying right out the sky with the punk
A nigga 8 out of 8 of moving targets

You think I'm joking I'm not
Find out when that Glock get to dumping
And your back get hot
I got a temper, you don't wanna test my patience
And end up doc's new patient
Stump your head on the pavement
You try come at me on some brave shit

Move the fuck out the way
This might get rain today
Don't wanna play now
I'm on a roll
That's where I plan to stay
Look at the bed you made

If we going out we going Dutch pay for your dinner bitch
Look bitch, this is my life I'm on some different shit
Every different day I wake up to play with a different bitch
Bitches love me, just like I love me
Fat bitch, skinny bitch, short bitch, tall bitch

In the strip club, let her lick your ass bitch
Get the cash bitch and then go back to your man bitch

Diamonds on my neck, diamonds, diamonds on my neck

They done made me mad, now I'm in my bag
And I'm back with the strap, catch a case, beat a case, rich nigga swag
Every step I take, every little itty-bitty move I make
Turn the big bags of birthday cake, I can't even fit this shit in my SAFE!
W-w-wait! Got more money, come and try not to hate
Why you think a nigga in and out of state? I'm a pro on the low when I operate

Stack on 'em, yeah rack after rack on 'em
Ghetto pharmacist man so I'm cuttin the smack for 'em

I hate when you niggaz do shit then make me ask why
If you the homie why you won't go and testify?
Why you wanna see a nigga get the chair and fry?
I'll grow old in the yard starin at the sky
Why you hurt your friends more than your enemies?
And why you don't sit and stroll through your memories?
Why is the question I ask
Shit was all good when you were splittin up stacks
That shit you told the people got 'em under an axe
Now why, would you wan' do some shit like THAT?
When that barrel on yo' forehead, don't ask why

I don't trick, e'ry now and then I toss her money
Fuck, nut, get up, that's abortion money
I'll kill if I have to, don't force me homie
I get that schoolyard duct tape extortion money
I hate when niggaz act like bitches cause it costs me money
What the fuck!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I'm in London blowin pounds, Japan blowin yen
It's the methodical diabolical nigga with a grin
My stash look like a rainbow, my money is gay
Nowadays I'm just happy things are goin my way
I'm straight, some say I got more than I need
Mucho dinero out in Mexico, they growin my weed
It's amazing, I made it here on my own
I got a frog, a dog with a solid gold bone
An accountant to count, the amount I spent
Wine cellar full of shit, we could all get bent
I got it made, I got Brinks truck money
Euros, grams{?}, you wan' borrow some from me?
My bank statements have you niggaz like "Damn!"
Bitch I got more +francs+ than a hot dog man
Get married, pay for one bitch, I'll buy her bar food
Kids don't try this shit at home, you can't do the shit I do
Whassup?

I put it down when I hit it, she'll be so happy she did it
I bet she'll never forget it, in bed I'm like a wizard
Sorta exquisite, she'll wanna visit over and over and over
Her body's a map, I'm the guide, I'm just here to show her
how I get to that G-spot, non-stop
Tick tock, time fly, hella fun, no lie
Oh I know I can give her what she need
Slow mo' or high speed, ecstacy true indeed

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[50 Cent]
You can hear us from the next room when we go at it
I started her addiction, she got a habit
She gotta have it, I'm always on my job
I work it nice and hard, I mean I work it how she want
She my homie lover friend, yeah she might just bring her other friend
Feel the rush, adrenaline'll make a nigga head spin
I say just keep it simple baby, we ain't got to complicate it
If you want it and I want it maybe we should have it maybe
We got one life to live, it's precious the time we share
Now call me when you're in need, baby girl I'll be there
Fo' sho' in me, you can confide
I'm a rider twenty-fo'/seven, ready to ride - yeah

[Chorus: Brevi] + (50)
You so sweet, come see me

You can be my bitch, you can be my bitch

[50 Cent]
My girl got a girlfriend, I call her her play thang
Why would I complain? She's everything to me mayne
We match together perfect, isn't this amazing?
... Isn't this amazing?
Back massage, menage, get turned on, I'm hard
Great sex, latex, I'm playin my part
Penitration, oral fixation, no camera tapin
We makin the headboard shakin until it's damn near breakin
Now I can tell you from the get-go, so you know how this shit go
This thing I got with my bitch is so ill I mean it's mental
I'm 'bout to break it down on all the freaky shit we into
If you're not into her you're into me and we'll still get you

[Brevi]
Right when we get to the crib (crib, crib)
Step right in (in, in)
Boy you know what this is (is, is)
You could be my bitch, bitch, bitch (hahaha, yeah, bitch)

[Chorus]

Bitch, I'm headin out of state
Got a jet waitin on the runway, baby

But when I get back you know just how it's goin down
We'll be back up in this bitch passin her around

[Brevi]
You don't want me to just play my role
You want me to come take controooool

[Intro: 50 Cent]
It's hot as a motherfucker out here
{"S-M-S, Audio"}

[50 Cent]
Summer heat hot, murder plots, niggaz gettin shot
Chrome rims for 6's, one wheel one Gixxer
Throw it up one hand, wave back at the bitches, I'm silent
Right before I snap, I'm violent
I call myself to tussle, I'm the boss and the muscle
Boy I'll feed yo' ass brass knuckles
A nigga come creepin through the fog, if you're scared get a dog
Get a male cause a bitch'll get you both in the morgue
Now peep the punchlines I'm punchin, these are knockout flows
I'm cyber-pimpin, I'm so new wave I got sci-fi hoes
This is next level mack shit, that's why my money stack quick
Twelve V's, V-12's, half of them triple black bitch
Lust, gluttony, greed, jealousy, envy me
Your pride's blurrin your vision, see I'm where I'm supposed to be
On top of the underground, still gritty, still run the city
Still Em, Dre and Fitty; fuck with me
I'm a usual suspect, when it's a hit
Turn up the volume, you hear my voice, yeah this the shit

[Chorus 2X: sample] {+ ad libs by 50 Cent and ScHoolboy Q*}
"Pardon me please, may I speak to you?"
"I feel this is something, I'm compelled to do"

[ScHoolboy Q]
Pistols and bad bitches, hustlers and bad business
Rappin was just a hobby, that hobby turned to a million
Had that oxy for sale, you can get it 50 a pill
You sniff it or let grill, wrap the foil, you know the drill
Uhh, money power and drugs my only reason to love
Never played cops and robbers, nigga we played Crips and Bloods
Like who the pimp said who the slugs, 2-11 on hookers' purses
Another double-up purchase, slingin 100 meters from churches
God won't forgive me but it still was worth it (ohh yeah)
Man I swear I needed some change, chains, golden rings and thangs
Niggaz watch videos and think them douche in rap's the hardest
But real loc's know that that type of shit make you a target
Either the pigs or I'ma get you while you playin boy
Hunt you like an animal, strapped with a beam that's Adderol
50 told me ambition wins when you're tellin ain't workin
I say I'd rather relapse than re-enact hurdles and put that work in
Yeah~!

[Chorus]

[ScHoolboy Q]
Floss if you want to, I'll send you home broke nigga
It ain't a secret I get money, you's a joke nigga
Make what you make in like two years less than a month nigga
Figg Side to Southside, but we up nigga
Uhh, yeah (gon' fuck around and make a trillion)

[50 Cent]
I woke up this morning, this is insane
Rich as a motherfucker and ain't much change
Open my eyes, no suprise, I'm with a different bitch
Different day, different ass, different tits
Strap under my pillow, I don't want legit
I'm not supposed to do this shit but I forget
The true principles of life are supply and demand
Guess if you never sold dope it's hard to understand
My man got knowledge of self, at my back God
Find out today's mathematics when that Mac go off
My temper volatile, grew up a violent child
Fuck a boy scout - I air yo' ass out
Nigga nice chain, dice game, try your luck
Shoot a couple head cracks, leave you while you up
I'm a fly nigga, my denim vintage
Gold medal 'round my neck like I won the Olympics

[Chorus]
We came from nothin, now they sayin we straight
Nigga hold up, hold on...
Hold on...
These niggaz they watchin every dime we make
Hold up, hold on...
Hold on...

[over Chorus]
You got that?
Let Yayo hold the strap son, it's cool
We got bail money, whatever
Y'all niggaz gotta chill
Just be cool about this shit, relax

[50 Cent]
We want that deluxe apartment in the sky with a clear view
Instead we get the D's in the rear view
We learn to play the game how it's supposed to be played
And so you know you violate you supposed to be sprayed
It's not a big deal to me, stay calm
I'll shoot the shit out a nigga then call the barrel Bonds
If I don't do this shit myself, bet I'll get it done
Shit on my nigga, you shit on me, we are one
Used to do graffiti, now look, we major
Don't make me write my name 'cross your face with a razor
Re-up, new joke, they said this sample the bomb
This shit can take a two then we cut the bitch with a one, uhh
Watch the fiends stand in line for the potency
No lactose involved, pure cocoa leaf
You can sniff that or cook that to my belief
That money comin in like we run the streets

[Chorus]

[over Chorus]
That's a bet
Find my form better
Nigga you got a gamblin problem
I'm winnin, you losin
YOU got the gamblin problem
Yeah... yeah
What's up? What we doin?

[50 Cent]
This shit go how I say it go when it's time to expand
So say it's over your dead body and that's the plan
You a gangster for real, you ready to ride
Nigga you gon' die a bad case of too-much-pride
Check my DNA, homie I'm a different kind
Hit the speed dial that quick, I'll get ya lined
Won't want your block, just cop the work from us
Them niggaz you call allies can't be trust
That Roley all gold, I got the Midas touch
Sometimes it's hard as hell not to touch stuff
On the phone I heard Yay' smacked the shit out a kid
Now Jimmy got life, go smack him again
When it's war, it will be war to the bitter end
If they ever say we lose, I start it again
That sneaky nigga sprayed that semi at yo' momma crib
With a silencer, we couldn't even hear the shit

[Chorus]

[over Chorus]
I don't fuck with them
Pssh, man, these niggaz is roaches man
Dirty ass niggaz
Boy you better be easy
I ain't playin wit'chu boy
Boy you must've bumped yo' motherfuckin head or somethin boy
I don't give a fuck about that old school shit
You talkin 'bout you got me fucked up nigga
Yeah...

[50 Cent]
Yeah (yeah)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Don't worry 'bout how I get my money, bitch just know I get my money
Don't worry 'bout how I spend my money, boy I got a lot
Don't worry 'bout that car I drive, don't worry 'bout that bike I ride
Don't worry 'bout them diamonds in that bezel on my watch
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
Don't worry 'bout a motherfuckin thang
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
We got a strap up in here if niggaz playin

[50 Cent]
When time pass and I'm not around, niggaz sayin I'm out of town
Probably movin them bricks around, they swear they know how I get down
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...
My closet full of that fly shit, black card when I buy shit
Sell the shit you get high with, these niggaz on my dick
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...
That's yo' bitch, I understand, I've seen it all on Instagram
I'm just, from the past, I done been all in that ass
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...

[Chorus]

[Yo Gotti]
Yeah! Nah
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it

Don't be worried 'bout my record deals cause I still got my plug
Don't be worried 'bout my bitch pimpin, she get money out that club (hah)
Don't be worried 'bout my partners and 'em, we get money, we eatin (I am)
You talk shit 'bout a real nigga, bitch you must be tweakin
Don't be worried 'bout my whereabouts, money all I care about
Keepin it real in my neighborhood, play with me and I'ma air it out
Why you worried 'bout my money nigga? Bitch you think I'm broke? (huh?)
The Feds worry 'bout what I'm doin, think I'm sellin dope
I may be and I may not - go to jail I may rot
I ain't never gon' snitch nigga - never been no bitch nigga
I got big guns, need a extra large, y'all niggaz got question marks
Talkin down on a real nigga, that's how you get a hater charged
Yeah

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Don't worry 'bout what they talkin 'bout, don't tell me what that bitch done said
I'm done with her, you can go with her, I'm leavin here with another bitch
Don't worry 'bout how they look at me, my diamonds on, damn look at me
These pussy niggaz be shook of me, wanna judge and throw the book at me
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it, had time to talk to my legal team
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it, ain't shit they could do to me
Still rockin, still rollin (rollin)
We holdin (holdin) bill foldin (foldin) you know it
When I start to ball out, money start to fall out
Throw it up, it fall out the sky~!
Baddest bitches go all out, whole bar get bought out
That's what I call my lifestyle~!

[Chorus]

I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition

While we were loving the fit
She just want some bread
I ain't talking to tits
And I just want some head
She from a Pirus sip
Where all them niggas wear red
I ain't flying no flags but I'm a gangster bitch
I say say no to drugs then I do that shit
Got a blue fleet of whips
I'm so hood nigga rich
You don't like the way I do it nigga eat your dick
I just call em when I want em don't need your bitch
See my blood on these diamonds everything proper
Your shit look grown and your shit look copper
It's turning homie that's why your turning on me
Admit it I made it, I can't be faded
I roll it up in public I'm a cancer man
Smoke it out in the open like I'm in Amsterdam
I do a hundred miles an hour switching lens in my lane
See my name around the globe niggas know who I am

[Chorus]
I got that animal (animal) ambition [x9]

You say you hustle like a hustle I be moving shit
Had a couch and a U-Haul filled up with bricks
Got them straps and long clips filled up with led
So when we count on the paper it better come back correct
We out in New Orleans baby niggas hungry for brick
I do that knife for stuntin get shot in the head
Every hood I go through they fuck with me you dig?
Got the eye of the tiger I'm on that animal shit
I got the heart of a lion and the looks of an elephant
Damn scared of rats, but I'm ready for anything
It's the unit my nigga, take a look at my face
See if you test me they'll arrest me I'll be catching a case
New York is a concrete jungle, where niggas got to get paid
Get in the way of that paper and niggas got to get sprayed
Look at me wrong and your dead
You should be very afraid
I don't know how to behave
I'm tamed fresh out the cage
Urrrrrrrrrrhhhh

[Chorus]

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Me, I'm like a pilot, G5 jet I'm fly as shit
You cannot deny it, oh no, no no no no
Bitches be on my dick, designer threads I'm fly as shit
You cannot deny it, oh no, no no no no
Better back up off me bitch, watch me ball (ball, ball)

E'ry day I get birthday cake, there's a hundred racks there in that safe
Hundred grams there on that plate, I ain't thinkin 'bout catchin no case
Nigga my safe house super safe, I zip Giuseppe's, I don't tie no lace
Tom Ford, Y-S-L, nigga run tell, I'm fly as hell
Big Bentley, Mulsanne, no LP, just two songs
A-side, B-side, Rider Gang, bitch that's right
From N.O. to N.Y., I got shooters bitch; don't act cute and shit
We was born broke, no silver spoon, my niggaz strapped, they super goons
These niggaz here kinda soft, we get the bread then fuck it off
Get mo' money then fuck it off, make yo' bitch wan' suck me off
We ain't had shit, we learned to ball, them ghetto bitches they love us all

[Chorus]

Yo' fuckin head, I'll crack that, you wan' test me? Don't test me
Look lover boy, what you trippin fo'? Niggaz don't even want yo' hoe
My nigga Ill fresh out the pen, you gon' make him go back again
Them bottles comin, we turnt up, them sparks burnin, now watch us shine
You do this shit once a year, we do this shit all the time
Now captain come and save her, get her from 'round this paper
She'll never be the same, I mean like e'rything will change
She cute, blow a lil' cheese on her, get her ass shots, throw D's on her
Them shoes more than you think though, my bitch look like my bank roll

Pink diamonds, pink sand, beaches Aruba
Blue sapphires on days when she feelin Hoover
She hood, and in the mood, when I'm in the mood
Erotic, so exotic, I'm psychotic about it
I don't want forever, I just wanna taste her love
Sample that product, I bet a nigga tongue go numb
She's a narcotic, that bomb shit burnin, we smokin
My old flame, my Mary Jane, we got a love thang
She ain't jealous, I keep Nina around
In the small of my back case some shit go down
Right under my Hermes, I'm hearin the word is, me
I'm a P-I-M-P
I let Trey hit some then Dre hit some
Then pass it to the homies 'til we all get done
Niggaz can't comprehend what this shit 'bout
Police comin {*puff*} put this shit out

[Chorus: Trey Songz] + (50 Cent)
You like smoke and you got me high (you know you make a nigga wan' put it down)

[50 Cent]
Shorty hot, she full blown, she hot now
100 degrees, that's with or without the top down
But when she get to workin her hips, you know the temperature rise
Oh Lord, soon as she see the dick in her thighs
She like the stones in my cross, she flawless
I'm thinkin damn, why would God give one woman all this?
You know I got the kind of conversation that make her feel like she need me
It's complicated, my occupation pimpin ain't easy
Facts, I stack racks on racks and racks
Back when I was pumpin crack, now my cards are black
Nigga get on my level, bark with the big dogs
If I want it I buy it, I don't care what the shit costs
Luther said it, a house is not a home without her
I had them panties on the Greyhound filled up with powder
But when she showed me what she'll do for me, has no limits
Her wantin is temporary cause fo' sho' she gon' get it
What's up?

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz] + (50 Cent)
Everybody showin the love, when she at the do'
Burn this bitch down, that's fire in the hole

Got me addicted, I'm trippin, where the stash at?

Lady, baby - just like smoke and got me high
So high; girl what the fuck you've done to me?
You got me feelin like you just rolled up for me
You're like smoke and you got me high (ring the alarm, it's on)

Hood nigga down there on Wall Street, my stock run across NASDAQ
Girl facin my time piece, ridin 'round with my grimies
These Brooklyn niggaz so grimy - I let 'em hold the steel, I tell 'em shoot to kill

[Chorus]

Kidd Kidd, uhh
All my niggaz crazy, stupid, cuckoo, got a loose screw

My bitch come from Honolulu with that dope all in her doo-doo
Put it on a train and choo-choo and the Feds don't have a +Blue's clue+
Slummin over, don't know voodoo but I sure know how to shoot-shoot
If I get caught I don't boo-hoo, I pick up the phone call Boo-Boo
He gon' bail me out in seconds, please don't let this rap shit fool you
I send shooters to your home, see I don't need no songs to move you
My gorillas goin ooh-ooh, all your family could lose you
Put you in a box like new shoes, you's a bitch, pull down your tutu
Any corner gettin money, all I know is we need buku
Speakin on me and my Rida Gang, know what we gon' do to you?
Huh~!

We ain't cut from the same cloth, we into different shit

Come out your mouth slick, I'll get you hit
My niggaz hungry, they hit a lick
Fuck who you're with, niggaz'll dump a clip
We by the school yard waitin for you to get your kid
I caught a A-1 felony on my last bid
Kept calm, made bond, I'm on that shit
You think my rap shit a gimmick
Hm-hm, I ain't seen parole in a minute
Truth be told, these niggaz is hoes
Once the shit set off, man anything goes
Through the windows of your soul, the eyes never lie
If you ain't scared to die nigga why would you cry?

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Mm, mm, mm
30-somethin and you ain't never open your mouth yet (uh-uh)
Social media is givin cowards an outlet (yep)
See 'em in person and say somethin, I doubt that (say somethin)
Rather get caught with it than get caught without that (yep)
Tryin to back-peddle and stumble on the curve (mm)
You starin at the ground (uh) you mumblin your words (yeah)
Literally I can see your heart pumpin through your shirt (haha)
You was pussy your whole life, you always been a bird (pussy)
Scared for so long it's all up in your nerves
Screw 9-1-1, probably call up the Reserves (mm)
And I'm killin you first, if we ever do a purge
And you know what it is kid whenever we emerge (you know)
Tragical (uh) dramatical (yep)
No match, incompatible, nigga, you vaginal
What~!

[Chorus]

[Kidd Kidd]
Money for bail, money to bail
Dead or in jail, Heaven or Hell
Fed's on my coattail, snitches given court tales
Kept fate when all hope fail
Niggaz rattin, all they missin is the tail
Like Mickey Mouse
Call me Mickey Mantle when I bat you in the mouth
I bring them hammers out, we ain't tryin to build a house
Niggaz on them songs rappin shit they ain't about
I'm from the N-O, we don't scrap, we bang it out
Bang! I'm the one that came in your house for the chickens
Left a nigga brains hangin out like we chillin
Stankin like chitlins, over my shillings
Hump your security, Rida Gang in the building
Huh~!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Don't make this complicated (don't make it!)
My old school candy painted (for real!)
I hustle hard
When I come through they're like "Oh my God!" (THAT NIGGA CLEAN!)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
From the beginning it was written I suppose
I break a whole into 36 O's - and move it
I'm a hustler baby (can you dig it?)
I'm a hustler baby
My mind on the money, I ain't trippin on the hoes
I blow a whole lot of paper on clothes - but dig it
I'm a hustler baby (can you dig it?)
I'm a hustler baby

[50 Cent]
Yeah~!
I come through, I have the hoes like "Ooh-wee"
Seats in the old school Louie
The shoes and the belt buckle Louie
We don't need more details now, do we?
Let 'em sag, my swag is True Religion
You gon' need Cartier frames to see my vision
It smells like Creed mixed with weed, this is classy and hood
Drama llama time nigga what's good?
Dominos muh'fucker, it's time to collect
Stack paper like I'm tryin to fix the national debt
I'm just doin what I wanna do, I trip through your set
This is 50 on that Muammar Gaddafi shit

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[50 Cent]
Get on my level bitch, I'm careful who I kick it with
We talk marketin, distribution and politics
Got a chip on my shoulder, chip off the ol' block
I sell a chip off a whole rock $10 a pop
I'm a magnet, a bitch can't help but watch me
Socks, drawers, undershirt, Versace Versace Versace
Designer threads, in every form of fashion
I express myself so the question I'm askin
Is this flip or the next flip, tailor fit the shit
We ain't promised tomorrow, a nigga gone and get the shit
That skull and bones, that Alexander McQueen thing
In case you ain't noticed, it's a Queens thing

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Outro: 50 Cent]
OHHH~! It's cold out here
It's my kind of weather, I'm cold-blooded
It's 50, when I come through you see me, in a Suburban
In this bullet-proof, bomb-proof, leather six whatever
When I go hard I go hard
When I don't want you to see me I switch it up
I'm in that black-on-black Porsche Panamera
In the back like, ooh-wee, we rollin
I hustle man, it's what I do man
What a nigga gon', what a nigga gon' try to tell me?
How to do this?

[Intro: Mr. Probz] + (50)
Here's a little info, you should know (it's 50)
You don't know what you're in for (c'mon, c'mon)
We get the

[Chorus: Mr. Probz] + (50)
Party rockin, bottle poppin
Tonight we gon' turn up 'til we, twisted
Yeahhhhhh (yeah yeah yeah, yeah)
System thumpin, the club is jumpin
Tonight we gon' turn up 'til we, twisted
Yeahhhhhh (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

[50 Cent]
Let's toast to success then take it a lil' higher
May tomorrow bring you everything your heart desires
Let your drivin ambition (uhh) offer you new visions (yeah)
May yo' gut instincts help you make good decisions (c'mon)
This is more than champagne, this is more than just a glass
This a symbol of accomplishment we rarely ever have (ha ha)
Let's enjoy tonight like tonight's our last
We can focus on the future and reflect on the past (woooo!)
We done came so far, I mean look where we are
If they don't call us by our name they call us entrepreneurs
From the block to the board room, the hood to the high life
Skyscraper paper baby, life in the limelight
Want the best of the best, the top of the top
I mean the baddest bitches, you know, the cream of the crop
We gotta hustle and have it, we better than average
More like the elite; my nigga we gotta eat, c'mon

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[50 Cent]
What was once a strike against us has become an advantage
Cause we grind when we at it like we stone-cold addicts
That mastermind, the mental is oh so essential (uhh)
Product of the environment (uhh) they ain't been where we been through (yeah)
I'm fond of the phrase "If there's a will there's a way"
Cause we come from the parts where only killers could play
Southside... it's alright
The ghetto's my Alma Mater, huh? It's alright (OOOH!)
We could keep the party jumpin like this all night
The bottles, just keep 'em comin baby, let's get right
"Let's Get It On"... play a lil' Marvin
It's gettin hot in here, homie this could be a problem
Keni Burke style, let's keep +Risin' to the Top+ (uh)
Let's do it, do it big, now let a fuckin hater watch
Oh yeah, this is perfect, this a moment to remember
As we proceed on our money-gettin agendas (hello~!)

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Chorus: Guordan Banks]
Are you ready to win?
Come join the winners circle
Put up your hands for me baby (put up your hands)
And do it like we're supposed to (do it like we're supposed to)
Oooh, cause we're gonna win

[50 Cent]
Yeah...
Fuck with the winners baby
Come put 'em up
Yeah, yeah, uhh

Consider this the theme song for victory
The shit you say to yourself when you make history
I'm tryin to make it feel like the first time
Like a junkie I'm sort of chasin my first high
I'm focused, I'm disciplined, I'm ready
Mentally on point, sharp as a machete
Hard work, I work hard, I get the job done
It's only one number 1, nigga I'm number 1
I'm confident, you can call it vain or conceited
Cars, clothes, I need it
Condos, condoms and bad bitches to be with, run with a winner baby
Be unconventional, freak me off with your friends maybe
You could be my, girl be my
... fair-weather friend
Or you could, be my, yeah, yeah be my
... friend to the end

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[50 Cent]
I got that disease ambition, success is the cure
They wanna win, I gotta win, I sell the shit pure
I got dopeboy bonds, Einstein brains
The heart of a nigga homicidal on a chain gang
I want yachts and drops, I got spots to watch
I wan' see what life is like from the mountain top
Who says sky's the limit? I'm +Limitless+, I just took the pill
Why you think a nigga slow flow's so ill?
Be careful, the shit I got's highly contagious
We hustle 'til it had us all locked up in cages
Time gon' fly when niggaz been biddin for ages
War stories and wounds, back and forth, niggaz been tradin
For the root of all evil, Lord said it's for Satan
We from the bottom, desperation cause moves that we makin
I guess it's all risk versus rewards
Y'all niggaz risk it all for the broads
What's up?

[Chorus] - 2X w/ ad libs

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Ohhhh, hey, ohhhh, hey
I'm still a rider, I'm still rollin
A nigga still holdin steel, that's how I'm on it
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You a sucker for love, nigga I'm money makin

[50 Cent]
I'm still a bona, I'm still ballin
It's five times I ain't pick up, your bitch still callin
I'm super ghetto, I'm still with the shit
Still pass the steel to my nigga, hit a lick~!
We still +Mobbin+, niggaz still starvin
We still deal after deal, shit is no problem
You still love her, she ain't shit
Get her a pair of Louboutins, she duck a dick
It's still real, niggaz +Still Will Kill+
Tote the steel, bitch don't squeal, get your cap peeled
The Mac filled, black talons, hollow tips, copper tops
Get ya ass popped, watch your body drop

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
I'm still a rider, I'm still rollin
A nigga still holdin steel, that's how I'm on it
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You a sucker for love, nigga I'm money makin

[Kidd Kidd]
Watch this cuz

I'm clean as a muh'fucker still gettin my hands dirty
Bitches they wanna fuck, grab a glass, you lookin thirsty
See I'm a gangsta, you soft {?} as singers
I'm at awards with the banger, in a club with the shanker
Mask all on rangers, scope on the K long ranger
Rather be alive and rich, than die and be famous
Live my life in the fast lane, not crash into anythang
I ain't here to entertain when I let them bullets sang
M-Zone, Rida Gang, slap the fuck out you nigga
Tryna pull out your pistol, when you know that you're lame
You chasin these bitches, instead of chasin yo' paper
Niggaz takin yo' bitches, while they takin yo' paper
I'm gone (Kidd Kidd)

[Chorus]

[Prodigy]
Aiyyo fuck that bitch dunn~!

She on my leg, like a lil' kid
She hump my leg, like a horny bitch
Pit bull in a skirt, yeah I'm a magnet
Nah I ain't runnin after no broad, she stuck on my dick
I'm a different breed, blame it on my genes
Money in my jeans, pocket turn her eyes green
She seein dollar signs, I'm seein reasons why
I never had to stress no pussy, I'm one of a kind
Pretty nigga, with a gorgeous gun
You die a beautiful death, pull a stunt
Look; there ain't a bitch more down than me
The thirst is real, she knockin over drinks to get next to me
While you

[Chorus]

[Styles P]
Tryin to get this money, you know?

Ghetto nigga still'll pick a penny up
You outside chasin them hoes throwin your Henny up
Lil' homie loadin the semi up
Catch 'em all after the club, tell 'em to ante up
Anyway, each and every day
I'm lookin for a better way, you owe me you better pay
Ghost let the Beretta spray
Hood one uncut dope, and some better yay
I ain't chasin pussy, never have
Hustle hard, take a break, run and get some head and ass
Still ridin, still rollin, still need a mask
Still poppin, still slingin, still need the cash

[Chorus]

[Intro: slowed down]
Boy you forgot my style

[50 Cent]
Flowers, funeral service, a kid's in the coffin
It sounds so familiar, don't it happen so often?
The shoot-out shit happens, the sister read the eulogy
Couldn't help but think, "Nigga better you than me"
Trey-eight ain't got no safety, that bullet got no name on it
But it's hard to miss when that thang got a beam on it
First shot pop off, e'rybody poppin
Shot the glass at the store front, we forgot God was watchin
Run run, hit the gate, D's yellin "Drop it"
Niggaz gettin jammed up; better that than a jammed-up
His momma said a few words to her, "He was innocent"
She might've heard he did some shit but never saw no benefits
So in her eyes, he's mommy's lil' baby
But he was outside, talkin to niggaz crazy
In a room full of people came to pay their respect
I just came to get a close look at a nigga to check
That nigga dead as a doorknob, stiff as a nail
And my man, tomorrow he gon' get out of jail
R.O.R., trust me nigga I know the law
Released on your Own Recognizance - that bullshit I'm on it
That's his first taste - I mean his first case
Got knocked with the strap - but not the one that clapped
This nigga here we still got that, yeah
The first law in my hood is show no fear
Him and love was closer than we thought, that nigga in here cryin
Oh shit, in the store he probably passed him the iron
These some grimy ass niggaz, full-breed vultures
Tryin to come up, still eatin around roaches
Cookie Crisp, Cap'n Crunch, breakfast of the champions
Lucky Charms, stay armed, and niggaz won't clap you then
We watch the side bitch talk like she his main bitch
His wifey just sat there, preachers wasn't sayin shit
Right jab, left hook, hand full of weave
This type shit a nigga got to see to believe
These bitches actin up in here, police they don't fuckin care
Homicide snoop around to them, we all with the shit
Cousin back from college sayin he gon' get who did this shit
He a ball player nigga, nigga better play ball
You play with the wrong niggaz we gon' get to lettin off
I done seen enough, feel like it's time for me to split
Hit the parkin lot and chill where the weed is lit
Twist the cap, pour out a little liquor
All the theatrics, you know, like that was my nigga
We all can't win, some of us gotta lose
Envision a lil' dog barkin at a pack of wolves
Cause that's what happened; yeah yeah, that's what happened
He just went on and on 'til niggaz started attackin
Actin like he was the only motherfucker packin

Fifty bars of pleasure, fifty bars of pain
When I'm dead and I'm gone niggaz will remember the name
It's 50... yeah, yeah
Fifty bars of pleasure, fifty bars of pain
When I'm dead and I'm gone niggaz will remember the name
It's 50... yeah, yeah, haha

See low we know
I'm sitting on leather I'm a winner
If I crap out the strap out
Cause I snap right back to the beginning nigga

[Chorus]
You know I will let it pop front if you want bitch I will make it hot
You (rrr) know you think you ill but you not
You will need a tombstone you will need a plot (yeah)

I peep what niggas hate through my peripherals
Boy if I leave this club back to the car I got some shit for you
Want party? We can paint the town red
Them bottles ain't shit to me a nigga got bread
I'm big money big business I love it
For the bad bitches with big asses and the budgets I'm the boss
Until you know shit is going how it got to go
I don't want talk tonight I might just buy the hoes
My pleasure principle spender's expense
First I'm happy then she happy then she can pay the rent
It's nothing to a nigga when he up
But when they down I bet you he won't give up at your bump
Flipping will catch your attitude 'like bitch what the fuck you want from a nigga huh?, you fucking up nigga huh?'
Look girl you know you sitting on a gold mine
Fuck with them other niggas think you so fine

[Chorus x2]

My flow hotter than the gun after that clip done
Don't care about the sit you claim mother fuck the finger bang
I hang around with hustlers and hoodlums that party get the popping
Then we beefing and we shooting
Let's party like it's 1999 flat top [?]
Swag going back in time
I got it locked they can't ignore it
My nigga know some bullshit I'm all for it
[?] Don seven sixty leaning
Chrome clean spend a nigga scheming trying to hit a lick
Them victim niggas thinking damn why me
I'm thinking why these niggas never try me
Maybe they feel the vibe they know a nigga lie
I let it off inside and outside
The club rocking it's on tonight
Them bottle's popping we getting right

[Chorus]

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Schoolboy Q]
Smiling...?
Nigga you gon' make me Flip On You!
You gon' make me flip this knife out do some shit to you!
Nigga you gon' make me Flip On You!
Nigga you gon' make me-you gon' make me Flip On You!
Nigga you gon' make me Flip On You!
You gon make me pull the strap out, do some shit to you!
Nigga you gon' make me Flip On You!
Nigga you ain't gon' be moving when this clip is through!

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
Nigga, I'm the one that bought all them bitches out
Got a G-A-T this MVP don't run his mouth, nigga
You gon' make me fill this clip for you
You gon' make me unload then reload 'em number 2
Nigga, I've been known to get them Oxys off
I believe in God, but cross my heart this knock go off
Nigga, I'm from the Mecca of the Groove
The Hoover Crip, I grew up on Figg I had to dodge them County Blues
Live my life behind the rules
Running from the cops, smash the rocks up under my shoes
Spit out the eighth that once, hid in my face
Bounce spring over the gate, didn't get caught
I guess my escape, nigga was fate
I love the block and all the dogs that kept me safe
Now it's, back to adding, points to the crime rate
Get slumped in your drive way
You gon' make me hurt your boy
You gon' make me put that work in boy
You gon' make me get to murkin' boy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Focus on money, I'm in and out ass fast
She loosen up against the wall like a NASCAR crash
Got a bunch of enemies, I count my friends on one hand
Ghetto philosophy, watch me, I got a hundred scams
Like we could make a few dollars, that there a hundred grams
I got a gift, I communicate with the afterlife
Apparently, your bitch ass ain't acting right
Niggas killed your man, you ain't gon' get him back?
What? You is tired out? Why you ain't get around to that?
[?] I travel, I have a destination
I'll be a street legend new version of Pappy Mason
My style? It'll never die, boy I'm a model
You shoot me down, I'll get back up and keep coming for you
Man on fire, hitman for hire
Them niggas got happy they thought I was gon' retire
Now they bitch giving me head, I'm the man, a man admires
What's up?

[Chorus]

"Rock Island Line"
Now this here's a story about the Rock Island Line
Well the Rock Island Line she runs down into New Orleans
There's a big tollgate down there and you know
If you got certain things on board when you go through the tollgate
Well you don't have to pay the man no toll
Well a train driver he pulled up to the tollgate
And a man hollered and asked him what all he had on board and said
I got livestock
I got livestock
I got cows
I got pigs
I got sheep
I got mules
I got all live stock
Well he said you're alright boy you don't have to pay no toll
You can just go right on through so he went on through the tollgate
And as he went through he started pickin' up a little bit of speed
Pickin' up a little bit of steam
He got on through he turned and looked back at the man he said
Well I fooled you
I fooled you
I got pigiron
I got pigiron
I got old pigiron
[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line
Looked cloudy in the west and it looked like rain
Round the curve came a passenger train
North bound train on a southbound track
He's alright a leavin' but he won't be back
[Chorus]
Oh I may be right and I may be wrong
But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Well the engineer said before he died
There were two more drinks that he'd like to try
The conductor said what could they be
A hot cup of coffee and a cold glass of tea
[Chorus]


"(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle"
He was riding Number 9
Heading south from Caroline
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow
Got in trouble, had to roam
Left his gal and left his home
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow
Just a kid, acting smart
He went and broke his darling's heart
I guess he was too young to know
They took him off the Georgia Main
Locked him to a ball and chain
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow
All alone he bears the shame
He's a number, not a name
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow
All he does is sit and cry
When the evening train goes by
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow
He'll be locked there in this cell
Til his body's just a shell
And his hair turns whiter than snow
He'll never see that gal he pines
He's in Georgia doing time
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow


"Country Boy"
Country boy, ain't got no shoes
Country boy, ain't got no blues
Well, you work all day
While you're wantin' to play
In the sun and the sand
With a face that's tan
At the end of the day
When your work is done
You ain't got nothin' but fun
Country boy, ain't got no ills
Country boy, don't owe no bills
Country boy, ain't got no ills
Country boy, don't owe no bills
You get a wiggly worm
And then you watch him squirm
While you put him on a hook
And you drop him in a brook
If everything's gonna turn out right
You're gonna fry fish tonight
Country boy, got a lot to lose
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes
[Instrumental break]
Country boy, you got a shaggy dog
Country boy, up a holler log
Well, he comes in a run
When you pick up your gun
And with a shell or two
And your dog and you
When you get your rabbit
You'll skin his hide
He's gonna be good fried
Country boy, you got a lot to lose
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes
[Instrumental break]
Country boy, you got work to do
Country boy, in the morning dew
You gotta plant the seed
You gotta cut the weeds
There's many a row
You know you gotta hoe
When it's quittin' time
And your work is through
There's a lot of life in you
Country boy, you lucky thing
Country boy, I wish I was you, and you were me
Unchained


"If The Good Lord's Willing"
If the good Lord's willing and the creek stays down
I'll be in your arms time the moon come around
For a taste of love that's shining in your eyes
If the rooster crows at the crackin' of the dawn
I'll be there just as sure as you're born
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
I'll comb my hair down brush my teeth
Shine up slick up dress up neat
Get everything looking just right
Cause I want to look pretty when I see you tonight
Just as sure as the rabbits are a jumping in the hollow
I'll be there you can bet your bottom dollar
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
If the good Lord's willing and the creek stays low
I'll be there a knockin' at your door
With a hug and a kiss for the one I idolize
I'll wear my suit, my Sunday best, I'll be there lookin' my best
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
I'll feed the mules and stop the hogs feed the cows and chop all the logs
Get all of my working done cause tonight we're gonna have lots of fun
Just as sure as there ever was a preacher man
I'll be there with a ring for your hand
If the good Lord's willing and the creek don't rise


"Cry, Cry, Cry"
Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down
I think you only live to see the lights uptown
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try
Cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry
Soon your sugar
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you
Bye, bye, bye
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own
You're gonna cry, cry, cry
I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry
When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me why, why, why
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been
You're gonna cry, cry, cry
Now Here's Johnny Cash


"Remember Me (I'm The One Who Loves You)"
When you're all alone and blue
No one to tell your troubles to
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
When this world turns you down
Not a true friend can be found
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
And through all kinds of weather
You'll find, I'll never change
Through the sunshine and the shadows
I'll always be the same
We're together right or wrong
Where you go I'll tag along
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
And through all kinds of weather
You'll find, I'll never change
Through the sunshine and the shadows
I'll always be the same
We're together right or wrong
Where you go I'll tag along
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you


"So Doggone Lonesome"
I do my best to hide this lowdown feelin'
I try to make believe there's nothin' wrong
But they're always askin' me about you darlin'
And it hurts me so to tell 'em that you're gone
If they ask me, I guess, I'd be denyin'
That I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it cryin'
Where's my darlin' when's she comin' home
I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
Well I make it pretty good until that moon comes shinin' through
And that I get so doggone lonesome
Time stands still when you're a waitin'
Sometimes I think my heart is stoppin' too
One lonely hour seems forever
Sixty minutes more to wait for you
But I guess I'll keep waitin' till you're with me
Cause I believe that lovin' you is right
But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow
If I can't have you with me tonight
Well I know, I'll keep on loving you 'cause true love can't be killed
I ought to get you off of my mind but I guess I never will
I could have a dozen others but I know, I'd love you still
Cause I get so doggone lonesome
Now Here's Johnny Cash


"I Was There When It Happened"
There are some people who say we cannot tell
Whether we are saved or whether all is well
They say we only can hope and trust that it is so
Well, I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know
Yes, I know when Jesus saved me, saved my soul
The very moment He forgave me, made me whole
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within, peace within
Satan can't make me doubt it, I won't doubt it
It's real and I'm gonna shout it, I'm gonna shout it
I was there when it happened
And so I guess I ought to know
I don't care who tells me salvation is not real
Though the world may argue, that we cannot feel
The heavy burden's lifted and the vile sins go
I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know
Yes, I know when Jesus saved me, saved my soul
The very moment He forgave me, made me whole
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within, peace within
Satan can't make me doubt it, I won't doubt it
It's real and I'm gonna shout it, I'm gonna shout it
I was there when it happened
And so I guess I ought to know

"I Walk The Line"
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
At San Quentin
I Walk The Line


"Wreck Of The Old '97"
They gave him his orders at Monroe Virginia
Sayin' Steve you're way behind time
This is not 38 this is old 97
Put her into Spencer on time
Well he turned around and said to his big greasy fireman
Hey shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Ol' Mountain
Watch ol' 97 roll
It's a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville
In a line on a three mile grade
It was on that grade that he lost his air brake
You see what a jump we made
He was goin' down the grade makin' 90 miles an hour
His whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam
Now all you ladies you better take a warnin'
From this time on and learn
Never speak harsh words to your true lover husband
He may leave you and never return


"Folsom Prison Blues"
I hear the train a comin'
It's rolling round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone
When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin'
And that's what tortures me
Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
At San Quentin


"Doin' My Time"
On this old rock pile with a ball and chain
They call me by a number, not a name Lord, Lord
Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
With an achin' heart and a worried mind
When that old judge looked down and smiled
Said I put you up that river for a while Lord, Lord
Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
With an achin' heart and a worried mind
You can hear my hammer, you can hear my saw
Gonna swing it like John Henry all day long Lord, Lord
Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
With an achin' heart and a worried mind
Well now it won't be long just a few more days
I'll settle down and quit my rowdy ways Lord, Lord
With that gal of mine, with that gal of mine
She's waited for me while I've done my time


"Run Softly, Blue River"
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)
Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep
Oh I thrill to her kisses and she thrills to mine
Run softly while she sleeps and dreams for a time
Cause she dreams of tomorrow when she'll be my wife
And I pray that as peaceful as you is our life
And if your murmuring soothes me till I'm sleeping too
Run softly Blue River we'll both dream with you
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)
Oh I thrill to her kisses
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)


"Frankie's Man Johnny"
Well now, Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
They were true as a blue, blue sky
He was a long
But he was her man nearly all of the time
Well, Johnny he packed up to leave her, but he promised he'd be back
He said he had a little pickin' to do a little farther down the track
He said
I'm your man, I wouldn't do you wrong
Well, Frankie curled up on the sofa, thinkin' about her man
Far away the couples were dancing to the music of his band
He was Frankie's man, he wadn't doin' her wrong
Then, in the front door walked a redhead, Johnny saw her right away
She came down by the bandstand to watch him while he played
He was Frankie's man, but she was far away
He sang every song to the redhead, she smiled back at him
Then he came and sat at her table where the lights were low and dim
What Frankie didn't know wouldn't hurt her none
Then the redhead jumped up and slapped him, she slapped him a time or two
She said
I'm Frankie's sister and I was checking up on you
If you're her man you better treat her right
Well, the moral of this story is be good but carry a stick
Sometimes it looks like a guitar picker just can't tell what to pick
He was Frankie's man and he still ain't done her wrong


"That's All Over"
Mhm mhm when you left I shed a million teardrops over you
But that's all over my crying days are through
When you left my heart was cold and every day was blue
But that's all over I've found somebody new
Someone that can make me happy make me wanna smile
Someone I'm gonna have around me for a long long while
Someday we may meet again but I won't fall for you
That's all over I've found somebody new mhm mhm
Someone that can make me happy
Yes that's all over I've found somebody new mhm mhm


"Troubadour"
(Troubadour troubadour troubadour)
The troubadour the troubadour sings from his heart
The song that's the hit of the show
Watch him sing and play the strings of his guitar alone in the bright spotlight's glow
The song was for someone he loved so true
Who loved him then left him for someone new
The troubaour the troubadour smile as he sings but his heart is breaking in two
They beg for more the troubadour sings once again
The song that's the hit of the show
Watch him sing and play the strings of his guitar alone in the bright spotlight's glow
There is a hush in the darkened hall a few hearts are heavy and teardrops fall
But in the crowd one head is bowed for the troubadour
And oh her heart aches most of all
Troubadour troubadour her heart aches most of all


"That's Enough"
Well now I heard that you been thinking bout me really I don't mind
I know you try to block my progress a lot of the time
Well the mean things you said don't make me feel bad
Cause I can't miss a friend that I never had
(I've got) I've got Jesus and that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
When I'm sick (he's there) and troubled (he's there)
When I call him he will answer my prayers (answer my prayers)
When I'm burdened (he's there) with a load (he's there)
That's when Jesus is a comforter (to my soul)
Well you may scorn me turn your back on me
God's got his arms wrapped all around me
(I've got) I've got Jesus and that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
You know there's been a lotta times that I didn't have a dime
And I didn't cry to nobody but my Lord
He heard my plea and came to see about me cause he's one thing I can afford
So if you push me down he'll pick me up
And he'll stick by me when the goin' gets tough
(I've got) I've got Jesus and that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
Well he's the great emancipator and my heart regulator (Jesus is) yes he is
He'll make my way brighter and my burdens lighter yes he will (Jesus will)
Well you may scorn me turn your back on me
God's got his arms wrapped all around me
And he fights down the devil till he makes him give up
And that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
When I'm sick (he's there)
A Believer Sings The Truth


"One More Ride"
I long for the trip don't need no grip I'm takin' one more ride
Way out there in the prairie air I guess it's in my hide
Oh the clickety clack of the railroad track is callin'
If a man could know where the Santa Fe goes when she gets under steam
And the big loud bell that bongs farewell to hear her whistle scream
She's bound to go where there ain't no snow a fallin'
One more ride
One more ride
I miss the gloom of the prairie moon that seemed to know my name
And the tumbleweed where the prairie don't feed I miss them just the same
They're all a part of a song of heart I'm sayin'
I recall the tune that I sang to the moon and it seemed to make it smile
And I rode away at the close of day and I stayed so long awhile
But I long to be where the memory is ringing
One more ride
One more ride
As the years go by I wonder why I longed to leave my home
And to hit the trail of the iron rail away out there alone
But my heart would sigh till I know that I am leavin'
If I don't come back on a oneway track way down from Mexico
You could find me there or any old where that a tumbleweed will grow
It's a goodbye now you'll never know how I'm grievin'
One more ride
One more ride


"I Still Miss Someone"
At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind has come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone
I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
because I still miss someone
Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
At San Quentin


"Don't Take Your Guns To Town"
A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out
[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town
He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away
[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town
He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again
[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town
He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words
[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town
Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered 'round
And wondered at his final words
[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town


"I'd Rather Die Young"
I'd rather die young than grow old without you
So don't ever leave me whatever you do
To see someone's picture where my picture hung
Believe me my darling I'd rather die young
I'd rather die young than grow old without you
So don't ever leave me whatever you do
Though others may tempt you and tell you they care
You'll find only sorrow in a secret affair
Don't leave me never leave me please don't leave me never leave me
I'd rather die young
I'd rather die young


"Pickin' Time"
I got cotton in the bottom land
It's up and growin' and I got a good stand
My good wife and them kids of mine
Gonna get new shoes, come Pickin' Time
Get new shoes come Pickin' Time
Ev'ry night when I go to bed
I thank the Lord that my kids are fed
They live on beans eight days and nine
But I get 'em fat come Pickin' Time
Get 'em fat come come Pickin' Time
The corn is yellow and the beans are high
The sun is hot in the summer sky
The work is hard til layin' by
Layin' by til Pickin' Time
Layin' by til Pickin' Time
It's hard to see by the coal
And I turn it off purty early at night
Cause a jug of coal
But I stay up late come Pickin' Time
Stay up late come Pickin' Time
My old wagon barely gets me to town
I patched the wheels and I watered 'em down
Keep her in shape so she'll be fine
To haul my cotton come Pickin' Time
Haul my cotton come Pickin' Time
Last Sunday mornin' when they passed the hat
It was still nearly empty back where I sat
But the preacher smiled and said that's fine
The Lord'll wait til Pickin' Time
The Lord'll wait til Pickin' Time


"Shepherd Of My Heart"
You're the shepherd of my heart so treat it tenderly
It's a heart that needs your everloving care
You're the shepherd of my heart until eternity lead it not into the valley of despair
While it's in your keeping guard it with your love
Shelter it from harm along life's way
You're the shepherd of my heart and darling honestly
It's a heart that will not ever go astray
You're the shepherd of my heart so surely you must know
You have but to speak and my heart will obey
It's at your command my dear because it loves you so
So my darling shepherd guide it where you may
If it be green pastures or a rocky road it will follow you and not ask why
You're the shepherd of my heart until the trumpet blows
And I go to meet the shepherd in the sky


"Suppertime"
Many years ago in days of childhood I used to play till evening shadows came
Then winding down an old familiar pathway I hear my mother call at setting sun
Come home come home it's suppertime the shadows lengthen fast
Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last
Through the distant clouds I see my mother
Her face is shining bright, with tender love
She's gone up in heaven, with her maker
And I can still hear her voice, from up above
(and she said)
Come home come home it's suppertime the shadows lengthen fast
Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last


"Oh, What A Dream"
I dreamed I walked in a field of flowers
Oh, what a dream
The houses all were silver towers
Oh, what a dream
Beside the road an angel sat
I said hello and tipped my hat
And stopped when I saw her smile
And set me down a while
I set me down a while
You dreamer you
I tried the angel for a kiss
Oh, what a dream
But she turned away and my lips missed
Oh, what a dream
She said
Sir, I'll have you know
I met you just a while ago
You're welcome for to sit
But calm yourself a bit, sir
Calm yourself a bit
You dreamer you
I fell in love like one, two, three
Oh, what a dream
I asked the angel to marry me
Oh, what a dream
She said
Sir, I can't marry you
But I'm a dream that can come true
There are dreams of much my worth
That live upon the earth, sir
Live upon the earth
You dreamer you
Then I awoke and found my love
Oh, what a dream
As heavenly as the one above
Oh, what a dream
We'll marry in a sea of flowers
Home will be a silver tower
There'll be heaven in my life
With an angel for a wife
With an angel for a wife
You dreamer you
You dreamer you


"Mama's Baby"
She said that she just couldn't leave her mother
I met a girl in our town I tour all my resistance down
I thought what a dream this gonna be
I live with her a month or two and like any boy in love will do
Ask her if she would marry me
But she was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
Though she love me like she never love the other
She was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother
Then I said well then probably the only thing that's left for me it's a going come back in a year
And so, the year past away, and then I try to win her hand again
She even pact her close, but wouldn't go
Cause she was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
Though she love me like she never love the other
She was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother
Well I hang around till finally I asked her to marry me
Her mother says that it would be alright
We bought ourselfs a little home
And I finally got her all alone but she stays with her mother every night
Cause she's a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
Though she love me like she never love the other
She was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother
Well she said that she just couldn't leave


"Fool's Hall Of Fame"
Well if I live to be a hundred, I won't forget the day
I broke the heart you gave me and let you walk away
That's when they hung my name in the fool's hall of fame
Ah baby since we've been apart, I can't console my heart
It cries and cries all night long
Can't I ever make you see this change you've made in me
Just give me a chance to tell you I was wrong
Yes they say that you'll forgive me and end this misery
You know I'll keep on a beggin till you come back to me
Don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame
Ah baby since we've been apart I can't console my heart
It cries and cries all night long
Baby can't you ever see the change you've made in me
Just give me a chance to tell you I was wrong
Yes they say that you'll forgive me and end this misery
You know I'll keep on beggin till you come back to me
Don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame
Don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame


"I'll Remember You"
I'll remember you
Long after this endless summer has gone
I'll be lonely oh so lonely
Living only to remember you
I'll remember too
Your voice as soft as the warm summer breeze
Your sweet laughter, mornings after
Ever after, I'll remember you
To your arms someday I'll return to stay
Till then I will remember too
Every bright start we made wishes upon
Love me always, promise always
Oooh, youll remember too
More Of Old Golden Throat


"Cold Shoulder"
There's a fire burning bright at our house tonight
Slow music playing and soft candlelight
On her lips I keep tasting the warm red wine
I'm there in her arms but it's all in my mind
The snow is piled high on the highway tonight
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover
I wish I could hold her instead of hugging this old cold shoulder
This old highway us like a woman
Sometimes she can be your best friend
But she's the real jealous kind
She's the lady that leads me to the life I dream of
She's the mistress that keeps me from the ones that I love
The snow is piled high on the highway tonight
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover
I wish I could hold her instead of hugging this old cold shoulder
God, I wish I could hold her instead of hugging this old cold shoulder


"Walking The Blues"
Old Apache squaw how many long lean years you saw
How many bitter winter nights shiverin' in a cold teepee shiverin' in a cold teepee
Old Apache squaw how many hungry kids you saw
How many bloody warriors runnin' to the sea fleein' to the sea
Well now they tell me that you saw Cochise when he made his last stand
He said the next white man that sees my face is gonna be a dead white man
Old Apache squaw how many broken hearts you saw
Have you had misty eyes for years could that mist be tears could that mist be tears
Well now they tell me
Old Apache squaw


"Goodbye Little Darlin' Goodbye"
Goodbye, little darlin', we're parting
Parting don't always mean goodbye
Although we had to part, you're always in my heart
Goodbye, little darlin', goodbye
Goodbye, little darlin', I'll miss you
Miss you like the stars would miss the sky
I hate to see you go, I'm gonna miss you so
Goodbye, little darlin', goodbye
Goodbye, little darlin', I love

"I Just Thought You'd Like To Know"
I just thought you'd like to know
Since you'd made your plans to go
It's gonna hurt me so to see you go
But I hope you find another love and he'll be good to you
But still and yet I can't forget the things we used to do
I just thought I tell you this
I love you since that first sweet kiss
It's gonna hurt to miss your tender kiss
But I hope you get to do the things you say you wanna do
But still and yet I can't forget the happiness we knew
I just thought you'd like to know how much you've hurt my pride
I just thought you'd like to know how much my heart has cried over you
But darling you could never see the misery you caused for me
So I will tell you so cause I just thought that you'd like to know


"You Tell Me"
Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried
Tell you why I stayed around tell me why she lied
I'll tell why my heart's broken tell me why she said goodbye
Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried
You tell me then I'll tell you
I'll tell you why I loved her tell me why she said goodbye
Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried
Tell me why I'm lonely I'll tell you why I'm alone
Tell you why I stayed around tell me why she's gone
I'll tell why my heart's broken tell me why she was untrue
Tell me why she left me and I'll tell you why I'm blue
You tell me then I'll tell you


"Just About Time"
(Just about time I'm feelin' blue tryin' to get over you)
Maybe it's just about time I told you I'm all through with you
But just about the time I start to tell you I start feeling blue
And just about then I lose my nerve and wait another day or two
Cause just about the time I think it's over I start missing you
(Hardest thing I'll ever do tryin' to get over you)
It's just about time I had my sayin' I told you a thing or two
It's just about time I paid you back you treat me like you do
But just about the time I get the nerve I can't seem to carry through
Cause just about then an mpty feelin' reminds me I miss you
(Like to find somebody new I could just get you)
(Just don't know what I go through tryin' to get over you)
It's just about time I let you know I've had my fill of you
But just about the time I think about goin' I start missin' you
I'd like to go find another love that'll never be untrue
But just about the time I think about leavin' I start missin' you
(Havin' a hard time feelin' blue tryin' to get over you)


"I Forgot To Remember To Forget"
I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
but I found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time
The day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
The day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
The Survivors


"Katy Too"
I'm not the going steady kind
I miss 'em all, all the time
I told Annie I'd be true
But I still think about Katy too
Katy too, Katy too
I still think about Katy too
If you should see miss Mary
Just tell her I'm her loving man
Give my love to Jane and Sue
But don't forget ol' Katy too
Katy too, Katy too
Don't forget ol' Katy too
I like Sadie's chicken stew
And Suzie's good at stitchin' wool
I like Mary's barbecue
But I still like ol' Katy too
Katy too, Katy too
I still like ol' Katy too
Now, girls I'm not the flirty kind
But I just can't make up my mind
I'd like to marry all of you
But I still miss ol' Katy too
Katy too, Katy too
I still miss ol' Katy too
To all the girls I make this toast
I love you eveyone the most
But don't ask me to say

Cupid you bet you been good to me

But if you give me all but two
Then let's squeeze in ol' Katy too
Katy too, Katy too
Let's squeeze in ol' Katy too


"Thanks A Lot"
You're tellin' everyone in town that I don't treat you right
You even say I stay away and don't come home at night
I'm losing you and you are all I've got thanks a lot thanks a lot
It seems you like to hurt me and you know I'm good to you
I'd give you anything I own do anything you want me to
Yeah now you really got me on the spot thanks a lot thanks a lot
Still I would forgive you if you'd let me I'd be glad if we could try again
But it seems that you're just out to get me
And it looks as if you're just about to win
No matter what you do I'll always do love you
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
And you're callin' me those things you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot
No matter what you do I always do love you
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
You say I'm happy but you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot thanks a lot


"Luther Played The Boogie"
We were just a plain ol' hillbilly band with a plain ol' country style
We never played the kind of songs that'd drive anybody wild
Played a railroad song with a stomping beat
We played a blues song, kinda slow and sweet
But the thing that knocked them off of their feet was, ooh
When Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie in the strangest kind of way
Play it strange
Well, we did our best to entertain everywhere we'd go
We'd nearly wear our fingers off to give the folks a show
Played jumping jive to make 'em get in the groove
We played sad songs, real slow and smooth
But the only thing that'd make 'em move was, ooh
When Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie
Now, did Luther play the boogie strange


"You Win Again"
The news is out all over town
That you've been seen out runnin' around
I know that I should leave, but then
I just can't go
You win again
This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trusting in you was my great sin
What can I do
You Win Again
Yes this heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trusting you was my great sin
What can I do
You Win Again


"Hey Good Lookin'"

"I Could Never Be Ashamed Of You"
Everybody says you let me down I should be ashamed to take you round
Makes no difference what you used to do darling I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way
In my heart I know that you'll come true darling I could never be ashamed of you
All the happiness I've ever known came the day you said you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe you've been cheated in the past and perhaps those memories will always last
Even though you prove to be untrue darling I could never be ashamed of you


"Get Rhythm"
Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock 'n' roll feelin' in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues
A Little shoeshine boy never gets low down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes
How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all the trouble from your worried mind
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on , get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock 'n' roll feelin' in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was gonna jump for joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a poppin' and he said again
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe
Does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm when you get the blues

"Rock And Roll Ruby"
Well I took my Ruby jukin'
On the out
She took her high heels off
And rolled her stockings down
She put a quarter in the jukebox
To get a little beat
Everybody started watchin'
All the rhythm in her feet
She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
When Ruby starts a
Boy it satisfies my soul
Now Ruby started rockin' 'bout one o'clock
And when she started rockin'
She just couldn't stop
She rocked on the tables
And rolled on the floor
And Everybody yelled
Ruby rock some more
She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
When Ruby starts a
Boy it satisfies my soul
It was 'round about four
I thought she would stop
She looked at me and then
She looked at the clock
She said
Wait a minute Daddy
Now don't get sour
All I want to do
Is rock a little bit more
She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
When Ruby starts a
Boy it satisfies my soul
One night my Ruby left me all alone
I tried to contact her on the telephone
I finally found her about twelve o'clock
She said
Leave me alone Daddy
cause your Ruby wants to rock
She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll
When Ruby starts a
Boy it satisfies my soul
Rock, rock, rock'n'roll

Rock, rock, rock'n'roll
When Ruby starts a
Boy it satisfies my soul


"It Was Jesus"
Well a man walked down by Galilee
So the holy book does say
And a great multitude was gathered there
Without a thing to eat for days
Up stepped a little boy with the basket
Please take this, Lord
he said
And with just a five loaves and two little fishes
Five thousand had fish and bread
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
It was Jesus Christ, our Lord
Now pay close attention little children
It's somebody you ought to know
It's all about a man that walked on earth
Nearly two thousand years ago
Well he healed the sick and afflicted
And he raised 'em from the dead
Then they nailed him on an old rugged cross
And put thorns on his head
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
It was Jesus Christ, our Lord
Well they took him down and they buried him
And after the third day
When they came to his tomb where they knew he was gone
Cause the stone was rolled away
He's not here for he is risen
The angel of the Lord then said
And when they saw him walking with these nail
They knew he came back from the dead
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
Who was it everybody
It was Jesus Christ, our Lord


"I Saw A Man"
Last night I dreamed an angel came
He took my hand, he called my name
He bid me look the other way
I saw a man, I heard him say
He said if I be lifted up
I'll draw all men to me
He turned and then I saw
the nail
that bled for me
I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there
My life my heart I gave
my soul was in his care
When I awoke my heart beat so and in the dark I saw a glow
This was no dream he turned my way
Again I heard my Saviour say
He said if I be lifted up
I'll draw all men to me
He turned and then I saw
the nail
that bled for me
I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there

"Are All The Children In"
When I'm alone I often think of an old house on the hill
Of a big yard hedged in roses where we ran and played at will
And when the night time brought us home hushing our merry din
Mother would look around and ask are all the children in
Well it's been many a year now and the old house on the hill
No longer has my mother's care and the yard is still so still
But if I listen I can hear it all no matter how long it's been
I seem to hear my mother ask are all the children in
And I wonder when the curtain falls on that last earthly day
When we say goodbye to all of this to our pain and work and play
When we step across the river where mother so long has been
Will we hear ask her a final time are all the children in (I come)


"The Old Account"
Well it was a time on earth when in the books of heaven
An old account was standing for sins yet unforgiven
My name was at the top and many things below
But I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees) long ago (I settled it all)
Yes the old account was settled long ago (hallelujah)
And the record's clear today cause he washed my sins away
And the old account was settled long ago
Well the old account was large and growin' every day
And I was always sinnin' and I never tried to pray
But when I looked ahead and saw such pain and woe
Well I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees)
Now sinner seek the Lord repent of all your sins
Cause this he has commanded if you would enter in
And then if you should live a hundred years below
Well you know you got it settled cause you settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees)


"Lead Me Gently Home"
Oh lead me gently home father
Lead me gently home
When life's toils are ended
And parting days have come
Sin no more will tempt me
There from thee I'll roam
If you'll only lead me father
Lead me gently home
Oh lead me gently home father
Lead me gently home father
If I fall upon the wayside
Lead me gently home
Lead me gently home father
Lead me gently home
In life's darkest hours father
When my troubles come
Keep my feet from wandering
There from thee I'll roam
Lest I fall upon the wayside
Lead me gently home
Oh lead me gently home father
Lead me gently home father
If I fall upon the wayside
Lead me gently home
Lead me gently home


"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"
I looked over Jordan and what did i see
Commin' for to carry me home
There was a band of angels, a
Commin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Commin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Commin' for to carry me home
I'm sometimes up, and i'm sometimes down
Comin' for to carry me home
But but i know my soul is heavenly bound
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
If you get there before I do
Comin' for to carry me home
Tell all my friends that I'm a
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Commin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Commin' for to carry me home
And now they're commin for to carry me home


"Snow In His Hair"
The years have been many, the years have been long
But at last I'm returning to daddy and home
He's looking my way though he hardly can see
God bless my old daddy he recognize me
There's snow in his hair and I helped to put it there
A halo of worry and care
As my daddy grows old he's more precious than gold
For I cherish the snow in his hair
His shoulders were bent with the weight of the years
I scarcely could hold back the flood tide of tears
He walked with a cane as he hurried along
Comin' to meet me to welcome me home
There's snow in his hair and I helped to put it there
A halo of worry and care
As my daddy grows old he's more precious than gold
For I cherish the snow in his hair


"Lead Me Father"
When my hands are tired and my step is slow
Walk beside me and give me the strength to go
Fill my face with Your courage, so defeat won't show
Pick me up when I stumble, so the world won't know
Lead me Father, with the staff of life
Give me the strength for a song
That the words I sing might more strength bring
To help some poor troubled, weary worker along
When my way is light but I still can see
With a strong hand, strike out the blindness in me
Show me work that I should carry on for Thee
Make my way straight and narrow like You wanted to be
Lead me Father, with the staff of life
Give me the strength for a song
That the words I sing might more strength bring
To help some poor troubled, weary worker along


"I Call Him"
Well, the blue's still in the water and the blue's still in the sky
And way beyond the blue there's someone watchin' from on high
My clothes may be ragged and my shoes may be worn
But I've been a wealthy boy since I've been born
Cause I call Him when I'm troubled and I call Him when I'm weak
And He always pulls me through my troubles some way and I believe
He'll be there
(He'll be there)
He'll be there
(He'll be there)
Like He always is to answer when I call Him
My mother used to tell me I should take it slow
The pace is not what matters, it's the direction that you go
Keep your feet upon the path and your eyes upon the goal
You'll have all the joy a heart could ever hold
And I call Him when I'm troubled and I call Him when I'm weak
And He always pulls me through my troubles some way and I believe
He'll be there
(He'll be there)
He'll be there
(He'll be there)
Like He always is to answer when I call Him
Like He always is to answer when I call Him


"These Things Shall Pass"
These things shall pass and some great morning
We'll look back and smile at heartaches we have known
So don't forget when shadows gather
The Lord our God is still the King upon His throne
A rose looks gray at midnight but the flame is just asleep
And steel is strong because it knew the hammer and white heat
These things shall pass and life be sweeter
When love and faith are strong they cannot long endure
These things shall pass so don't you worry
The darkest time is just one hour before dawn
So hold up high and face your troubles
And don't dispare if you must face them all alone
A rose looks gray at midnight but the flame is just asleep
And steel is strong because it knew the hammer and white heat
These things shall pass and life be sweeter
When love and faith are strong they cannot long endure
These things shall pass


"He'll Be A Friend"
Well, God told Noah to build an ark
He said it's gonna rain, gonna be dark
Call in the animals two by two
And don't let a sinful man go through
So the flood came just like He said
And every evil thing on earth was dead
But Noah's faith was like a rock
God laid his ark on a mountain top
He'll be a friend and guide you
He'll walk along with you
You'll feel it there inside you
He'll help you make it through
When things look dark Noah saw the light
Cause faith had told him right was might
If you need a friend He'll guide you
He'll be a friend to you
Well, you've heard of Samson, the strong man
The mightiest man in all the land
There was one purpose for his might
He had to deliver the Israelites
By the Philistines he was overcome
They tied him up to carry him home
But Samson prayed and his bounds were gone
He killed a thousand with an old jawbone
He'll be a friend and guide you
He'll walk along with you
You'll feel it there inside you
He'll help you make it through
God showed Samson what to do
And it's the same God that stands by you
If you need a friend He'll guide you
He'll be a friend to you


"God Will"
God will walk with me down the streets where no one else will walk
God will talk with me of things that no one else will talk
When no one else will walk and no one else will talk
When no one will, God will
God will share with me the little worries no one knows are there
God will care for me whenever there is no one else to care
When no one will be there and no one else will share
When no one will, God will
God will think of me when friends forget and fail to understand
God will strengthen me when I am weak and need a helping hand
When no one understands or lends a helping hand
When no one will, God will, when no one will, God will

Correct
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me
A rose, a carnation, the lily and an orchid make such a pretty bouquet
(Drink to me, drink to me)
But only the orchid was worthy of you, so I threw all the others away
(Drink to me, drink to me)
Then you took the orchid and you breathed on its petals
And after a day or two
The flower still blooms but the scent's not the orchids
It carries the savor of you
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me
So if you're gonna drink to me, drink with your eyes
And I'll never cry for wine
(Drink to me, drink to me)
Or leave a kiss in an empty coffee cup then pass it from your lips to mine
(Drink to me, drink to me)
Cause I've got a thirst burning way down in my soul
And honey from a sugar tree
Is not half as sweet as the air that you breathe
Honey come here and drink to me
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me


"Five Feet High And Rising"
My mama always taught me that good things come from adversity if we put our faith in the Lord
We couldn't see much good in the flood waters when they
were causing us to have to leave home
But when the water went down, we found that it had washed a load of rich black bottom dirt across our land. The following year we had the best cotton crop we'd ever had
I remember hearing
How high's the water, mama
Two feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa
Two feet high and risin'
We can make it to the road in a homemade boat
That's the only thing we got left that'll float
It's already over all the wheat and the oats
Two feet high and risin'
How high's the water, mama
Three feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa
Three feet high and risin'
Well, the hives are gone
I've lost my bees
The chickens are sleepin'
In the willow trees
Cow's in water up past her knees
Three feet high and risin'
How high's the water, mama
Four feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa
Four feet high and risin'
Hey, come look through the window pane
The bus is comin', gonna take us to the train
Looks like we'll be blessed with a little more rain
4 feet high and risin'
How high's the water, mama
Five feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa
Five feet high and risin'
Well, the rails are washed out north of town
We gotta head for higher ground
We can't come back till the water comes down
Five feet high and risin'
Well, it's five feet high and risin'


"The Man On The Hill"
Will we get cold and hungry
Will times be very bad
When we're needin' bread and meat
Where we gonna get it, Dad
We'll get it from the man
In the house on the hill
Yes we will from the man on the hill
Ploughin' time is over
Still the fields are bare
How we gonna make a livin'
With twenty acres to share
I'll beg for more land
From the man on the hill
Yes I will, I'll ask the man on the hill
I ain't got no Sunday shoes
That I can wear to town
Papa reckon the boss has got
A pair of hand
I'll go and ask the man
In the house on the hill
Yes I will, I'll ask the man on the hill
Maybe he will help us
Maybe we'll get by
But who's gonna pay the dyin' bills
If we all should die
We'll leave it to the man
In the sky when we die
Yes we'll leave it to the man in the sky


"Hank And Joe And Me"
In the desert where we searched for gold
The days're hot the nights're cold
Hank and Joe and me walked on
So bold and brave and free
For days and days we fought the heat
I got so thirsty and I got so weak
And when I fell 'cause I couldn't go
I heard Hank say to Joe
He's dyin'
(Dyin' dyin')
For water
Hear him cryin'
(Cryin' cryin')
For water
Well lay him down in the dust and sand he said
Joe you know he's a dyin' man
Leave him there and let him die
I can't stand to hear him cry for water
I don't remember how long I lay
But when I awoke it was the break of day
Buzzards circled miles ahead
I knew Hank and Joe were dead
My eyes were dimmed but I could see
A bed of gold nuggets under me
Now I know that it won't be long
Till they decorate my bones
Cause I'm dyin'
(Dyin' dyin')
For water
Can't help cryin'
(Cryin' cryin')
For water
Well they laid me down in the dust and sand he said
Joe you know he's a dyin' man
Leave him there and let him die
I can't stand to hear him cry for water
He couldn't stand to hear me cry for water


"Clementine"
(Oh my darlin' Clementine)
She knew that Cody was the man she wanted
But she had waited nearly all her life
Just one more trip to town to tell the boys goodbye
Then he'd be back to take her for his wife
(Don't you worry)
Clementine
Cody saddled up and left his darlin'
Then rode to town to celebrate his plan
He told 'em this would be his last carousing'
I'm gonna settle down boys if I can
(With my darlin')
Clementine
Someone said
It must have been past midnight
When Cody had to face a jealous man
Another story goes that no one really knows
But it seems there was a dance hall girl called Nan
(Don't you tell)
Clementine
We do know that the shot or two was heard from some back room
Then there was a silence in the place
Just one more trip to town but all his chips were down
They found Cody lyin' on his face
(Softly callin')
Clementine
So buddies, make a monument to lay down at his head
Sure you hate to leave your pal behind
Mother, help your daughter put her weddin' dress away
Cause Cody won't be ridin' back this time
(To his darlin')
Clementine


"Don't Step On Mother's Roses"
We all were called to come back
To the old home on the farm
Mother's passed away, what a mournful day
And as my daddy watched
His eyes were filled with pain and hurt
When someone stepped upon a rose
And crushed it in the dirt
Don't step on Mother's roses
Daddy cried
She planted them the day she was my bride
And every time I see a rose, I see her smilin' face
She made my darkest days look bright
Round the old home place
Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow
The way they did since many years ago
They'll bloom for me each year
And I'll have Mother near
Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow
Years have passed away
And how the old home place has changed
Daddy had to go, we all miss him so
Children pick the roses as they go along the way
But when their petals are abused, I hear my daddy say
Don't step on Mother's roses
Daddy cried
She planted them the day she was my bride
And every time I see a rose, I see her smilin' face
She made my darkest days look bright
Round the old home place
Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow
The way they did since many years ago
They'll bloom for me each year
And I'll have Mother near
Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow


"Great Speckled Bird"
What a beautiful thought I am thinking
Concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word
All the other birds are flocking 'round her
And she is despised by the squad
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great church of God
All the other churches are against her
They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name
Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake
She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky
In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is o'er
I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look
When He cometh descending from heaven
On the cloud that He writes in His Word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of that great speckled bird


"I Want To Go Home"
We sailed on the ship John B, my grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night, got into a fight
Well, I feel so homesick I wanna go home
So hoist up the John B sail, see how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home
Well, I feel so homesick I wanna go home
The first mate, he got drunk, broke up the people's trunk
Constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone, why don't you leave me alone
Well, I feel so homesick I wanna go home
Then the cook, he caught the fits, threw out all of my grits
Then he took and ate up all of my corn
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home
Well, this is the worst trip since I have been born
So hoist up the John B sail, see how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home
Well, I feel so homesick I wanna go home


"The Caretaker"
I live in the cemetery
Old Caretaker' they call me
In the wintertime I rake the leaves
And in the summer I cut the weeds
When a funeral comes
The people cry and pray
They bury their dead
Then they all go away
And here I work
And I somehow hide
From a world that rushes
By outside
But each night
When I rest my head
I'm contented
As the peaceful death
But who's gonna cry
When old John dies
Who's gonna cry
When old John dies
Once I was a young man
Dashing with the girls
Now no one wants an old man
When I lost my handsome curls
But I wanna say
When my time comes
Lay me facin'
The rising sun
Put me in a corner
Where I buried my pup
Tell the preacher to pray
Then cover me up
Don't lay flowers
Where my head should be
Maybe God would
Let some grow for me
And all the little children
That I love like my own
Will they be sorry
That Old John's gone
Who's gonna cry
When Old John dies
Who's gonna cry
When Old John dies


"Old Apache Squaw"
Old Apache Squaw, how many long lean years you saw
How many bitter winter nights shiverin' in a cold teepee
Shiverin' in a cold teepee
Old Apache Squaw, how many hungry kids you saw
How many bloody warriors runnin' to the sea, fleein' to the sea
Well, now they tell me that you saw Cochise
When he made his last stand
He said
The next white man that sees my face
Is gonna be a dead white man
Old Apache Squaw, how many broken hearts you saw
Have you had misty eyes for years
Could that mist be tears
Well, now they tell me that you saw Cochise
When he made his last stand
He said
The next white man that sees my face
Is gonna be a dead white man
Old Apache Squaw, how many broken hearts you saw
You've had misty eyes for years
Could that mist be tears
Old Apache Squaw


"My Grandfather's Clock"
My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died
Ninety years without slumbering
tik,tlk,tik,tok
His life seconds numbering
tik,tok,tik,tok
It stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died
My grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound
And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died
It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come
Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died
Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died


"It Could Be You (Instead Of Him)"
If you should meet some lonely soul
Who on this earth can't reach his gold
And he's travelin' down the road so dark and dim
Lend the hand, say a prayer
Give a smile that he might share
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him)
Befriend each stranger in the night
Help to make his burdens light
Lift up the fallin' ones and be a friend
(Be a friend)
Shed a tear, share a sight
Share his fears don't pass him by
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(It could be you instead of him)
Shed a tear, share a sigh
Share his fears don't pass him by
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(It could be you instead of him)

"You Dreamer You"
I dreamed I walked in a field of flowers
Oh, what a dream
The houses all were silver towers
Oh, what a dream
Beside the road an angel sat
I said hello and tipped my hat
And stopped when I saw her smile
And set me down a while
I set me down a while
You dreamer you
I tried the angel for a kiss
Oh, what a dream
But she turned away and my lips missed
Oh, what a dream
She said
Sir, I'll have you know
I met you just a while ago
You're welcome for to sit
But calm yourself a bit, sir
Calm yourself a bit
You dreamer you
I fell in love like one, two, three
Oh, what a dream
I asked the angel to marry me
Oh, what a dream
She said
Sir, I can't marry you
But I'm a dream that can come true
There are dreams of much my worth
That live upon the earth, sir
Live upon the earth
You dreamer you
Then I awoke and found my love
Oh, what a dream
As heavenly as the one above
Oh, what a dream
We'll marry in a sea of flowers
Home will be a silver tower
There'll be heaven in my life
With an angel for a wife
With an angel for a wife
You dreamer you
You dreamer you


"Loading Coal"
My pappy said when I was seventeen you're six feet tall and your face is clean
And it don't look right for a boy that old to not make a livin' loadin' coal
Loadin' coal loadin' coal I'm a double first cousin to a dad blamed mole
Never get rich for to save my soul and forty 'leven years a loadin' coal loadin' coal
Ain't never got acquainted with a dollar bill and I don't ever reckon that I ever will
A dollar ain't made for a fellar I'm told that scoops up a livin' loadin' coal
Loadin' coal loadin' coal
I cussed everything in the mining camp from a shovel and my pick to my carbide lamp
But I know mighty well till I grow old I'll still be a cussin' but loadin' coal
Loadin' coal loadin' coal
I know just as well as coal is black one of these days the mines were strike
And I'll sit around starvin' till I'm finally told
There's a nickel more a ton for loadin' coal
Loadin' coal loadin' coal


"Slow Rider"
I ride an old paint he's on the worry side
And I'm a saddle tramp about to cross the great divide
Where there's grass in the coolies and water in the drawl
And the forty pound saddle won't make us both raw
Slow rider, slow rider move on a little more
The sky boss is waitin' at the big ranch house door
I can't help but missin' the daughters that I had
One went to Denver the other went bad
My young wife died in a poolroom fight
But I try to keep singin' from morning till night
Slow rider, slow rider move on a little more
The sky boss is waitin' at the big ranch house door
Whenever I die take my saddle from the wall
Strap it on snuffy lead him out of the stall
Throw me on his back and turn him toward the west
He knows how to take me to the spot I love best
Slow rider, slow rider move on a little more
The sky boss is waitin' at the big ranch house door


"Lumberjack"
I lived on a farm out in Iowa
I pulled the corn and I worked in the hay
Got trapped by a girl but I wiggled free
Heard the Oregon timber callin' me
Will you tell me somethin', Mr lumberjack
Is it one for forward and three for back
Is it two for stop or four for go
Boy, ask a whistle punk I don't know
Well, I learned this fact from a logger named Ray
You don't cut timber on a windy day
Stay out of the woods when the moisture's low
Or you ain't gonna live to collect your dough
Will you tell me somethin', Mr lumberjack
Is it one for forward and three for back
Is it two for stop or four for go
Boy, ask a whistle punk I don't know
Well you work in the woods from morning to night
You laugh and sing and you cuss and fight
On Saturday night you go to Eugene
And on a Sunday morning your pockets are clean
Will you tell me somethin', Mr lumberjack
Is it one for forward and three for back
Is it two for stop or four for go
Boy, ask a whistle punk I don't know


"Dorraine Of Ponchartrain"
As I walked by the lake one day by chance my Dorraine passed my way
Then she and I walked hand in hand on the banks of Ponchartrain
I pinned a flower on her heart, I swore we'd never be apart
She vowed her love forever and as I kissed her did the same
Dorraine, my Dorraine, my dark haired little angel
My belle of Ponchartrain
We sat down on the dock and with our hearts and fingers locked
We laughed and talked and joked about when our names are the same
And joking I said honey are you marrying me for money
And it took just one quick look to tell it hurt my dear Dorraine
She jumped and stood above me and she cried why you don't love me
I'm rowing home across the lake you won't see me again
I called and called some more but she rowed fast from the shore
And the clouds brought by a wind began to rain on Ponchartrain
Dorraine, I called Dorraine
Come back my little angel my belle of Ponchartrain
The storm should make her learn that she should make a swift return
But as the rain fell harder I lost sight of my Dorraine
As panic gripped my heart I drew the oars and made my start
To look for her on raging waters and the rain on Ponchartrain
At darkness I still called but no one heard my cries at all
And when the daybreak came then others helped me look for my Dorraine
But there was not a thing afloat except the oars from her rowboat
For all was lost upon the choppy waves and rain on Ponchartrain
Now I come day after day to where my sweetheart rowed away
And I gaze across the water of the rainy Ponchartrain
Just one thing and nothing more ever floated back to shore
Was this flower I hold it is the one I pinned on my Dorraine
Dorraine, my Dorraine, my dark haired little angel
My belle of Ponchartrain


"Going To Memphis"
Bring a drink of water Leroy
Bring a drink of water, no
If I could get to the mercy man
He'd give me some I know
I got a gal in Vicksburg
Bertha is her name
Wish I's tied to Bertha
Instead of this ball and chain
I'm goin' to Memphis, that's right Lord, yeah
A dude took all my money
Wouldn't let me see the cards
I owe the boss about a hundred years
For sleepin' in his backyard
I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah Memphis
Yeah I'm goin' to Memphis
Like a bitter weed, I'm a bad seed
But when that levee's through and I am too
Let the honky tonk roll on
Come mornin' I'll be gone
I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah Memphis
I never been to Chicago
But it must be a mighty fine place, that's right
I couldn't get past Tennessee
With Mississippi all over my face
I'm goin' to Memphis, that's right Lord, Memphis
Well, the freezin' ground at night
Is my own foldin' bed
Pork salad is my bread and meat
And it will be till I'm dead
Well, I brought me a little water
In a Mr. Prince Albert can
But the boss man caught me drinkin' it
And I believe, he broke my hand
They all call me crazy for sassin' Mr. Scott
My brother was killed for a deed I did
But I dis remember what, yeah
Well another boy is down
The shovel burned him out
Let me stand on his body
To see what the shoutin's about
I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah I'm goin' to Memphis
Like a bitter weed, I'm a bad seed
But when that levee's through and I am too
Let the honky tonk roll on
Come mornin' I'll be gone
I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah Memphis


"When Papa Played The Dobro"
My papa was a hobo when they delivered me
We didn't have a doctor cause he couldn't pay the fee
But when the goin' got too bad to ease his misery
Papa played the dobro this a way and he'd go
When company would come around he kept the dobro hid
He knew he couldn't play the way the other players did
Why the guitar's resonator was a gallon bucket lid
But papa played the dobro this a way and he'd go
Well now that papa's gone away it's hanging by the flue
The top of it's rusted and the strings're rusty too
It won't ever sound the way that it did when it was new
When papa played the dobro this a way and he'd go


"Boss Jack"
Pick a lot o'cotton, drag a long sack
Comin' across the field, well, I see Boss Jack
He's a ridin' straddle of a single foot roan
When you know that horse, you'll leave him alone
The ole roan's got green in his eyes
Mean as the devil and twice as wise
A fire in his nose and a bow in his back
Can't nobody ride him but Boss Jack
Come on children, bend your back
Work a little faster, fill your sack
Then you hitch up the wagon, take it to the gin
Finish pickin' before the winter sets in
Now here while back, when the crop was laid by
Remember who took us on a big fish fry
Caught a heap of catfish, goggle eye and carp
Dashed and sang to the guitar and the harp
Well, someday old Boss Jack is gonna set us all free
Gabriel gonna blow for you and me
Angels gonna bring that chariot from above floppin'
Their wings like a turtle dove, come on children


"Old Doc Brown"
He was just an old country doctor in a little country town
Fame and fortune had passed him by though we never saw him frown
As day by day in his kindly way he'd serve us one and all
Many a patient forgot to pay although Doc's fees were small
Though he needed his dimes and there were times that he'd receive a fee
He'd pass it onto some poor soul that needed it worse than he
He had to sell his furniture couldn't pay his office rent
So to a dusty room over a livery stable Doc Brown and his satchel went
And on the hitchin' post at the kerb below to advertise his wares
He nailed a little sign that read Doc Brown has moved upstairs
There he kept on helping folks get well,for his heart was jus'pure gold
But anyone with eyes could see that Doc was gettin' old
Then one day he didn't answer when they knocked upon his door
Old Doc Brown was layin' down but his soul was no more
They found him there in that old black suit on his face was a smile of content
But all the money they could find on him was a quarter and a copper cent
So they opened up his ledger and what they saw gave their hearts a pull
Beside each debtor's name old Doc had write these words Paid In Full
Old Doc should had a funeral fine enough for a king
It's a ghastly joke our town was broke and no one could give a thing
Cept Jones an undertaker he did mighty well
Donatin' an old iron casket he had never been able to sell
And the funeral procession it wasn't much for grace and pomp and the style
But those wagon loads of mourners they stretched out for more than a mile
We wanted to give him a monument we kinda figured we owed him one
Cause he made our town a better place for all the good he'd done
We pulled up that old hitchin' post where Doc had nailed a sign
We'd painted it white and to all of us it certainly did look fine
Now the rains and the snows have washed away our white trimmin's of paint
There ain't nothin' left but Doc's own sign and that's gettin' pretty faint
But you can still see that old hitchin' post as if in answer to our prayers
Mutely tellin' the whole wide world Doc Brown has moved upstairs


"The Fable Of Willie Brown"
Well I knew a boy named Willie Brown
He was A lover of our town
Wherever he went the girls fell down
And cryed for Willie Brown
Crazy about Willie Brown
Tall and dark and lean and long
Big as a bull and twice as strong
He loved the girls and turned them down
A sheek was Willie Brown
Dang sheek Willie Brown
Well a new girl moved in on our street
We knew that she and Will would meet
But when we inquired around she had not met Willie Brown
She said who's Willie Brown
The prettiest girl you ever saw head to
Toe without A flaw
When we met one night in town she fell for
Willie Brown, In love with Willie Brown
But the trouble was that
We all knew Willie Brown was falling too
Then He announced
When June comes around
She'll marry Willie Brown
She's in love
With Willie Brown
But then the girl denied it all,she said
Its true that I did fall but he took my love for granted now
To heck with Willie Brown, conceided Willie Brown
Willie Brown was shocked to learn that his love had at last been spearned
So on a Hill ouside of town we buried Willie Brown, we buried Willie Brown


"Second Honeymoon"
I walked up to the desk and asked the man about a room
I asked about the bridal suite, I told him I'm the groom
Then I took the elevator to the floor I was assigned
I fumbled with the key the way I did that other time
Inside I thought of all the things that started in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon
I hear the happy people laughing in the street below
But the loneliness I feel tonight I hope you never know
The life that was a happy song has ended much too soon
And I'm alone on our second honeymoon
I look around the room and see you standing everywhere
The fragrance of your bridal flowers seems to fill the air
The blushing bride that gave me such a free and eager kiss
Two loving arms around me as you offered wedded bliss
We'd said that we'd return to live it over in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon
More Of Old Golden Throat


"Ballad Of The Harp Weaver"
Son said my mother when I was knee high
You need of clothes to cover you and not a rag have I
There's nothing in the house to make a boy's britches
Nor shears to cut a cloth with nor thread to take stitches
There's nothing in the house but a leaf end of rye
And the harp with a with the woman's head nobody will by and she began to cry
That was in the early fall and when came the late fall
Son she said the sight of you makes your mother's blood crawl
Little skinny shoulder blades stickin' through your clothes
And where you get a jacket from God above knows
It's lucky for me lad your daddy's in the ground
And can't see the way I let his son go around and she made a queer sound
That was in the late fall when the winter came
I'd not a pair of bridges nor a shirt to my name
I couldn't go to school or out of doors to play
And all the other little boys passed our way
Son said my mother come climb into my lap
And I'll chave your little knees while you take a nap
And oh but we were silly for half an hour or more
Me with my long legs draggin' on the floor
I rocked rocked rocked to a mother goose rhyme
Oh but we were happy for half an hour's time
But there was I a great boy and what would folks say
To hear my mother singin' me to sleep all day in such a daft way
Men say the winter was bad that year fuel was scarce and food was dear
A wind with a wolf's head howled about our door
And we burned up the chairs and sat upon the floor
All that was left us was a chair we couldn't break
And the harp with the woman's head nobody would take for song or pity sake
The night before Christmas I cried with the cold
I cried myself to sleep like a two year old
And in the deep night I felt my mother rise
And stare down upon me with love in her eyes
I saw my mother sitting on the one good chair
A light falling on her face from I couldn't tell where
Looking nineteen and not a day older
And the harp with the woman's head leaned against her shoulder
Her thin fingers moving in the thin tall strings
Were weave weave weaving wonderful things
Many bright threads from where I couldn't see
Were running through the harp strings rapidly
And gold threads whistlin' through my mother's hands
I saw the web grow and the pattern expand
She wove a child's jacket and when it was done
She laid it on the floor and wove another one
She wove a red cloak so regal to see
She's made it for a king's son I said and not for me but I knew it was for me
She wove a pair of bridges and quicker than that
She wove a pair of boots a little cocked hat
She wove a pair of mittens she wove a little blouse
She wove all night in the still cold house
She sang as she worked and the harp strings spoke
But her voice never faltered and the thread never broke
But when I awoke there sat my mother
With the harp against her shoulder lookin' nineteen and not a day older
A smile about her lips and a light about her head
And her hands in the harp strings frozen dead
And piled up beside her toppling to the skies
Were the clothes of a king's son just my size
The Christmas Spirit


"Smiling Bill Mccall"
Well, the whole town listened to the radio
For the Smiling Bill McCall Show
Everyone in Nashville
Was listenin' to Bill
I don't want to be layin' in bed
When they pronounce me dead
He'd stand and breathe in the microphone
With his guitar hangin' to his knee bone
All the girls just sat and dreamed
When Bill began his sing
I don't want my hat to be hung
When my last song is sung
But he never let fame go to his head
This is Smiling Bill McCall
he said
Gonna pick and sing a song or two
You all listen till I'm through
And if you're at the house or in your car
Tune in this time tomorrow
To all the boys he was a big hero
They'd glue their ears to the radio
Then talkin' a most unusual drawl
Imitatin' Bill McCall
Daddy, can I get me a guitar
Cause I want to be a star
The girls would say of Bill McCall
Why I bet he's over six feet tall
Handsomest man in Nashville
They said of Smiling Bill
He won't be plantin' potato slips
When he cashes in his chips
Then one day Bill didn't make the show
Didn't even show up for a week or so
The station's boss said to city hall
Find Smiling Bill McCall
It won't be hard to track him down
He's got the biggest feet in town
Well, there's a creek that runs through Nashville
And on the bank they found Smiling Bill
He's committin' suicide
But they grabbed him before he tried
Turn me loose, I want to jump
he screamed
Cause I can't stand that theme
Let this be my final breath
Cause I'm scared to half to death
The big brave Smiling Bill McCall
Is only four feet tall
I'd rather be in the river dead
Than to hear 'em laughin' at my bald head


"Seasons Of My Heart"
The seasons come the seasons go
We get a little sunshine, rain and snow
Just the way that it was planned to be
But there's no seasons in my heart
While you play the leading part
Cause the flowers will bloom eternally
Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow
And my tears like withered leaves will fall
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow
And, darling, we could be happy after all
As it is in nature's plan
No season get the upper hand
How I try to keep this fact in mind
The trees are bare the cold wind blows
And by experience we should know
Winter comes but the spring is close behind
Your leaving will bring


"I Feel Better All Over"
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere else baby
When I'm out with you
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere else
When you kiss me like you do
Well, I am as wild as a buck everytime you cause me up
You sure makes me feel like a wheel
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere else
That's exactly how I feel
Oh, I feel better all over more than anywhere else
When you whisper sweet nothings in my ear
Oh, I feel better all over more than anywhere else, honey
Anytime that you're near
Well, my heart beats double time when you hold your hand in mine
You sure is a wonderful deal
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere else
That's exactly how I feel
Oh, that's exactly how I feel


"I Couldn't Keep From Crying"
I saw you walking by his side
Heard you whisper all those lies and I
Couldn't keep from crying
You sang him love songs tenderly
Just the way you sang to me me and I
Couldn't keep from crying
I saw you capture all his charms
While he held you in his arms
With his pretty words and ways
In your heart, he took my place
I stood and watched him steal a kiss
From two lips, I know I'll miss and I
Couldn't keep from crying
I saw you capture all his charms
While he held you in his arms
With his pretty words and ways
In your heart, he took my place
I stood and watched him steal a kiss
From two lips, I know I'll miss and I
Couldn't keep from crying


"Time Changes Everything"
Time has passed I've forgotten mother nature does wonderful things
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything
You can change the name of an old song rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything
Goodbye goodluck may God bless you Idon't say I won't love again
I guess that it's true for me and for you that time changes everything


"My Shoes Keep Walking Back To You"
I may say that I don't care, hold my up head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through my heartaches start anew
And that's when I miss you most of all
And my arms keep reaching for you
My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you
No matter how much I pretend I wish I had you back again
Cause nothing else means half as much as you
My world just seemed to die the day you left my side
And I can't forget no matter what I do
And my arms keep reaching for you
My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you


"I'd Just Be Fool Enough (To Fall)"
Oh please don't be so careless with your glances
Don't look at me that way and breathe a sigh
Please don't get too close and let me love you
Cause I just might be fool enough to try
It's not that I don't think I'm worthy of you
But memories from the past I still recall
Please don't get too close and let me love you
Cause I just might be fool enough to fall
It's not that I don't think I'm worthy of you
But memories from the past I still recall
Oh, please don't get too close and let me love you
Cause I just might be fool enough to fall


"Transfusion Blues"
Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds
Took a transfusion and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' 44 beneath my head
Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a transfusion and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico
Late in the hot joints takin' the pills
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said
Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down
Said
Yes, oh yes my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant just a read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
Put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that country jail
Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commenced to look about
In about five minutes in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
Verdict read in the first degree
I hollered
Lowdy, Lowdy have a mercy on me
The judge he smiled as he picked up his been
Ninety
Ninety
I can't forget the day I shot my woman down
Come on you guys and listen unto me
Lay off that liquor and let that transfusion be


"Why Do You Punish Me (For Loving You)"
Why do you punish me for loving you
You're counting my mistakes, how about yours
Why do you sentence me, too nice of tears
Convicting all these dreams, I've dreamed for all these years
My heart cries out behind these prison bars
It pleads to you for your true love to set it free
Why do you punish me is love a crime
If so I'll spend the lifetime, loving, serving time
My heart cries out behind these prison bars
It pleads to you for your true love to set it free
Why do you punish me is love a crime
If so I'll spend the lifetime, loving, serving time


"I Will Miss You When You Go"
I will miss you when you go much more than you'll ever know
But I'll have a memory to keep you near
In my heart you will remain but it just won't be the same
I will miss a million things that make you dear
Your lovely ways make you so sweet I prayed the angels fair will keep
You're happiness so you'll be blessed just as you deserve to be
I wonder why there are so few lovely people like you
My but I will surely miss you when you go
Your lovely ways make you


"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide its face and cry
Did you ever see a Robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That means he's lost his will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry
[Instrumental break]
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I'm so lonesome I could cry
American IV: The Man Comes Around


"Just One More"
Put the bottle on the table
Let it stay there till I'm not able
To see your face in every place that I go
I've been sitting here so long
Just remembering that you are gone
One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
One drink just one more and then another
I'll keep drinking it won't matter
I'll just remember that I once had her
I don't know why, I sat and cry every day
I've been trying to forget
But I haven't stopped as yet
One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
One drink just one more and then another
Put the bottle on the table
Let it stay there till I'm not able
To see your face in every place that I go
I've been sitting here so long
Just remembering that you are gone
One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
One drink just one more and then another


"Honky Tonk Girl"
Don't be fool by big blue eyes by a smile or a golden curl
Cause she'll love you now and then break every vow
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl
Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one
She knows all the arts of love she'll give your heart a twirl
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl
She can never change your ways though you'll give her all the world
She's had more than one or two and each day there's someone new
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl
Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one
She knows all the arts of love she'll give your heart a twirl
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl


"Sugartime"
Well now sugar in the morning sugar in the evening sugar at suppertime
Be my little sugar and love me all the time
Honey in the morning honey in the evening honey at suppertime
Be my little honey and love me all the time
Put your arms around me swear by stars above
You'll be mine forever in the heaven of love
Sugar in the morning sugar in the evening sugar at suppertime
Be my little sugar and love me all the time
Now sugar time is anytime that you're near oh you're so dear
Now don't you roam just be my honeycomb and live in a heaven of love
Well sugar in the morning


"Down The Street To 301"
There's a boy across the street lately he's looked very neat
Seems he's always on the run down the street to 301
(Seems he's always on the run down the street to 301)
Saturday he mows the lawn it's about a crack of dawn
Nine o'clock the work's all done down the street to 301
(Nine o'clock the work's all done down the street to 301)
When it's back to school this fall winter's chill may end it all
But for now there's lots of fun with the girl at 301
(But for now there's lots of fun with the girl at 301)
Maybe they will never wed sure they may break up instead
But for now she is the one the girl who lives at 301
(But for now she is the one the girl who lives at 301)
The boy who lives across the street has a reason to be neat
He's in love and on the run with the girl at 301
(He's in love and on the run with the girl at 301)
Don't you tell 'em to beware of a summer love affair
You know she is only one the girl that live at 301
(You know she is only one the girl that live at 301)


"Life Goes On"
My baby left me just the other day
I guess the things will never be the same
But I must forget that she is gone
Cause time goes by and life goes on
Making plans, shaking hands
Try to prove that I'm a man
It's hard to do but I must try
Cause life goes on and so will I
It's been kinda tough these last few days
Trying to act normal and be gay
It's not easy to be all alone
But time goes by and life goes on
If I see her anywhere
I hope she thinks that I don't care
For after night there comes the dawn
Yes time goes by and life goes on


"Port Of Lonely Hearts"
A ship came in, but it was empty
And then it sailed back out to sea again
Now there's the sail on the horizon
And now I wait until your ship comes in
And I'll be waiting in the port of lonely hearts
Watchin' for your topsail on the sea
Prayin' that my ship of love will come
To the port of lonely hearts where I will be
I'll brave the storm until you're with me
Cause wind and rain can't change a love that's true
I'll be alone until you anchor and then
I'll leave this lonely port with you
Till then I'm waiting in the port of lonely hearts
Watchin' for your topsail on the sea
Prayin' that my ship of love will come
To the port of lonely hearts where I will be


"Cry, Cry, Cry"
Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down
I think you only live to see the lights uptown
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try
Cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry
Soon your sugar
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you
Bye, bye, bye
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own
You're gonna cry, cry, cry
I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry
When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me why, why, why
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been
You're gonna cry, cry, cry
Now Here's Johnny Cash


"My Treasure"
I saved a lot of money my fortune was untold
And like a fool I idealized my silver and my gold
My earthly treasure's mounted but when I counted through
I realized the treasure I had overlooked was you
My treasure unmeasured but forsaken of the treasures that come from above
My treasure unmeasured but it don't hold a heart of the one that I love
If I had my life before me if I could see it all
I'd stake my claim on things that are secured against downfall
I'd work for earthly treasures like any man would do
But I set my sights much higher and I'd be sure that I had you
My treasure unmeasured unmeasured


"Oh Lonesome Me"
Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set set me free oh lonesome me
A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
I thought of everything from A to Z oh lonesome me
I'll bet she's not like me she's out and fancy free
Flirtin' with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms
Well there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I thought of everything from A to Z oh lonesome me oh lonesome me
Well I'll bet she's not like me
Oh lonesome me


"Home Of The Blues"
Just around the corner there's heartache
Down the street that losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops
You'll find me at the Home of the Blues
I walk and cry while my heartbeat
Keeps time with the drag of my shoes
The sun never shines through this window of mine
It's dark at the Home of the Blues
Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest mem'ries
Mem'ries so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad
I just want to give up and lay down and die
So if you've just lost your sweetheart
And it seems there's no good way to choose
Come along with me, misery loves company
You're welcome at the Home of the Blues
Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest mem'ries
Mem'ries so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad
I just want to give up and lay down and die
So if you've just lost your sweetheart
And it seems there's no good way to choose
Come along with me, misery loves company
You're welcome at the Home of the Blues
You'll find me at the Home of the Blues
Yeah, you're gonna find me at the Home of the Blues


"So Doggone Lonesome"
I do my best to hide this lowdown feelin'
I try to make believe there's nothin' wrong
But they're always askin' me about you darlin'
And it hurts me so to tell 'em that you're gone
If they ask me, I guess, I'd be denyin'
That I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it cryin'
Where's my darlin' when's she comin' home
I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
Well I make it pretty good until that moon comes shinin' through
And that I get so doggone lonesome
Time stands still when you're a waitin'
Sometimes I think my heart is stoppin' too
One lonely hour seems forever
Sixty minutes more to wait for you
But I guess I'll keep waitin' till you're with me
Cause I believe that lovin' you is right
But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow
If I can't have you with me tonight
Well I know, I'll keep on loving you 'cause true love can't be killed
I ought to get you off of my mind but I guess I never will
I could have a dozen others but I know, I'd love you still
Cause I get so doggone lonesome
Now Here's Johnny Cash


"You're The Nearest Thing To Heaven"
I have sailed the peaceful waters of the ocean deep and blue
I held my breath and watched the western sunsets golden hue
I've flown above the mountain peaks and valleys wide and green
But you're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
You're the nearest thing to heaven yes you are
I have searched for happiness so long and far
But my search for love was through the day that I found you
Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven yes you are
I confess that I've been tempted by a luring magic charms
When the smile was flashed my way and stood before two open arms
But I turned and walked away because I love you like I do
You're the nearest thing to heaven darlin' you
You're the nearest thing to heaven
I have watched the silver raindrops fall to earth to cool the day
Watched the rainbow at twilight when the clouds had blown away
I love the pretty flowers but they cannot buy the worth
Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven on this earth
You're the nearest thing to heaven


"The Story Of A Broken Heart"
Hmm the story of a broken heart
Well the sprinftime is coming and the honeybees are humming
And I just saw a robin flying by
While your wedding bells are ringing my poor heart is singing
The story of a broken heart hmm the story of a broken heart
When the trees start to blooding the mem'ries start to flooding
And my heart takes a trip to yesterday
When we walked neath the moon an our love was in bloom
Now we're two lovers drifted apart hmm the story of a broken heart
Now the wedding invitation forced out to your relation
But you ask me to give the pride away
Although I can't show it I think that you'll know it
A story that's told from my heart hmm the story of a broken heart


"Hey Porter"
Hey porter
Would you tell me the time
How much longer will it be till we cross
that Mason Dixon Line
At daylight would ya tell that engineer
to slow it down
Or better still, just stop the train
Cause I wanna look around
Hey porter
What time did ya say
How much longer will it be till I can
see the light of day
When we hit Dixie will you tell that engineer
to ring his bell
And ask everybody that ain't asleep
to stand right up and yell
Hey porter
It's getting light outside
This old train is puffin' smoke
and I have to strain my eyes
But ask that engineer if he will
blow his whistle please
Cause I smell frost on cotton leaves
and I feel that Southern breeze
Hey porter
Please get my bags for me
I need nobody to tell me now
that we're in Tennessee
Go tell that engineer to make that
lonesome whistle scream
We're not so far from home
so take it easy on the steam
Hey porter
Please open up the door
When they stop the train I'm gonna get off first
Cause I can't wait no more
Tell that engineer I said thanks alot
and I didn't mind the fare
I'm gonna set my feet on Southern soil
and breathe that Southern air


"He'll Understand And Say Well Done"
Give, when you give Him the best of your service
Tellin' the world that the savior has come
Be not dismayed if man don't believe you
He'll understand and say
Well done
Oh, when I come to the end of my journey
Weary of life and the battle is won
Bearing the staff and the cross of redemption
He'll understand and say
Well done
He'll understand and say
Well done
Misunderstood the savior of sinners
Died on the cross, He was God's only Son
But He knew well that his Father in Heaven
Would understand and say
Well done
Oh, when I come to the end of my journey
Weary of life and the battle is won
Bearing the staff and the cross of redemption
He'll understand and say
Well done


"God Must Have My Fortune Laid Away"
God has my fortune laid away
Oh, the world is full of people with money just to burn
Affording all the things in life for which a man might yearn
Some can take life easy but I live from day by day
God has my fortune laid away
(Laid away)
I search for sunshine every day but there always comes the rain
The hope over my horizon was smoke without a flame
Pockets that stay empty, dreams that go astray
God has my fortune laid away
(God has my fortune laid away laid away, laid away)
Oh how often I have wondered why some things have to be
Some people live in riches while some live just like me
The more I try to work and save the more I have to pay
But God has my fortune laid away
(Laid away)
I search for sunshine every day but there always comes the rain
The hope over my horizon was smoke without a flame
Pockets that stay empty, dreams that go astray
God has my fortune laid away


"I Got Shoes"
I got shoes, you got shoes, all God's children got shoes
When I get to Heaven gonna put on my shoes
I'm gonna walk all over God's Heaven Heaven
Everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven
Ain't goin' there Heaven Heaven

Going play all over, gonna walk all over God's Heaven


"When I've Learned Enough To Die"
(When I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die old enough to die)
I've met the Master on my knees
I was tested I was tried
I've seen the God of heaven
Paint the fields and country side
I've been the husband of one wife
Heard my newborn baby cry
But when I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die old enough to die
I've always been a hard working man
No stopping place have I found
But when I'm tired I'm still inspired
At night when I lie down
I've learned to kinda like this earth
Some time I wonder why
Cause when I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die
Old enough to die
(When I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die old enough to die)
I've always been a hard working man
No stopping place have I found
But when I'm tired I'm still inspired
At night when I lie down
I've learned to kinda like this earth
Some time I wonder why
Cause when I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die
Old enough to die


"Let The Lower Lights Be Burning"
Brightly beams our Father's mercy from his lighthouse evermore
But to us he gives the keeping of the lights along the shore
Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save
Dark the night of sin has settled loud the angry billows roar
Eager eyes are watching longing for the lights along the shore
Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save
Trim your feeble lamp my brother, some poor sailor tempest tossed
Trying now to make the harbor in the darkness may be lost
Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save


"If We Never Meet Again"
Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey
And perhaps we'll never meet anymore
Til we gather in heaven's bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore
If we never meet again this side of heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven
By the river of life
Where the charming roses bloom forever
And where separation come no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore
Oh so often we are parted with sorrow
And action often quietens our pain
But we never shall sorrow in heaven
God be with you till we meet again


"When I Take My Vacation In Heaven"
There are those who are taking vacations
To the mountains the lakes and the sea
Where they rest from their cares and their troubles
What a wonderful time that must be
But it seems not my lot to be like them
I must toil through the heat and the cold
Seekin' out the lost sheep on a mountain
Bringing wanderers back to the fold
But when I take my vacation in Heaven
What a wonderful time that will be
Hearing concerts by the Heavenly chorus
And the face of my Saviour I'll see
Sitting down on the banks of the river
Neath the shade of the evergreen tree
There I'll rest from my burdens forever
Won't you take your vacation with me
Sitting down on the banks of the river
Under the shade of the evergreen tree
There I'll rest from my burdens forever
Won't you take your vacation with me


"Taller Than Trees"
On your knees you are taller than trees
You can look over heartaches and pain
When my faith is gone to my knees
I will go, growing stronger and taller than trees
One night it was a long time ago now
I knelt at my mother's knee
And she said
Son lift up your eyes to Him in the skies
And you'll grow like the mighty oaks
But you son, created in the image of God
Can become taller even taller than the tallest of trees
And this was the answer I felt
As down at her knees I knelt
On your knees you're taller than trees
You can look over all your heartaches
And son you can look over all of your pains
When my faith is gone to my knees
I will go, growing stronger and taller than trees


"I Won't Have To Cross Jordan Alone"
When I come to the river at the ending of day
When the last winds of sorrow have blown
There'll be somebody waiting to show me the way I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan alone Jesus died all my sins to atone
In the darkness I see he'll be waiting for me I won't have to cross Jordan alone
Often times I'm weary and troubled and sad
When it seems that my friends have all flon
There is one thought that cheers me and makes my heart glad
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan
Though the billows of trouble and sorrow may sweep
Christ the Saviour will care for his own
Till the end of my journey my soul he will keep and I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan


"When He Reached Down His Hand For Me"
(When he reached down his hand for me)
Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way I was wretched and vile as could be
But my Saviour in love gave me peace from above
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down his hand for me when he reached way down for me
I was lost and undone without my God or his son
When he reached down his hand for me
I was near to despair when he came to me there
And he showed me that I could be free
Then he lifted my feet gave me gladness complete
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down


"My God Is Real"
There are some things I may not know
There are some places I can't go
But I am sure of this one thing
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul
My God is real, real in my soul
My God is real for He has washed and made me whole
His love for me is like pure gold
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul
Some folks may doubt, some folks may scorn
Well, they can all go on, just leave me alone
But ask for me, I'll take God's part
My God is real for I can feel Him in my heart
My God is real, real in my soul
My God is real for He has washed and made me whole
His love for me is like pure gold
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul


"These Hands"
These hands aren't the hands of a gentleman
These hands are calloused and old
These hands raised a family, these hands built a home
Now these hands raised to praise the Lord
These hands won the heart of my loved one
And with hers they were never alone
If these hands filled their task then what more could you ask
For these fingers have worked to the bone
Now don't try to judge me by what you'd like me be
For my life hasn't been a success
Some people have power but still they grieve
While these hands brought me happiness
Now I'm tired and I'm old and I haven't much gold
Maybe things ain't been all that I planned
Lord above hear my plea when it's time to judge me
Take a look at these hard working hands
Take a look at these hard working hands


"Lost On The Desert"
A burnin' hot sun a cryin' for water black wings circle the sky
Stumblin' and fallin' somebody's callin' you're lost on the desert to die
I had to give up and they took me to jail but I hid all the money I got
Way out on the desert where no one could get it and I left a mark at the spot
Then I got away and I ran for the desert the devil had taken control
I needed water but he said I'd make it near the money is a big waterhole
A burnin' hot sun
Just up ahead is where I left my mark or it may be to the left or the right
I've been runnin' all day and they'll catch up tomorrow I've got to find it tonight
Then up jumped the devil and ran away laughin' he drank all the waterholes dry
He moved my mark till I'm running in circles and lost on the desert to die
A burnin' hot sun
(Lost on the desert to die) lost on the desert to die (lost on the desert to die)


"Accidentally On Purpose"
Accidentally I saw you this morning
You were lovely dressed in your wedding gown
And they say that you married a stranger to me
That had drifted to our old hometown
Accidentally you've met him one evening
And you say it was love at first sight
Accidentally on purpose you've married
Accidentally on purpose for spite
Cause I saw out cheatin' and runnin' around
And I was just a fool with a heart of a clown
Accidentally you were mistaken that night
Accidentally on purpose for spite
Cause I saw out cheatin'


"In The Jailhouse Now"
He's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice
To quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now
Well I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob
Who used to steal, gamble and rob
He thought he was the smartest guy in town
But I found out last Monday
That Bob got locked up Sunday
They got him in the jailhouse way down town
He's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice
To quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now
Well I went out last Tuesday
Met a girl named Susie
I told her I was the swellest man around
Well she started in to spend my money
She started in to call me honey
We took in every honky tonk in town
We're in the jailhouse now
We're in the jailhouse now
They told us once or twice
To quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
We're in the jailhouse now


"Mr. Lonesome"
I've got no fire inside of me can't be the man I try to be
Oh Mr Lonesome hanging round
Don't wanna see nobody don't wanna be nobody
Oh Mr Lonesome got me down
He makes me leave the party when folks are laughin' hearty
Happiness is one thing he can't stand
Nobody wants or needs me I go just where he leads me
Oh Mr Lonesome got my hand
And so my whole life over each day is like the other but still if my one wish could be
If that old chain that binds me breaks when true love finds me
And Mr Lonesome sets me free oh Mr Lonesome got me down


"You Won't Have Far To Go"
I can see now that you've stacked the cards so I leave you with my best regards
When you play to feel with nothing left to show look for me you won't have far to go
Love's a gamble and I'm a gamblin' man I've done everything to make you understand
But the odds are high and luck is running low look for me you won't have far to go
You won't have far to go if you want me cause I'm gonna stick close to you
And I'm not the kind to say I told you so look for me you won't have far to go
You won't have far to go


"In Them Old Cottonfields Back Home"
When I was a little bitty baby my mama would rock me in my cradle
In them old cottonfields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
Now when them cotton bolls get rotten you can't pick very much cotton
In them old cottonfields back home
It was down in Louisiana just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cottonfields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
When I was a little bitty baby
In them old cottonfields back home in them old cottonfields back home


"Delia's Gone"
Delia, oh, Delia Delia all my life
If I hadn't have shot poor
Delia I'd have had her for my wife
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
I went up to Memphis
And I met Delia there Found her in her parlor
And I tied to her chair
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
She was low down and trifling
And she was cold and mean
Kind of evil make me want to Grab my sub machine
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
First time I shot her I shot her in the side
Hard to watch her suffer
But with the second shot she died
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
But jailer, oh, jailer Jailer
I can't sleep 'Cause all around my bedside
I hear the patter of Delia's feet
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
So if you woman's devilish
You can let her run
Or you can bring her down and do her
Like Delia got done
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

"I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know"
You think you know the smile on her lips the thrill at the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss in each caress and each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You stole her love from me one day you didn't care how you've hurt me
But you can never steal away mem'ries of what used to be
You think she's yours to have and to hold
But someday you'll learn when her love grows cold
That I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You stole her love from me


"You Remembered Me"
You were young and needed love and I was wild and free
But every time you said a prayer you said a prayer for me
Why the ring upon your hand we vowed fidelity
There were times when I forgot but you remembered me
(There were times when I forgot but you remembered me)
You remembered only that wedding bells would ring
You remembered only to count the days till spring
You knew only love and honor but I couldn't see
I regret that I forgot cause you remembered me
(I regret that I forgot cause you remembered me)
I believed that promises were made to break apart
But every time I broke a vow I always broke your heart
So here's to you God bless you now wherever you may be
There were times that I forgot but you remembered me
(There were times that I forgot but you remembered me)
You remembered only that wedding bells would ring


"I'm Free From The Chain Gang Now"
I got rid of the shackles that bound me and the guards that were always around me
There were tears on the mail mother wrote me in jail
But I'm free from the chain gang now
All the years I was known and respected 'til one day I was wrongly suspected
I was shackled in chains in a cold freezin' rain but I'm free from the chain gang now
All the years I was known by a number how I kept my mind is a wonder
But like a bird in a tree I got my liberty and I'm free from the chain gang now
I got rid of the shackles that bound me and the guards that were always around me
There were tears on the mail mother sent me in jail
But I'm free from the chain gang now
There were tears on the mail mother wrote me in jail
But I'm free from the chain gang now

I'll just be one of millions who'll give the praise you get
And maybe every year or so I'll drop a card to you
To tell you I'm still listening so sing it pretty Sue


"The Legend Of John Henry's Hammer"
John Henry's Papy woke him up one midnight
He said before the sheriff comes I wanna tell you, listen boy
Said learn to ball a jack, learn to lay  a track, learn to pick and shovel too, and take my hammer, it'll do anything you tell it to
John Hery's mammie had about a dozen babies, John Henry's papie told tale about a dozen times
The babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money, he said I'll pay you quarter at a time, startin' tomorow, that's the pay for a steel driver on this line
Then the section foreman said hey hammer swinger, I see you brought your own hammer boy, but what else can all those muscles do
And he said, I can turn a jack, I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too
(can you swing a hammer boy
I can I'll do anything you hire me to
Now ain't you something so high and mighty with your muscles, just go ahead pick up that hammer, pick up the hammer
He said get a rusty spike and swing it down three times, I'll pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to, go on and do what you say you can do
With a steep nose hammer on a four foot switch panel, John Henry raised it back till it touched his heels, then the spike went through the cross tie and it split it half in two, 35 cents a day for driven steel
(sweat sweat boy, sweat, you owe me two more swings)
I was born for driven steel
Well John Henry hammered in the mountain, he'd give a grunt and he'd give groan with every swing, the women folks for miles around, heard him and come down, to watch him make the cold steel ring, Lord what a swinger, just listen to that cold steel ring
But the bad boss come up laughing at John Henry, said you full of vinegar now, but you bout through, were gonna get a steam drill to do your share of drivin, then what's all them muscles gonna do, huh John Henry, gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you
John Henry said I feed four little brothers, and  my baby sister's walking on her knees, did the Lord say that machines awtta take the place of living, and what's a subsitute for bread and beans, I ain't seen it, do engines get rewarded for their steam
John Henry hid in a coal mine for his dinner now, had thirty minutes to rest before the bell, the mine boss hollered get up whoever you are and get a pick ax, give me enough coal to start another hill, and keep it burning, mine me enough to start another hill
John Henry said to his captain, a man ain't nothin but a man, but if you bring that steam drill round, I'll beat it fair and honest, I'll die with my hammer in my hand, but I'll be laughing, cuz you can't replace a steel driven man
There was a big crowd of people at the mountain, John Henry said to the steam drill how is you, pardon me mister steam drill, I suppose you didn't hear me, I said how you, well can you turn a jack, can you lay a track, can you pick and shovel too, listen this hammer swingers talkin' to you
2000 people hollered go John Henry, then somebody hollered the mountain's caving in, John Henry told the captain, tell the kind folks not to worry, that ain't nothin but my hammer suckin' wind, keeps me breathing, a steel drivers muscle I intend

"Busted"
My bills are all due and the babies need shoes
But I'm Busted
Cotton's gone down to a quarter a pound
And I'm Busted
I got a cow that's gone dry
And a hen that won't lay
A big stack of bills
Getting bigger each day
The county's gonna haul my belongings away
But I'm Busted
So I called on my brother to ask for a loan
Cause I was Busted
I hate to beg like a dog for a bone
But I'm Busted
My brother said
there's not a thing I can do
My wife and my kids
Are all down with the flu
And I was just thinkin' about callin' on you
Cause I'M Busted
Lord, I ain't no thief, but a man can go wrong
When he's Busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone
But I'm Busted
Now the fields are all bare
And the cotton won't grow
Me and my family's gotta pack up and go
But I'll make a living, just where, I don't know
Cause I'm Busted


"Casey Jones"
Come all you rounders if you wanna hear the story about a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the roller's name on a 68 wheeler course he won his fame
Caller called Casey bout half past four he kissed his wife at the station door
He climbed in the cabin with his orders in his hand
Said this is the trip to the Promised Land
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin Casey Jones orders in his hand
Casey Jones leanin' out the window taking a trip to the Promised Land
Through South Memphis Yards on a fly rain been a fallin' and the water was high
Everybody knew by the engine's moan that the man at the throttle was Casey Jones
Well Jones said fireman now don't you fret Sam Webb said we ain't a givin' up yet
We're eight hours late with the southbound mail
We'll be on time or we're leavin' the rails
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
Dead on the rail was a passenger train blood was a boilin' in Casey's brain
Casey said hey now look out ahead jump Sam jump or we'll all be dead
With a hand on a whistle and a hand on a brake north Mississippi was wide awake
I see railroad official said he's a good engineer to be a laying dead
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
Headaches and heartaches and all kinds of pain all the part of a railroad train
Sweat and toil the good and the grand part of the life of a railroad man
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin


"Nine Pound Hammer"
Well, this nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
For my size, honey for my size
I'm goin' on the mountain, gonna see my baby
And I ain't comin' back, Lord I ain't comin' back
Oh, roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
How can I go when my wheels won't roll
Roll on buddy, pull a load o'coal
How can I go when my wheels won't roll
Well, it's a long way to Harlem, it's a long way to Hazard
Just to get a little brew, just to get a little brew
Now when I'm long gone you can make my tombstone
Out of number nine coal, out of number nine coal
Roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
How can I go when my wheels won't roll
Oh, roll on buddy, pull a load o'coal
How can I go when my wheels won't roll


"Chain Gang"
I was just a kid roamin' around
Travelin' through, a little ol' town
A man walked up and said come with me
You're broke and son that's vagrancy
A carefree lad that love to roam
But Lord I wish I'd stayed at home
The way it looks I'll probably hang
Cause there ain't no hope on a chain gang
I dig that ditch, I chop that corn
I curse the day that I was born
I believe it's better for a man to hang
Than to work like a dog on a chain gang
The guard stands there with a great big gun
I bet he'd love to see me run
And I guess, I probably will some day
I'd rather be dead than to live this way
He's well fed and he's six foot tall
And he's a meanest of them all
He cracks that whip and he swings that cane
That sun must've touched his brain
I dig that ditch, I chop that corn
I curse the day that I was born
I believe it's better for a man to hang
Than to work like a dog on a chain gang
I got a gal back home that's sweet and kind
But she's been waitin' a long, long time
I just told her to forget my name
I won't ever live down the shame
Lord, deliver me from this hole
Before I lose my mind and soul
The flesh gets weak and the back gets broke
There ain't no 'cause to laugh and joke
I dig that ditch, I chop that corn
I curse the day that I was born
I believe it's better for a man to hang
Than to work like a dog on a chain gang
Work like a dog on a chain gang
Work like a dog on a chain gang
Work like a dog on a chain gang


"Waiting For A Train"
All around the water tank waitin' for a train
A thousand miles away from home sleeping in the rain
I walked up to a brakeman just to give him a line of talk
He said if you've got money I'll see that you don't walk
Well I haven't got a nickel not a penny can I show
He said get off you railroad bum and he slammed the boxcar door
Well he put me off in Texas a place I dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me the moon and stars above
Nobody seems to want me nor to lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco headin' back to Dixie Land
My pocketbook is empty my heart is willed with pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home just waitin' for a train


"Roughneck"
Born to be a roughneck
I'll never amount to nothin'
Pullin' case and layin' pipe
Is hard labor
Well, I was born in a boomer shack
Bout a half mile from town
Papa was a driller on a wildcat crew
And my mama never was around
I learn to cuss when I was two
And fight when I was three
And by the time I was five there was no kid alive
Could ever get the best of me
Born to be a roughneck
I'll never amount to nothin'
Pullin' case and layin' pipe
Is hard labor
Well, I started workin' like a regular man
When I was just about knee high
Skinning the knuckles with my two bare hands
But they never heard me cry
I remember walkin' down the road
And hearin' somebody say
He was born to live a rougneck's life
And he's never gonna change his ways
Born to be a roughneck
I'll never amount to nothin'
Pullin' case and layin' pipe
Is hard labor
Born to be a roughneck
I'll never amount to nothin'
Pullin' case and layin' pipe
Is hard labor


"The Christmas Spirit"
Praises sing to Christ the King
And peace to men on earth
On Christmas Eve I dreamed I traveled all around the earth
And in my dream I saw and heard the ways the different people
Hail the king whose star shone in the east and what a dream it was
In London Town I walked around Piccadilly Circus
A mass of people movin' here and there, I wondered where
On every face at every place was
Hurry up, I'm late
But a kind old man at a chestnut stand said
Merry Christmas mate
And I felt the Christmas spirit
In a little town nestled down in Bavaria Germany
I walked along to see what the feeling there would be
And here again was the busy din, the rushin', the yellin'
But some kind boy said
Frohliche Weihnachten
Not understanding the words but gettin' the buyin' and sellin'
I felt the Christmas spirit
In Bethlehem I heard a hymn, some distant choir sang
And with other tourists I walked along to a Church as its bells rang
Then I heard someone tell someone
There's where Christ was born
I wonder if He looked like our baby looked on that first morn
And then I really felt the Christmas spirit
From a businessman in the Holy Land at a sidewalk souvenirshop
I bought a little Bible since I'd already stopped
And it was in Paris France somehow by chance that I took the Bible out
As I flipped the pages I saw these words
And I knew what it was all about
For I read
Fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy
Which shall be to all people
For unto you He was born this day in the City of David, a Saviour
Which is Christ the Lord
Then I took the little Holy Book, held it close and tight
I closed my eyes and visualized the glory of that night
So suddenly it came to me for when I awoke on Christmas Day
I felt the Christmas spirit down deep inside to stay
O little town of Bethlehem how still we see Thee lie
Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in Thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in Thee tonight


"I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day"
I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth goodwill to men
I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along unbroken song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men
And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong that mocks the song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doubt He sleeps
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth goodwill to men
Till ringin' singin' on its way
The world revolve from night to day
A voice a chime a chance so blind
Of peace on earth goodwill to men
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doubt He sleeps
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth goodwill to men
Classic Christmas


"Blue Christmas"
I'll have a blue blue Christmas
I'll have a blue blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red, on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when those blue blue heartaches start hurtin'
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red, on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when those blue heartaches start hurtin'
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas
A blue blue Christmas without you


"The Gifts They Gave"
Jesus our King, kind and good
Was humbly born in a stable of wood
And the lowly beasts around Him stood
Jesus our King, kind and good
said the donkey, shaggy and brown
I carried His mother up and down
I carried His mother to Bethlehem town
said the donkey, shaggy and brown
said the ox
This was my hay
I gave Him my manger, 'twas here that He lay
I gave Him my manger, 'twas here that He lay
said the ox
This was my hay
said the sheep with pearly horn
I gave Him my wool for a blanket warm
He wore my coat on Christmas morn
said the sheep with pearly horn
said the dove, from the rafters high
I sang Him to sleep that He would not cry
We sang Him to sleep, my love and I
said the dove, from the rafters high
And so every heart, by some good spell
In the stable dark, was glad to tell
Of the gift that he gave to Emmanuel
Of the gift that he gave to Emmanuel


"Here Was A Man"
(Joy to the world, the Lord is come)
Here was a man, a man
Who was born in a small village
The son of a peasant woman
He grew up in another small village
Until he reached the age of thirty
He worked as a carpenter
Then for three years
He was a traveling minister
But he never traveled more
Than two hundred miles from
Where he was born and
Where he did go he usually walked
He never held political office
He never wrote a book
Never bought a home
Never had a family
He never went to college
And he never set foot inside a big city
Yes, here was a man
Though he never did one on the things
Usually associated with greatness
He had no credentials but himself
He had nothing to do with this world
Except through the divine purpose
That brought him to this world
While he was still a young man
The tide of popular opinion turned against him
Most of his friends ran away
One of them denied him
One of them betrayed him
And turned him over to his enemies
Then he went through the mockery of a trial
And was nailed to a cross between two thieves
And even while he was dying
His executioners gambled
For the only piece of property
That he had in this world
And that was his robe his purple robe
When he was dead
He was taken down from the cross
And laid in a borrowed grave
Provided by compassionate friends
More than nineteen centuries have come and gone
And today he's a centerpiece of the human race
Our leader in the column to human destiny
I think, I'm well within the mark when I say
That all of the armies that ever marched
All of the navies that ever sailed the seas
All of the legislative bodies that ever sat
And all of the kings that ever reigned
All of them put together have not affected
The life of man on this earth
So powerfully as that one solitary life
Here was a man
(Joy to the world, the Lord is come)


"Christmas As I Knew It"
One day near Christmas when I was just a child
Mama called us together and mama tried to smile
She said you know the cotton crop hadn't been too good this year
There's not a lot of spending money and well at least we're all here
I hope you won't expect a lot of Christmas presents
Just be thankful that there is plenty to eat
That'll make things a little more pleasant
And us kids got to thinking how really blessed we were
At least we were all healthy and most of all we had her
Roy cut down a pine oak tree and we drug it home Jack and me
Daddy killed a squirrel and Louise made the bread
Reba decorated the tree with popcorn strings before we went to bed
Mama and daddy sacrificed because this Christmas was kind of lean
After all there was the babies Tom and Joanne
And babies need a few things
I whittled a whistle for my brother Jack
And though we disagreed now and then
When I gave Jack that whistle he knew I thought the world of him
Mama made the girl's dresses out of flower sacks
And when she ironed them down
You couldn't tell that they hadn't come from town
A sharecropper family across the road didn't have it as good as us
They didn't even have a light and it was way past dusk
And mama said
Well I bet they don't even have coal oil
Let alone apples and oranges and such
Me and Jack took a jar of coal oil nd some hickernuts we'd found
We walked to the sharecropper's porch and set 'em down
A poor old ragged lady eased open the door
She picked up the coal oil and hickernuts and said
I sure do thank you
and quickly closed the door
We started back home me and Jack
And about halfway we stopped looked back
And in the sharecropper's window at last was a light
So for one of the neighbors and for us it was a good Christmas night
Christmas came and Christmas went
Christmas that year was heaven sent
And my daddy put on his rubber boots
And paced the floor waiting for the thaw
Back home in Dyess Arkansas
Johnny Cash Family Christmas

"The Little Drummer Boy"
Come they told me
Our newborn King to see
Our finest gifts we bring
To lay before the King
This is to honor Him
When we come
Baby Jesus, I am a poor boy too
I have no gift to bring
That's fit to give a King
But may I play for You
On my drum
The Mother Mary nodded
The ox and lamb kept time
I played my drum for Him
I played my best for Him
Then He smiled at me
Me and my drum


"Ringing The Bells For Jim"
The father heard church bells at midnight
A wrong time for church bells to chime
He went to the tower, found a little girl there
Said
Why ring the bells at this time
I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
I'm sorry, I'm cryin' but my brother Jim's dyin'
So, I'm ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, pray for him this Christmas
He's sick and he's in so much pain
The doctors all say, he'll be gone any day
So, I must ring the bells again
I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
I'm sorry, I'm cryin' but my brother Jim's dyin'
So, I'm ringing the bells for Jim
On the day after Christmas
She brought him said
Father, heed little Jim
You see, he got well, when he heard the church bells
I was ringing the bells for Jim
I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
I'm sorry, I'm cryin' but my brother Jim's dyin'
So, I'm ringing the bells for Jim


"We Are The Shepherds"
So here is the stable and there is the manger
The new Saviour sleeps on His first earthly night
The wise men brought riches but we brought a candle
It's all that we have but it gives a good light
We are the shepherds we walked cross the mountains
We left our flocks when the new star appeared
Oh, the beautiful singin' of heavenly choir
We had to come see Him, we had to come here
We beg You forgive us for such a small offering
But our sheep are out there with wolves in the night
We bring You this candle it's all we have with us
But with it the new Saviour has His first light
We are the shepherds
We thank Thee kind Joseph for bidding us enter
Please take our gift for the new babe to thine
Tis only one candle but it is our symbol
Of how we believe that His great life will shine
We are the shepherds


"Who Kept The Sheep"
The shepherds afar left their flocks by night
Followed the new star by its heavenly light
Did the lambs fear the wolves
Did they lay down and sleep
Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep
Did robbers not steal or did they fear the light
That the shepherds had followed night after night
Did they not stray
Did little lambs weep
Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep
Under the new star, the new Saviour lay in his dim manger
He lay on the hay
The shepherds that came had a vigil to keep
But who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep


"Ballad Of The Harp Weaver"
Son said my mother when I was knee high
You need of clothes to cover you and not a rag have I
There's nothing in the house to make a boy's britches
Nor shears to cut a cloth with nor thread to take stitches
There's nothing in the house but a leaf end of rye
And the harp with a with the woman's head nobody will by and she began to cry
That was in the early fall and when came the late fall
Son she said the sight of you makes your mother's blood crawl
Little skinny shoulder blades stickin' through your clothes
And where you get a jacket from God above knows
It's lucky for me lad your daddy's in the ground
And can't see the way I let his son go around and she made a queer sound
That was in the late fall when the winter came
I'd not a pair of bridges nor a shirt to my name
I couldn't go to school or out of doors to play
And all the other little boys passed our way
Son said my mother come climb into my lap
And I'll chave your little knees while you take a nap
And oh but we were silly for half an hour or more
Me with my long legs draggin' on the floor
I rocked rocked rocked to a mother goose rhyme
Oh but we were happy for half an hour's time
But there was I a great boy and what would folks say
To hear my mother singin' me to sleep all day in such a daft way
Men say the winter was bad that year fuel was scarce and food was dear
A wind with a wolf's head howled about our door
And we burned up the chairs and sat upon the floor
All that was left us was a chair we couldn't break
And the harp with the woman's head nobody would take for song or pity sake
The night before Christmas I cried with the cold
I cried myself to sleep like a two year old
And in the deep night I felt my mother rise
And stare down upon me with love in her eyes
I saw my mother sitting on the one good chair
A light falling on her face from I couldn't tell where
Looking nineteen and not a day older
And the harp with the woman's head leaned against her shoulder
Her thin fingers moving in the thin tall strings
Were weave weave weaving wonderful things
Many bright threads from where I couldn't see
Were running through the harp strings rapidly
And gold threads whistlin' through my mother's hands
I saw the web grow and the pattern expand
She wove a child's jacket and when it was done
She laid it on the floor and wove another one
She wove a red cloak so regal to see
She's made it for a king's son I said and not for me but I knew it was for me
She wove a pair of bridges and quicker than that
She wove a pair of boots a little cocked hat
She wove a pair of mittens she wove a little blouse
She wove all night in the still cold house
She sang as she worked and the harp strings spoke
But her voice never faltered and the thread never broke
But when I awoke there sat my mother
With the harp against her shoulder lookin' nineteen and not a day older
A smile about her lips and a light about her head
And her hands in the harp strings frozen dead
And piled up beside her toppling to the skies
Were the clothes of a king's son just my size
The Christmas Spirit


"As Long As The Grass Shall Grow"
As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow
The Senecas are an Indian tribe of the Iroquios nation
Down on the New York Pennsylvania Line you'll find their reservation
After the US revolution cornplanter was a chief
He told the tribe these men they could trust that was his true belief
He went down to Independence Hall and there was a treaty signed
That promised peace with the USA and Indian rights combined
George Washington gave his signature the Government gave its hand
They said that now and forever more that this was Indian land
As long as the moon shall rise
On the Seneca reservation there is much sadness now
Washington's treaty has been broken and there is no hope no how
Across the Allegheny River they're throwing up a dam
It will flood the Indian country a proud day for Uncle Sam
It has broke the ancient treaty with a politician's grin
It will drown the Indians graveyards cornplanter can you swim
The earth is mother to the the Senecas they're trampling sacred ground
Change the mint green earth to black mud flats as honor hobbles down
As long as the moon shall rise
The Iroquios Indians used to rule from Canada way south
But no one fears the Indians now and smiles the liar's mouth
The Senecas hired an expert to figure another site
But the great good army engineers said that he had no right
Although he showed them another plan and showed them another way
They laughed in his face and said no deal Kinuza dam is here to stay
Congress turned the Indians down brushed off the Indians plea
So the Senecas have renamed the dam they call it Lake Perfidy
As long as the moon shall rise
Washington Adams and Kennedy now hear their pledges ring
The treaties are safe we'll keep our word but what is that gurgling
It's the back water from Perfidy Lake it's rising all the time
Over the homes and over the fields and over the promises fine
No boats will sail on Lake Perfidy in winter it will fill
In summer it will be a swamp and all the fish will kill
But the Government of the USA has corrected George's vow
The father of our country must be wrong what's an Indian anyhow
As long as the moon shall rise (look up) as long as the rivers flow (are you thirsty)
As long as the sun will shine (my brother are you warm) as long as the grass shall grow


"Apache Tears"
Hoof prints and foot prints, deep ruts the wagons made
The victor and the loser came by here
No head stones, but these bones bring the mascalero death moans
See the smooth black nuggets by the thousands lying here
Petrified, but justified are these apache tears
Dead grass, dry roots, hunger crying in the night
Ghost of broken hearts and laws are here
And who saw the young squaw, they judged by their whiskey law
Tortured till she died of pain and fear
Where the soldiers lay her back, are the black apache tears
The young men, the old men, the guilty and the innocent
Bled red blood and chilled alike with fears
The red men, the white men, no fight ever took this land
So don't raise the dust when you pass here
They're sleeping and in my keeping are these apache tears


"Custer"
Now I will tell you buster that I ain't a fan of Custer
And the General he don't ride well anymore
To some he was a hero but to me his score was zero
And the General he don't ride well anymore
Now Custer done his fightin' without too much excitin'
And the General he don't ride well anymore
General Custer come in pumpin' when the men were out a huntin'
But the General he don't ride well anymore
With victories he was swimmin' he killed children dogs and women
But the General he don't ride well anymore
Crazy Horse sent out the call to Sitting Bull and Gall
And the General he don't ride well anymore
Now Custer split his men well he won't do that again
Cause the General he don't ride well anymore
Twelve thousand warriors waited they were unanticipated
And the General he don't ride well anymore
It's not called an Indian victory but a bloody massacre
And the General he don't ride well anymore
There might have been more enthusin' if us Indians had been losin'
But the General he don't ride well anymore
General George A.Custer oh his yellow hair had lustre
But the General he don't ride well anymore
For now the General's silent he got barbered violent
And the General he don't ride well anymore
Oh the General he don't ride well anymore


"The Talking Leaves"
Sequoia's winters were sixteen silent tongue spirit clean
He walked at his father's side
Across the smoking battle ground where red and white men lay all around
So many here had died
The wind had scattered around snow white leaves upon the ground
Not leaves like leaves from trees
Sequoia said what can this be what's the strange thing here I see
From where come leaves like these
Sequoia turned to his father's eyes and he said father you're wise
From where come such snow white leaves
With such strange marks upon these squares
Not even the wise owl could put them there
So strange these snow white leaves
His father shielding his concern resenting the knowledge Sequoia yearned
Crumbled the snow white leaves
He said when I explain then it's done these are talking leaves my son
The white men's talking leaves
The white man takes a berry of black and red
And an eagle's feather from the eagle's bed
And he makes bird track marks
And the marks on the leaves they say carry messages to his brother far away
And his brother knows what's in his heart
They see these marks and they understand the truth in the heart of the far off man
The enemies can't hear them
Said Sequoia's father son they weave bad medicine on these talking leaves
Leave such things to them
Then Sequoia walking lightly followed his father quietly but so amazed was he
If the white man talks on leaves why not the Cherokee
Vanished from his father's face Sequoia went from place to place
But he could not forget
Year after year he worked on and on till finally he cut into stone
The Cherokee alphabet
Sequoia's hair by now was white his eyes began to lose their light
But he taught all who would believe
That the Indian's thoughts could be written down
Just as the white men's there on the ground and he left us these talking leaves


"The Ballad Of Ira Hayes"
Ira Hayes
Ira Hayes
[CHORUS:]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land
Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
Till the white man stole the water rights
And the sparklin' water stopped
Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed
[CHORUS:]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty
And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes
[CHORUS:]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
Ira returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored
But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no crops, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance
[CHORUS:]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
Then Ira started drinkin' hard
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
like you'd throw a dog a bone
He died drunk one mornin'
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes
[CHORUS:]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lyin' thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died


"Drums"
From the Indian reservation to the governmental school
Well they're goin' to educate me to the white men's Golden Rule
And I'm learning very quickly for I've learned to be ashamed
And I come when they call Billy though I've got an Indian name
And there are drums beyond the mountain Indian drums that you can't hear
There are drums beyond the mountain and they're getting mighty near
And when they think that they'd changed me cut my hair to meet their needs
Will they think I'm white or Indian quarter blood or just half breed
Let me tell you Mr teacher when you say you'll make me right
In five hundred years of fighting not one Indian turned white
And there are drums
Well you thought that I knew nothing when you brought me here to school
Just another empty Indian just America's first fool
But now I can tell you stories that are burnt and dried and old
But in the shadow of their telling walks the thunder proud and bold
And there are drums
Long Pine and Sequoia Handsome Lake and Sitting Bull
There's Magnus Colorado with his sleeves so red and full
Crazy Horse the legend those who bit off Custer's soul
They are dead yet they are living with the great Geronimo
And there are drums
Well you may teach me this land's hist'ry but we taught it to you first
We broke your hearts and bent your journeys broken treaties left us cursed
Even now you have to cheat us even though you this us tame
In our losing we found proudness in your winning you found shame
And there are drums


"White Girl"
I am stunned and I am broken and my head is in my hand
For she who said she love me will not wed an Indian man
My Gods who were wild ridden stand quiet by my side
For although I loved her she would not be my bride
Oh goodbye softly sweet one it was splended while it ran
Goodbye my bitter white girl I'll forget you if I can
She came up to the pueblo with her bright blonde hair
They told me not to love her but I did not care
She took me to her parties she carried me around
And I was a proud one the tallest man in town
For I found great wonder all wrapped in brilliant dreams
I held her strong but gentle as kings have held their queens
I learned to drink strong whiskey as she took me here and there
Until life without my whiskey I could not bear
Oh goodbye softly sweet one
Well when she came to leave me she took me by the arm
And she said she loved me and would not do me harm
But she would not marry not an Indian she said
She thanked me for my offer and I wished that I was dead
Now I'm back among my people and they are kind to me
Although I'm sad with staggers when I drink that tough whiskey
For I've been a white girl's pet a captive Indian
Shown off and discarded just a drunk who might have been
Oh goodbye softly sweet one
Goodbye softly sweet one


"The Vanishing Race"
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
Oh wagon trains rollin' along they fade from my visions and in time will be gone
I see an eagle in space my people will follow oh oh a vanishing race
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
An Indian brave rolled along one day on a lonely mountain trail
And he gazed below with a heart of woe where the prairie schooners sail
A vision formed like a mortal storm in the dust of the wagon train
A vanishing race appeared in space and he sang his sad refrain
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
Oh wagon trains rollin' along
Oh now great spirits on high please spare them the sorrow you show to my eye oh oh
Now my blankets are roll and I ride to the valley of the brave Navajo oh oh
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
And I ride to the valley of the brave Navajo oh oh
Oh oh a vanishing Navajo oh the vanishing Navajo

"Orange Blossom Special"
Look a
Comin' down that railroad track
Hey, look a
Comin' down that railroad track
It's the Orange Blossom Special
Bringin' my baby back
Well, I'm going down to Florida
And get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe Californy
And get some sand in my shoes
I'll ride that Orange Blossom Special
And lose these New York blues
Say man, when you going back to Florida
When am I goin' back to Florida
Ain't you worried about getting your nourishment in New York
Well, I don't care if I do
Hey talk about a
She's the fastest train on the line
Talk about a
She's the fastest train on the line
It's that Orange Blossom Special
Rollin' down the seaboard line


"Long Black Veil"
Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me
The judge said: Son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Oh, the scaffold is high, and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me


"It Ain't Me Babe"
Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe
Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only let you down
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes to you
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe
You say you're lookin' for someone
To pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
And will love you for your life
And nothin' more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

"The Wall"
There's a lot of strange men in cell block ten
But the strangest of em' all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Starin at the wall
Starin at the wall
In his hand was a note that his gal had wrote
Proving crime don't pay
Was the very same gal he robbed and stole for
Wanting thier wedding day
Wanting thier wedding day
As he looked at the wall
So strong and tall
I heard him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
But I'm gonna be the first
I'm gonna be the first
Then the warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
Cause there is no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall
If you ever touch that wall
Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall
He never made that wall
Well there's never been a man who shook this camp
But I knew a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
But I know it was suicide
I know it was suicide


"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter, anyhow
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
Don't think twice, it's all right
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
So don't think twice, it's all right
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
Like you never did before
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
I can't hear you any more
I'm a
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right
I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, gal
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right


"You Wild Colorado"
Oh you wild raging river like my woman's lips you lure me
Pied piper of the desert roll on to the sea
You're the same at noon or midnight and I follow where you go
But you're planning no returning you wild Colorado
If I had no love of life I'd become part of your flow
But I fear the place you'd take me you wild Colorado
Oh you wild raging river from the fountains of the mountains
You ripple down the valleys growing wide and swift and deep
With what powed you cut your canyons how long ago
You're as wayward as my woman you wild Colorado
If I had no love of life


"Mama, You've Been On My Mind"
When you wake up in the morning baby look inside your mirror
I won't be next to you you know I won't be near
I'd be curious to know if your reflection is as clear
As the one that I've got on my mind mama you been on my mind
Well perhaps it's the wind and the dark dark night that's covering
The crossroads that I'm at
And maybe it's the weather somethin' like that
Byt mama you been on my mind mama you been on my mind
Well I don't need trouble please don't put me down or get upset
I am not pleading I won't say I'll forget
And I won't pace a floor bout down and bent but yet
Mama you been on my mind mama you been on my mind
Even though my mind is hazy and my thoughts are kinda narrow
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow
It don't matter to me where you'll be waking up tomorrow
Byt mama you been on my mind mama you been on my mind


"When It's Springtime In Alaska"
I mushed from Port Barrol through a blizzard of snow
Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks, the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon
When I walked in the door, the music was clear
Prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below
It was red headed Luie that was singing so sweet
I reached down and took the snow packs off of my feet
I reached for the gal that was singing the tune
We did the Eskimo hop all around the saloon
Where the caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug
We did our dance on a Kodiak rug
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below
Well, I was as innocent as I could be
I didn't know that Luie was big Ed's wife to be
He took out his knife and he gave it a throw
When it's springtime in Alaska, I'll be six feet below


"All Of God's Children Ain't Free"
I'd sing more about moral of this land but all God's children ain't free
I'd open up every door I can cause all God's children ain't free
I met a beaten broken man he shovels dirt but got no land
And he held out his hand to me all God's children ain't free
I'd sing along too a silly song but all God's children ain't free
I'm gonna sing the blues for the men they done wrong
Cause all God's children ain't free
Mister how bout the man you condemn to die
But taking everything that he's livin' by
And reject him from society all God's children ain't free
No reject him from society all God's children ain't free
I'd be happy walking any street but all God's children ain't free
I'd have a smile for all I meet but all God's children ain't free
I'd whistle down the road but I wouldn't feel right
I'd hear somebody cryin' out at night
From a sharecropper shack or penitentiary all God's children ain't free
From a sharecropper shack or penitentiary all God's children ain't free


"Danny Boy"
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the flowers are dying
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so
But if you come, when all the flowers are dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an
ave
there for me
And I will know, though soft you tread above me
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be
And you'll bend down and tell me that you love me
And I will rest in peace until you come to me

"Wildwood Flower"
Oh I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtles so bright with the emerald dew
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue
I will dance I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart in her crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming my idols were clay
All portions of love had all blown away
Oh she taught me to leave her and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
She left me no warning no words of farewell
Yes she taught me to love her and call me her flower
That was blooming to cheer her through life's dreary hour
Oh I long to see her and regret the dark hour
She's gone and neglected her pale wildwood flower

At the temple (amen) there they found him (amen)

"Engine 143"
Along came the F15 the swiftest on the line
Running o'er the C
O road just twenty minutes behind
Running into Cevile head porters on the line
Receiving their strict orders from a station just behind
Georgie's mother came to him with a bucket on her arm
Saying my darling son be careful how you run
Many a man has lost his life by trying to make lost time
And if you run your engine right you'll get there just on time
Up the road she darted against the rocks she crushed
Upside down the engine turned and Georgie's breast did smash
His head was against the firebox door the flames were rolling high
I'm glad I was born to be an engineer on the C
O road to die
The doctor said to Georgie my darling son be still
Your life may yet be saved if it is God's blessed will
Oh no said George that will not do I want to die so free
I want to die for the engine I love one hundred and forty three
The doctor said to Georgie your life cannot be saved
Murdered upon a railroad and laid in a lonesome grave
His face was covered up with blood his eyes you could not see
And the very last words that Georgie said was nearer my God to thee


"(I'm Proud) The Baby Is Mine"
Now don't laugh at the condition the lady's in
She soon could wear a cocktail dress again
But we get along without cocktails, mighty fine
This will be our first and I'm proud the baby is mine
Yes, I married her although I knew the kind of life she used to live
And 'cause I knew she loved me too, it was easy to forgive
And if you just mind your own business we'd be fine
Don't ever doubt I'm proud the baby is mine
She's awkward, yeah, but have you seen her face
Where there once was shame there's a sparkle in it's place
And her conscience is clear that's why her eyes shine
Mister don't ever doubt I'm proud the baby is mine
I married her although I knew the kind of life she used to live
And 'cause I knew she loved me too, it was easy to forgive
If you'd mind your own business we'd make it fine
Tell all her old friends I'm proud the baby is mine


"Hiawatha's Vision"
On the shores of Gitchgoomy by the shining big sea water
Hiawatha old and greyin' listened to the older prophet listened to lagu
And the young men and the women from the land of Ojibways
From the land of the Dakotas from the woodlands and the prairies
Stood and listened to the prophet heard lagu tell Hiawatha
I have seen he said a water bigger that the big sea water
Broader than the Gitchgoomy bitter so that none cold drink it
Salty so that none would use it
Hiawatha then spoke to them stopped all their jeering and their jesting
And he spoke to all the people
It's true what lagu tells you for I have seen it in a vision
I have also seen the water to the East to the land of morning
And upon this great water came a strange canoe with pinions
Bigger than a grove of pine trees taller than the tallest tree tops
And upon this great canoe were sails to carry it swiftly
And it carried many people strange and foreign were these people
And white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered
Then said Hiawatha I beheld a darker vision
Many hundreds came behind them pushed their way across our prairies
In our woodlands rang their axes in our valleys smoked their cities
Our people were all scattered all forgetful of our councils
Left their homelands going westward wild and woeful
And the man with bearded faces the men with skin so fair
With their barking sticks of thunder drove the remnants of our people
Farther westward westward westward then wild wild and wilder
Grew the West that once was ours


"The Road To Kaintuck"
We're goin' west to Kaintuck down the road to Moccasin Gap
Down the wilderness road
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap
There was a time when goin' way out west meant goin' to Kaintuck
The dark and bloody ground as Indians called it
Indians wars were ragin' and men like Daniel Boone and Michael Stoner
Came down the wilderness road like countless families did
Through a place in south West Virginia called Big Moccasin Gap
It's a hot day in '73 and this is my wife and my kids with me
Daniel Boone lost his boy the other day young Jim Boone is dead twenty miles away
The wagons turn and went back home even Daniel couldn't make it alone
I guess prob'ly Daniel could but he stopped awhile in castle wood
(If you love your wife and love your baby man
Turn your wagons back as soon as you can
Ev'ry Injun in these hills has gone berserk you never gonna make it to Kaintuck)
Ah I bet I'm gonna make it to Kaintuck
We're goin' west to Kaintuck down the road to Moccasin Gap
Down the wilderness road
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap

"The Shifting Whispering Sands, Part I"
I discovered the Valley of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
While prospecting in a western state
I saw the silent windmills, the crumbling water tanks
The bones of the cattle picked clean by buzzards
Bleached by the desert sun
I stumbled over a crumbling buck board
Nearly covered by the sand
And stopping to rest I heard a tinkling, whispering sound
And suddenly realized that even though the wind was quiet
The sand did not lie still
I seemed to be surrounded be a mystery
So heavy and apperceive I could scarcely breath
For weeks I wondered aimlessly in the valley
Seeking answers to the many questions that raced through my mind
Where was everyone
The barren valley where people must have lived and died
I sat down and buried my face in my hands
And resting I learned the secret of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
How I managed to escape from the valley I don't know
But now to pay my debt for being saved
I must tell you what I learned out on the desert
So many years ago
When the day is oddly quiet
And the breeze seems not to blow
One would think the sun is resting
But you'll find this is not so
It is whispering softly whispering
As it slowly moves along
And for those who stop and listen
It will sing this mournful song
Of sidewinders and the horn toads
On the thorny chaparral
In the sunny days and moonlight lights
The lonely coyotes yell
How the stars seem they can touch you
As you lay and gaze on high
At the heavens where your hoping
You'll be going when you die


"The Ballad Of Boot Hill"
Here lies less more
Four slugs from a forty
No less no more
Out in Arizona just south of Tucson
Where tumbleweeds tumble in search of a home
There's a town they call Tombstone where the brave never cry
They live by a sixgun by a sixgun they die
It's been a long time now since the town was a boom
The jailhouse is empty so's the Palace Saloon
Just one look will tell you that this town was real
A secluded old dirt road leads up to Boot Hill
Walk up to the fence there and look at the view
That's where they were hanging eighteen eighty two
It's easy to see where the brave men have died
Rope marks on the oak tree are now petrified
At night when the moon shines so far away
It gets mighty lonesome lookin' down on their graves
There lies Billy Clanton never wanted to kill
But he's there with the guilty way up on Boot Hill (Boot Hill)


"I Ride An Old Paint"
I ride an old paint, I lead an old dan
I'm goin' to Montana to throw the hoolihan
They feed in the coulees, they water in the draw
Their tails are all matted, their backs are all raw
Ride around little dogies, ride around them slow
For the fiery and snuffy are rarin' to go
Old Bill Jones had a daughter and a son
One went to college, the other went wrong
His wife, she got killed in a poolroom fight
But still he's a
Ride around little dogies, ride around them slow
For the fiery and snuffy are rarin' to go
When I die, take my saddle from the wall
Place it on my old pony, lead him out of his stall
Tie my bones to my saddle and turn our faces to the West
And we'll ride the prairie we love the best
Ride around little dogies, ride around them slow
For the fiery and snuffy are rarin' to go
I ride an old paint, I lead an old dan
I'm goin' to Montana to throw the hoolihan
They feed in the coulees, they water in the draw
Their tails are all matted, and their backs are all raw
Ride around little dogies, ride around them slow
For the fiery and snuffy are rarin' to go


"Hardin Wouldn't Run"
I know a man whose plow handle hand is quicker than a light
Wes Hardin is his name they say he travels in the night
For he might have to kill or walk around a fight
And if you ever saw Wes Hardin draw you know he can skin his gun
He won't say how many tried and died
Up against the top hand up against the wrong man cause Hardin' wouldn't run
He rode in like a Texas wind took the eastbound train
Goin' goin' with Jane Bowen till the law men caught up
So long Janie chin up I'll be back again
Off he went to Huntsville Prison so long Janie he cried
Fifteen years she waited till her heart broke and she died
And she left that bad land to wait up in the sky
Free at last the payin' past for all the wrong he did
First free air they let him breathe since he was a kid
So let him come and let him go and let him deal and bid
Near the border in El Paso Lawyer reads the sign
You won't find him there for business every day at nine
For business is real bad one client's all he's had in quite a long long time
Then sheriff Selman's boy broke in to Wes's woman's place
Up she jumped and pistol whipped him kicked him in the face
And John Selman demands revenge for this disgrace
You could see every night by candlelight in Hardin's favorite bar
She'd be hanging on his arm and very late they'd leave there
Headed for the Goose Hair glad it wasn't far
Right through the swinging doors John Selman came with a blazin' gun
Wes Hardin chug
John Wesley Hardin fell dead cos Hardin wouldn't run


"Mr. Garfield"
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Me and my brother was down close to the depot when I heard the report of a pistol
My brother run out and come back in all excited
And I said what was it and he said it was the report of a pistol and then he said
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Lord I knew the President was supposed to be at the depot that day
And we just would't believe that he's shot
But we'd run over there and there was so many folks around
That we couldn't see him but some lady was standin' there cryin'
And I said m'am what was it that happened m'am and she said
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Well everybody drifted off toward home finally
And they looked like they felt about as bad as I did
But in a few weeks I heard that the President was still alive
And I told my brother I said let's get on that train and go to where he's laid up hurt
Well when we got to his big house up there I asked the fellow
I said who was it that did it who was it that shoot the President
And he said it was Charlie Guiteau that shoot Mr. Garfield and I said
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man good man
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man low
I heard some fellow there that had been in the house to see the President
And I sidled up him to listen to what he was tellin' and he said
Mrs Lucretia Garfield was always at his side
In the heat of the day fannin' him when he was hot
He said that just that day the President said to Mrs Lucretia
He said Crete honey (he called her Crete)
Said if somethin' worse happens to me after awhile you get yourself a good man
And Mrs Lucretia said James (she called him James)
She said I won't hear to that now she said I love you too much but he said
You'll make some good man a good wife good wife
You'll make some man a good good good wife
(Don't pull in single harness all your life good gal
Don't pull in single harness all your life)
That's what he said don't pull in single harness all your life
Well a few days later I come back to where the President was restin'
And it seems everybody was cryin'
The flag was hangin' halfway up to the flagpole in front of the house
And everybody looked so sad and I asked a soldier boy there
And I said is is is Mr. Garfield and he said yeah he's gone
Gonna lay him in that cold lonesome ground down low
Gonna lay him in that cold lonesome ground
Well they laid the President by that long cold branch Mr. Garfield's been laid down low
Mr. Garfield has been shot dow Mr. Garfield's been shot
(Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low)


"Streets Of Laredo"
As I walked out on the streets of Laredo
As I walked out on Laredo one day
I spied a poor cowboy wrapped in white linen
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay
I can see by your outfit that you are a cowboy
These words he did say as I boldly walked by
Come an' sit down beside me an' hear my sad story
I'm shot in the breast an' I know I must die
It was once in the saddle, I used to go dashing
Once in the saddle, I used to go gay
First to the card
But I'm shot in the breast and I'm dying today
Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin
Six dance
Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin
Roses to deaden the clods as they fall
Then beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly
Play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the green valley, lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong
Then go write a letter to my grey
An' tell her the cowboy that she loved has gone
But please not one word of the man who had killed me
Don't mention his name and his name will pass on
When thus he had spoken, the hot sun was setting
The streets of Laredo grew cold as the clay
We took the young cowboy down to the green valley
And there stands his marker, we made, to this day
We beat the drum slowly and played the Fife lowly
Played the dead march as we carried him along
Down in the green valley, laid the sod o'er him
He was a young cowboy and he said he'd done wrong

"Johnny Reb"
You fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb
Saw you a marchin' with Robert E Lee
You held your head high tryin' to win the victory
You fought for your folks but you didn't die in vain
Even though you lost they speak highly of your name
Cause you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb
I heard your teeth chatter from the cold outside
Saw the bullets open up the wounds in your side
I saw the young boys as they began to fall
You had tears in your eyes cause you couldn't help at all
But you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb
I saw General Lee raise a sabre in his hand
Heard the cannons roar as you made your last stand
You marched into battle with the Grey and the Red
When the cannon smoke cleared it took days to count the dead
Cause you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb
When Honest Abe heard the news about your fall
The folks thought he'd call a great victory ball
But he asked the band to play the song Dixie
For you Johnny Reb and all that you believed
Cause you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb
(Yeah) You fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb
You foughtall the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
(Yeah) You fought all the way Johnny Reb


"A Letter From Home"
A cowpoke rode in one hot dusty day to a store down in old San Antone
He stood at the window and I heard him say do I have a letter from home
The postmaster looked through the mail that had come
Then smilingly shook his grey head
The cowboke looked sadly a moment at him and these are the words that he said
No letter from home no letter from home there's never a letter from home
(No message from mother and none from the other) there's never a letter from home
That night he was shot on the wrong side of town no more of those plains will he roam
I reached for my Bible and gave it to him and said son here's your letter from home
If only I had just a little more time to read it the young cowpoke said
I can't take it with me and I must go on then he died with his letter unread
The letter from home the letter from home no time for the letter from home
(The cowboy laid dead with his letter unread) too late for the letter from home


"Bury Me Not On The Lone Prairie"
Lord, I've never lived where churches grow I loved creation better
As it stood That day you finished it so long ago And looked upon your work and
Called it good I know that others find you in the light That sifted down through
Tinted window panes And yet I seem to feel you near tonight In this dim, quiet
Starlight on the plains I thank you, Lord, that I'm placed so well That you've
Made my freedom so complete That I'm no slave to whistle, clock or bell Nor weak
Eyed prisoner of Waller Street Just let me live my life as I've begun And give
Me work that's open to the sky Make me a partner of the wind and sun And I won't
Ask a life that's soft or high Let me be easy on the man that's down Let me be
Square and generous with all I'm careless sometimes, Lord, when I'm in town But
Never let them say I'm mean or small Make me as big and open as the plains And
Honest as the horse between my knees Clean as a wind that blows behind the rains
Free as the hawk that circles down the breeze Forgive me, Lord, if sometimes I
Forget You know about the reasons that are hid You understand the things that
Gall or fret Well, you knew me better than my mother did Just keep an eye on all
That's done or said And right me
Sometimes when I turn aside
And guide me on that long, dim trail ahead
That stretched upward toward the great divide
Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie
These words came low and mournfully
From the pallid lips of a youth who lay
On his dying bed at the close of day
Oh, bury me not and his voice failed there
But we took no heed to his dying prayer
In a shallow grave just six by three
We buried him there on the lone Prairie


"Mean As Hell"
The devil in hell we're told was chained a thousand years he there remained
He neither complain nor did he groan but was determined to start a hell of his own
Where he could torment the souls of men without being chained in a prison pen
So he asked the Lord if he had on hand anything left when he made this land
The Lord said yes there's a plenty of hand but if I left it down by the Rio Grande
The fact is ol' boy the stuff is so poor
I don't think you could use it as the hell anymore
But the devil went down to look at the truck
And said if he took it as a gift he was stuck
For after lookin' that over carefully and well he said this place is too dry for hell
But in order to get it off his hand the Lord promised the devil to water the land
So trade was closed and deed was given and the Lord went back to his home in heaven
And the devil said now I got all what's needed to make it good hell and he succeeded
He began by putting thorns all over the trees
He mixed up the sand with millions of fleas
He scattered tarantulas along the road put thorns on cactus and horns on toad
Lengthened the horns of the Texas steer put an addition to the rabbits ear
Put a little devil in the bronco steed and poisoned the feet of the centipede
The rattlesnake bites you the scorpion stings
The mosquito delights you with his buzzing wings
The sunburst are there and so the ants
And if you sit down you'll need have soles on your pants
The wild boar rooms on a black chaparral it's a hell of a place that he has for hell
The heat in the summers are hundred and ten too hot for the devil too hot for men
The red pepper grows upon the banks of the brook
The Mexican use it in all that he cook
Just dine it with one of 'em and you're bound to shout
I've hell on the inside as well as it out
My hands are calloused July to July I use a Big Dipper to navigate by
Fight off the wolves to drink from my well so I have to be mean as hell
A sheep herder came and put up the fence
I saw him one day but I ain't seen him since
But if you're needin' mutton we've got mutton to sell
We're cowpunchers and we're mean as hell
Neither me nor my pony's got a pedigree but he takes me where I'm wantin' to be
I'll ride him to death and when he is fell I'll get me another one mean as hell
I shot me a calf and I cut off her head
Cause the boys in the bunkhouse are waitin' to be fed
They rise in chime with the five thirty bell
And the best one of any of 'em is mean as hell


"Sam Hall"
Well, my name it is Sam Hall, Sam Hall
Yes, my name it is Sam Hall
My name it is Sam Hall an' I hate you, one and all
An' I hate you, one and all

My name is Samuel, Samuel

An' I'll see you all in hell
Damn your eyes

"The Blizzard"
There's a blizzard comin' on and I'm wishin' I was home
For my pony's lame and he can't hardly stand
Lord my hands feel like their froze and there's a numb that's in my toes
But it's only seven miles to Maryanne
It's only seven miles to MaryAnne
You can bet we're on her mind for it's nearly suppertime
And I know that there's hot biscuits in the pan
Listen to that norther sigh if we don't get home we'll die
But it's only five more miles to Maryanne
It's only five more miles to MaryAnne
That wind's howlin' and it seems mighty like a women's scream
And we'd best be movin' faster, if we can
Dan, just think about that barn with that hay so soft and warm
It's only three more miles to Maryanne
It's only three more miles to MaryAnne
Come on Dan get up, you honory cuss or you'll be the death of us
I'm so weary but I'll help you, if I can
All right, Dan, perhaps it's best we'll just stop a while and rest
For it's still another mile to Maryanne
It's still another mile to MaryAnne
Late that night the storm was gone and they found him there at dawn
He'd made it but he couln't leave ol' Dan
Yes, they found him on the plains his hands frozen to the reigns
He was just a hundred yards from Maryanne
He was just a hundred yards from MaryAnne


"Sweet Betsy From Pike"
(Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei)
Oh, do you remember sweet Betsy from Pike
She crossed the big mountains with her lover Ike
With two yoke of oxen and a big yellow dog
And a tall Shanghai rooster and one spottled hog
Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei
They soon reached the desert where Betsy gave out
And down in the sand she lay rolling about
While Ike in great tears looked on in surprise
Saying Betsy get up you'll get sand in your eyes
Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei
Betsy got up in the great deal of pain
She said she'd go back to Pike County again
But I gave a sigh then he fondly embraced
And he traveled along with his arm round her waist
(How can sweet Betsy went out to the dance
And Ike poor a fellow he's down at his pance)
Betsy was dressed up in ribbons and rings
Said Iken you're an angel but where are your wings
Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei
Well, the miner said Betsy will you dance with me
She answere I will if you want make two free
I can't dance too hard do you want to know why
Because I'm so full of that strong out cooli
Ike and sweet Betsy got married of course
But Ike was so jealous he gotta divorce
And Betsy well satidfied said with a shout
Goodbye forever I'm glad you've backed out
Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei


"Green Grow The Lilacs"
Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew
Green grow the lilacs when winter is thru
Each time I see lilacs my heart breaks in two
Cause springtime is here and its here without you
As sure as the bluebirds that fly up above
Springtime is sad without someone to love
Yes springtime is sad and it troubles my mind
In a world full of women, not one girl is mine
Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew
Green grow the lilacs when winter is thru
Each time I see lilacs my heart breaks in two
Cause springtime is here and its here without you
They say that its best to forget what we had
Then it is to remember and always be said
But still I keep wondering each now and then
If ever Ill see you and kiss you again
Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew
Green grow the lilacs when winter is thru
Each time I see lilacs my heart breaks in two
Cause springtime is here and its here without you


"Stampede"
We made camp along Red River
Watched the cattle as they bedded down
Back at the wagons, right after supper
We spread our bedrolls on the ground
And me and Willie, we took the night guard
And the sage never smelled so sweet
The prairie moon, was blazin' silver
No chance tonight for a stampede
Way over yonder, off in the distance
Towards the mountains there in the west
Did I see lightnin', did I hear thunder
My mind is weary, I could use some rest
Then all at once, the wind shifts directions
The clouds roll in behind the tumbleweeds
These longhorn cattle, are gettin' restless
God help us all, if they stampede
Smell the rain, hear the thunder
The midnight sky, turns black as death
The lightnin' crashes, smell the sulphur
It's rank and strong, it's Satan's breath
The cattle rise up, and go to runnin'
I spur my pony on and take the lead
And across the herd, I can hear Willie yellin'
Hey Stampede
Dust clouds rise, as the rain falls
They mix together, turn the air to mud
I feel the longhorns brush against me
And I can feel the demons racin' through my blood
Then all at once, my pony stumbles
We hit the ground, I rise up to my knees
In a flash of light, I can see the cattle comin'
Lord I know I'm gonna die in this stampede
Then I awake, and I look around me
I'm in my bedroll and I'm layin' on the ground
Over there's the wagon, and there's the campfire
I was only dreamin', but what's that sound
Then I feel the earth tremble underneath me
As the midnight sky begins to bleed
And from the blackness I can hear Willie yellin'
Hey Stampede


"The Shifting Whispering Sands, Part II"
Listen to the angel's story of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
Yes they always whisper to me
Of the days of long ago
When the settler and the miner
Fought the crafty Navajo
How the cattle roamed the valley
Happy people worked the land
Now everything is covered
By The Shifting, Whispering Sands
A miner left his buck board
Went to work his claim that day
And the burrows broke their halters
When they thought he'd gone to stay
How they found that ancient miner
Lying dead upon the sands
And for months they could but wonder
Did he die by human hands
So they dug his grave and laid him
On his back and crossed his hands
And his secret still is covered
By the Shifting, Whispering Sands
And his secret is still hidden
By the Shifting, Whispering Sands
This is what they always whisper to me
Out on the quiet desert air
Of the people and the cattle
And that miner lying there
So if you want to learn the secret
Wander through this quiet land
And I'm sure you'll hear the story
Of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
And I'm sure you'll hear the story
Of the Shifting, Whispering Sands


"Reflections"
Never in this world before or nevermore hereafter
Could a land know such a people as the pioneer the cowboy
His clothes his conversation his unique brand of lingo
All his devil deeds of daring his hat his bandana the dirty boots and ragged chaps
But mainly that sixgun dangling so's his hand could get it quickly
But draw your own conclusions lean to your own understandings
Your beliefs and your convictions
Disprove any fact recorded in these sounds and songs and legends
But I ask you if you do be sure you've walked in many mocassins
Over many many pathways and that you have listened carefully
Really listened to the west wind and to everything it whispers
And then go back and listen listen to this once more to these legends and traditions
They're only one reflection of a tick of time of that time
Just ponder on the things that happened
As we gaze so very deeply in the time and place and persons
Seeing now and then the West as it really was
And to tell you of a little that we saw there
And looking backward through a century
There was the True West there was the Real True West
Not demanding an argument but rather hoping you looked with us
And saw it as we saw it
And heard that west wind screaming shouting almost speaking
Always whispering of these things we sang and spoke of
And you'll hear perhaps the things the we said in the stories
And the legends and traditions
Through the wind that breeze these tales of the ones who never made it
Yet fighting heat and mountains plains and valleys snow and hunger
They went westward westward westward


"Rodeo Hand"
He's a rodeo hand a dyin' breed driftin' like a tumble weed
Rollin' where the urge tells him to go
And all this cowboy really needs is a tank of gas and entry fees
To get him to the next big rodeo
Now most athletes take alfalfa pills and super B's
A cowboy don't need all that motern stuff
A cowboy's gotta be lean and mean he trains on caffine and nicotine
And them all night drives help to make him tough
He's underfed and under paid and too damn hungry to be afraid
Some where between the crazy and insane
Cowboys ain't afraid pf dyin' shoot he'd even ride a red eyed Lion
If you'd show him where to take the rein
Now the only coach a cowboy needs is a growlin' gut that says come on let's eat
So tonight cowboy you better make a winning ride
Bout the only thing that makes him go
Is that big gold buckle waitin' down the road
And a bad case of too much cowboy pride


"Everybody Loves A Nut"
Everybody loves a nut the whole world loves a weirdo
Brains are in a rut but everybody loves a nut
There was a hermit named Fred who kept the dead horse in his cave
And everyone said to Fred
Fred how come you keep a dead horse in your cave and he said well
(Everybody loves a nut the whole world loves a weirdo)
Brains are in a rut but everybody loves a nut
A columbia man named Frank had a tiger named Hank
He tried to put Hank in his tank guess what happened to ol' Frank
When they picked up the teets there and eyeballs
And erected a tombstone that read
(Everybody loves a nut...)
Another Columbia fella told queen Isabella
I don't think the world is flat and now what do you think about that
And she said you don't and he said no ma'm
And she said he'd get out of my queendom and he said yes ma'm
(Everybody loves a nut...)
Everybody loves a nut...)


"The One On The Right Is On The Left"
There once was a musical troupe
A pickin' singin' folk group
They sang the mountain ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They were long on musical ability
Folks thought they would go far
But political incompatibility led to their downfall
Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear was a Methodist
This musical aggregation toured the entire nation
Singing the traditional ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They performed with great virtuosity
And soon they were the rage
But political animosity prevailed upon the stage
Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear burned his driver's license
Well the curtain had ascended
A hush fell on the crowd
As thousands there were gathered to hear The folk songs of our land
But they took their politics seriously
And that night at the concert hall
As the audience watched deliriously
They had a free
Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy in the rear, said
Oh dear
Now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
Don't go mixin' politics with the folk songs of our land
Just work on harmony and diction
Play your banjo well
And if you have political convictions keep them to yourself
Now, the one on the left works in a bank
And the one in the middle drives a truck
The one on the right's an all
And the guy in the rear got drafted

"The Bug That Tried To Crawl Around The World"
Now you've heard of folks with a lot of ambition
But I believe just about the biggest case of ambition I ever saw
Was in a bug that I saw crawlin' along the beach one day
He was a mighty ambitious bug
On the beach one early mornin' as a day was newly dawnin'
And the sun again was warmin' all the chill thru'out the land
I saw me a bug a walkin' and at first I thought he was quakin'
Then I found out he was talkin' while he crawled across the sand
He was crawlin' mighty straight at a slow but a steady gait
And when I asked him to wait he said oh come on crawl with me
But I said where you goin' and he said you'll be knowin'
For I'm gonna make a showin' and you'll someday see
Well I stood there by the ocean I suddenly had the notion
That I start this big promotion so this challenge I enfirled said the bug
So I gave my wife a hug and I left my confy rug
So I could be the only bug that ever crawled around the world
Well he seemed mighty small and it was a long way to crawl
And I'm sure he couldn't swim at all so I try to discourage my friend
I said you know the world is round and there's mighty lotta ground
And there some water to be found before you reach your journey's end
And he said now don't you fret there's problems to be met
But I'll make it you can bet and this deed will bring glory to my name
You know they said man would never fly now he's soarin' in the sky
Cause he had the will to try so let me win my fame
So he crawled on out of sight as he sought that splendoured height
Neither lookin' left nor right but slowly marchin' toward his goal
And my knowin' he had started on his journey as we parted
Kept me from feelin' too down hearted for he was a mighty ambitious soul
Well I've looked everywhere I've been and seen a lotta bugs since then
But not one quite like my little friend when I think of him I'm filled with pride
Did he make it I don't know he was crawlin' mighty slow and he had a long way to go
And all I can tell you folks is that he tried he sure was an ambitious bug


"The Singing Star's Queen"
Twinkle twinkle little star who's the greatest star what are (Waylon)
Now Waylon is a singer a record sellin' star the ladies love him and his band
Oh he sings like a bird and he plays a fine guitar
But I doubt that he's a home lovin' man
You oughta see his woman she's really a queen he buys her the finest of clothes
For you talk about beauties like none you ain't seen
When Waylon's gone she lets me know
When he's gone a singing I'm gone with his queen spreadin' his money around
But if you'll look for me and I can't be seen you'll know that Waylon's back in town
When Waylon's gone a singing I'm wearin' his suit I smoke his imported cigars
I like his woman wear out his boots I chauffeur his limousine cars
When he's making money he has to stay gone but if you should hear that he's around
Go buy his latest record or go see his show help me keep ol' Waylon out of town
When Waylon's out singing I'm gone with his queen
Starkle starkle little twink Waylon's the greatest star I think
Bring him to your town join his fan club the journal you get the journal every year
A dollar is about all is costs don't you dare miss it come see Waylon


"Austin Prison"
They had a warrant out for me all over the country
And I was trying to beat the raps in Idaho
I was breaking into a schoolhouse Sunday morning without warning
When I saw the sheriff coming for me slow from down below
His steel grey eyes were blazing when he saw me
His hand was on his gun when he rode up
He said you killed that woman I know you shot her why'd you do it
I'm taking you to Austin then I'm gonna lock you up
Well he tied me with a plow line the next morning
And he had me deep in Texas the next day
A crazy screaming lynch mob waited in the streets of Austin
But he put me in the jailhouse and he threw the key away
A jury found me guilty three months later twelve evil men with murder in their eyes
They even took me out and said now show us where you killed her
And that wicked judge said now I here by sentence you to die
But here I am far away from Austin prison my friend the jailer handed me a file
Now all I want between me and there are a lot of friendly people
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles


"Dirty Old Egg"

If you don't stay out of my hen house
You dirty old egg
Now if he don't stop eatin' my eggs up
Though I'm not a real bad guy
I'm gonna get my riffle and send him
To that great chicken house in the sky
Egg
You're always hangin' around
But you'd better stay out of my hen house
You dirty old egg


"Take Me Home"
Well I've been from Boston to LA seen Boulder Dam and Frisco Bay
I seen New York City and Washington
Seen Montreal and Saskatchewan and Rhode Island
And I've worked in three all night service stations and I drove a truck
Take me home my heart is heavy and my feet are sore
Take me home I don't wanna roam no more
Well I slept all night in a water trough
Had the flu and the croup and the whoopin' cough
Had the mumps and the measles and the seven years itch
And I can't count the times that I've had a cold and a sore throat
Not to mention all the times that I cut my fingers on a sardine can
Take me home my heart is heavy
Well I can just see 'em all now just a gatherin' round
Mama's supper table when the sun goes down
And my good old pappy when the blessing is said
Fillin' up his plate with black eyed peas and all that stuff and side meat
And a great big hunk of my dear sweet mama's hot buttered cornbread
Take me home my heart is heavy
Take me home my heart is heavy


"Please Don't Play Red River Valley"
Well I see you got yourself a brand new harmonica
Mail ordered from the Steagal's catalogue
Boy I hope you can learn to play it like Lonnie Glossom
And while you added you to oughta learn a verse or two
Of Red River Valley Oh My Darling Clementine or Salty Dog
Oh but please don't play Red River Valley
And how about Polly Wolly doodle all day and see
You know the only song I ever learned to play on my 2 dollar and 98 cent harmonica
That I got from Wayne Raney in Clint Texas
T Clint Texas was Red River Valley
Then she said farewell to my french harp and me
Well I see you're doin' pretty good on your new harmonica
But don't you think you oughta learn about one more tune you know
See you hold it like you's gonna eat a handful of popcorn
And sometime you suck in and sometimes you blow
But friend now please don't play Red River Valley
And how about Polly Wolly doodle all day
Like I said the only song I ever learnd
On my 2 dollar and 98 cent harmonica that I got from Clint Texas
From Wayne Raney in Clint Texas was Red River Valley
Oh then she said farewell to my french harp and me


"Boa Constrictor"
I'm getting swallowed by a Boa Constrictor
By a Boa Constrictor by a Boa Constrictor
I'm getting swallowed by a Boa Constrictor and I don't like snakes one bit
What do you know he's swallowed my toe oh gee he's up to my knee

Nearly all in he's up to my chin oh dread he's swallowed my...excuse me


"Joe Bean"
Last time we were here at Folsom Prison
they were hanging Joe Bean
Is Joe still here...Joe Bean
Hang the son of a bitch anyways, right
Well, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning
for killing a man in Arkansas
Funny thing about it
Joe Bean has never been to Arkansas
On top of that, Joe Bean never heard of the man
In fact, today is Joe Bean's twentieth birthday
See through the prison bars
Joe Bean, see where the gallows stand
Just twenty short years from the day you were born
you died by the hangman's hand
Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning
for a shooting that he never did
He killed 20 men, by the time he was 10, he was an unruly kid
Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean for the one shooting that Joe Bean never did
Well, Joe
asking the governor for a stay
And it's hard on her
cause she knows where you were, on that particular day
You were working Joe Bean, hard working, robbing the Santa Fe
Well, the telegraph wires are humming
Here, the governor's words come through
He said
I can't set you free, it's not up to me, but there's much, Joe Bean, I'll do
I'll join your mother in extending Birthday greetings to you
Happy Birthday, Joe Bean


"Happiness Is You"
Way down the mountain I chased a moonbeam
On the beach I built sand castles too
My moonbeams faded my castles tumbled
All of this was meaningless cause happiness is you
No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars
I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are
My heart won't miss you my heart goes with you
Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you
I tried to doubt you and live without you
Tried to deny but I love you like a do
But I realize now and I'll admit it
You'll always be a part of me cause happiness is you
No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars
I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are
My heart won't miss you my heart goes with you
Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you


"Guess Things Happen That Way"
Well you ask me if I'll forget my baby
I guess I will, someday
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll get along
I guess I will, someway
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
God gave me that girl to lean on
then he put me on my own
Heaven help me be a man
and have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll miss her kisses
I guess I will, everyday
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll find another
I don't know. I can't say
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
God gave me that girl to lean on
then he put me on my own
Heaven help me be a man
and have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way


"Ancient History"
Just walk on out the door it's all over
Forgiving you is just a waste of time
I don't believe that I'll live to regret it
Cause you're ancient hist'ry to this heart of mine
So many times I've heard the same old story
Any fool can learn to read between the lines
And this time honey you've burned all your bridges
You're ancient hist'ry to this heart of mine
I've marked you down as just another lonely page
In the book of heartaches that you'll leave behind
Cause I've found out I'm better off without you
You're ancient hist'ry to this heart of mine
I've marked you down as just another lonely page
In the book of heartaches that you'll leave behind
Cause I've found out I'm better off without you
You're ancient hist'ry to this heart of mine


"You Comb Her Hair"
I know that you're wondering who I dream about
And if I've met someone who thrills me so
Well I finally met a girl who turns me inside out
I'll tell you about her for you ought to know
You comb her hair every morning and make sure she dresses just right
You comb her hair every morning and put her to bed every night
When she's around me sometimes I can hardly speak
I stammer and I act just like a fool
And just to hold her hand in mine makes me feel weak
You know her honey don't you know it's you
You comb her hair every morning and make sure she dresses just right
You comb her hair every morning and put her to bed every night


"She Came From The Mountains"
She came from the mountains Rocky Mountains eagle
She's from where the mountains lean up to the sky
Now she's back among the Rockies where mountain thunders cry
Now the wind from off the mountains wails a sad goodbye
Once in Colorado Springs at the foot of old Pike's Peak
I met a Rocky Mountain girl to my soul her heart let speak
We went to tell her parents and an old grandmother said
If you'll leave these mountains girl you'll wish that you were dead
The next day I took her with me to my far
Way out on the flatlands where the mountain winds don't moan
Each footstep we took was happy or at least it shoudn't been
But I would find her listening for that same lone mountain wind
She came from the mountains
Months passed as fast as antelopes until one fatal dismal dawn
I walked to see morning sun shine down on where she was gone
I'd known that lately she'd been sad women sometimes get that way
I hadn't guessed how much was wrong until that fatal day
She had left the weeping letter homesick with mountain names
She was somewhere in the Rockies and I knew I'd been to blame
So now in Colorado Springs I wait near old Pike's Peak
Where once I met a mountain girl that mountain girl I seek
She came from the mountains


"For Lovin' Me"
That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
Everything you have is gone that you can see
That's what you get for lovin' me
I ain't the kind to hang around
With any new love that I found
Movin' is my stock and trade
I'm movin' on
I won't think of you when I'm gone
So don't you shed a tear for me
I ain't the love you thought I'd be
I've got a hundred more like you
So don't be blue
I'll have a thousand 'fore I'm through
Now there you go you're cryin' again
Now there you go you're cryin' again
But then someday your poor heart is on the mend
I just might pass your way again
That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
Everything you have is gone that you can see
That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me


"No One Will Ever Know"
No one will ever know my heart is breaking
Although a million teardorps start to flow
I'll cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling
I'll love you but no one will ever know
I'll tell them we grew tired of each other
And that I was glad the day you set me free
I'll even make believe I never loved you
And no one will ever know the truth but me
I'll tell them we grew tired of each other
And that I was glad the day you set me free
I'll even make believe I never loved you
And no one will ever know the truth but me


"Is This My Destiny"
Cursed with sorrow pain and woe full of feeling I can't show
Hopeless love what else for me is this my destiny
At night I toss and wonder why I must live while others die
The grave would be escape for me from this my destiny
I know God surely made for every man somewhere a maid
Someone stole my love from me is this my destiny
At night I toss and wonder why


"A Wound Time Can't Erase"
Have you found since you turned me down
The one that you were searching for
Are you glad that you made me sad
For you know I vowed to love you ever more
What did you have in mind when you broke this heart of mine
Are you laughing in my face
Darling what can I do when you say we're through
You've left a wound time can't erase
Tell me now are you satisfied
To be foot loose and fancy free
Is it power you want for the things that you've done
What you've gained I guess I'll never see
What did you have in mind when you broke this heart of mine
Are you laughing in my face
Darling what can I do when you say we're through
You've left a wound time can't erase


"Happy To Be With You"
Happy to be with you happy to be with you
Happy to be with you bound to follow you
Somewhere someone above sents you to me for me to love
Hearts can tremble and shake hearts can shutter and break
I give more than I take cause I'm happy to be with you
Happy to be with you happy to be with you
Good times outweigh the bad count the good ones we've had
We have our ups and downs but the good times come around
Nickels and pennies are few don't have a fortune for you
Love you yes I do and I'm happy to be with you
Happy to be with you happy to be with you


"Wabash Cannonball"
From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
She climbs a flowery mountains o'er the hills and by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome she's known quite well by all
She's a regular combination on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball
Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
She's from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball
Here's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And always be remembered in the courts throughout the land
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
We'll carry him home to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

And if you live on such solid ground
Whatcha doin' down in Shantytown

"It Ain't Me Babe"
Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe
Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only let you down
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes to you
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe
You say you're lookin' for someone
To pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
And will love you for your life
And nothin' more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe

"Fast Boat To Sydney"
Oh I am a cheat and I'm a liar
Oh but you're a lovin' ball of fire
I'll leave you like a bum without a penny
And while I'm home with the blues
I'll be hopin' like a kangaroo
When I get off of that fast boat to Sydney
I said listen to me babe
I gave up the lovin' trade
I'm tired of all this runnin' jumpin' playin'
But you're like it down under
The world with the Australian girls
And there's not a word of truth in what you're sayin'
Oh I am a cheat and I'm a liar
Oh but you're a lovin' ball of fire
I'll leave you like a bum without a penny
And while I'm home with the blues
I'll be hopin' like a kangaroo
When I get off of that fast boat to Sydney
This is my greatest act
I've come boom a rangin' back
Grinnin' like a Rudolf Valentino
But then you grab your travel load
Like a swingin' grimmin' dog
And hopped on that fast boat to Sydney
Cause I am a cheat and I'm a liar
Oh but you're a lovin' ball of fire
I'll leave you like a bum without a penny
And while I'm home with the blues
I'll be hopin' like a kangaroo
When I get off of that fast boat to Sydney


"Pack Up Your Sorrows"
Oh but if somehow you could pack up your sorrows and give them all to me
You would lose them I know how to use them give them all to me

Cause there's too many bad times too many sad times
And nobody knows what you mean
Oh but if somehow you could pack up your sorrows and give them all to me
You would lose them I know how to use them give them all to me
No use rambling walkin' in the shadows trailin' a wandering star
No one beside you no one to guide you and nobody knows where you are
Oh but if somehow you could pack up your sorrows and give them all to me
You would lose them I know how to use them give them all to me
No use roaming walking by that roadside seeking a satisfied mind
There's too many highways too many byways and nobody walking behind

You would lose them I know how to use them give them all to me
You would lose them I know how to use them give them all to me

"Oh, What A Good Thing We Had"
Sunshine and showers and everything comin' up daisies
Oh what a good thing we had gone bad oh what a good thing we had
Driveins and picnics end every day was Saturday
Oh what a good thing we had gone bad oh what a good thing we had
The whole wide world was jealous we wouldn't hear a thing they'd tell us
Never did need any money everything was milk and honey
Oh long walks by the river talkin' bout living together
Oh what a good thing we had gone bad oh what a good thing we had
Long weeks of waitin' and livin' for the day we marry
Oh what a good thing we had gone bad oh what a good thing we had

You feel sad sad but boy it ain't that bad
You cry just a little bit and die just a little bit
And then you'll be all right
Well you know it wasn't long ago
Your honey bee was queen of my bee tree
But then away she flew and took my honey to you
You cry just a little bit and die just a little bit
And then you'll be all right

You watched your queen bee fly
Your honeycomb went dry
But if you keep pushin' on
You won't care if she's gone
You cry just a little bit and die just a little bit
And then you'll be all right
You cry just a little bit and die just a little bit
And then you'll be all right

"The Wind Changes"
It's not that I don't love you anymore
It's not that I don't want to
It's just that there's a line I have to darw
You've gotta cross it, don't you
It would take so little
You know I long to stay
Not until the wind changes
Not until my heart erases
Ever single memory of you
It's not that you can't hurt me anymore
It's not that you don't want to
It's just that there's a door I have to close
You've gotta lock it, dont you
There is darkness in our lives
We can't see the light
Not until the wind changes
Not until my heart erases
Ever single memory of you
I don't want to lose what we never had
I don't want the dream of living in the past
If you've gotta leave I don't want to know
I never saw you coming I don't want to watch you go
Not until the wind changes
Not until my heart erases
Ever single memory of you
Might as we be history
Every single memory of you
Not until the wind changes
Ooh
Every single memory of you
Not until the wind changes


"From Sea To Shining Sea"
The beautiful spacious skies, the amber waves of grain
To the majestic purple mountains above the fruited plain
God did shed His grace from sea to shining sea on you and on me
From Sleepy Hollow mountain country to the swamps of Okefenokee
To Guthrie Oklahoma, to Hibbing Minnesota
To Grants Pass Oregon, to Stone Pipe Wells, California
From Texas to Montana, from California to Maine
In the sunny days the winter snow from Arizona sand
To Cherokee North Carolina, to Tarpen Springs Florida
America, it's time to be refreshed, recalled to memory
God did shed His grace on Thee from sea to shining sea
The land is big the best is free
Sand and surf grass and tree from sea to shining sea
God shed His grace on me
And crown Thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea

"The Whirl And The Suck"
It took a mighty good man with salty hands
And a mighty long raft to keep the fore before the act
You take ten good men and guts and luck
And you might navigate the whirl and the suck
Well the Tennessee River changed its mind at Chattanooga she oughta unwind
She could a run right on the Georgia Sea but she cut right back through Tennessee
Well the settlers come by raft and boat bringin' everything that could stay a float
But like a loco horse that'll twist and buck
They hardly ever made it through the whirl and the suck
It took a mighty good man
When General Washington was in his knicker bocks
The Cherokee Indians through the Chattanooga Rocks
And the Chickamagua tribe and the Nickajack
They kept the watch where the river cut back
And if a raft or a boat ever rode the bend
The Indians got 'em cause they had 'em hemmed in
It took a mighty good man


"Call Daddy From The Mines"
A little girl woke up deep in the dark and started cryin'
The mother brought a light and held her daughter tight
She thought it was so strange to hear a little girl of nine
Cry call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine
Her mother wiped the tears and said see honey you're only dreaming
Your dad must work today he has to draw his pay
She left her then but still could hear her cry time after time
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine
Then the countryside was shaken by a mighty rumble
And fear for miles around was the trembling of the ground
The little girl was fast asleep yet cried out one more time
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine
Ten thousand tears and two weeks later deep in the smoking ground
A dying man was found had survived all those around
He'd quickly crawled to a fresh air pocket barely just in time
When he heard his own child whine call daddy from the mine
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine


"The Frozen Four Hundred Pound Fair To Middlin' Cotton Picker"
I left the field one evening my fingers so cold and sore
From fair to middlin' cotton 300 pounds or more
Jim McCann was still pickin' straddle in the row
The sun began to sinkin' and the wind began to blow
He was bound to get 400 a draggin' a twelve foot sack
I hollered out Jim come weight it but I only saw his back
So I went on home to supper and I gathered around my kin
I was thinkin' of Jim out there pickin' with winter settin' in
Next morning the air was freezin' the snow was nine feet deep
I jerked on my long red handles and I left my kids asleep
I got myself a shovel and went to where I seen Jim go
And commenced to a diggin' for him at the other end of his row
I found his body frozen and I took him in to thaw
I dragged in his sack and I weighed it and I added Jim's marks that I saw
The total was over 400 so he'd picked more than he'd bet
Of fair to middlin' cotton but Jim ain't thawed out yet


"Cisco Clifton's Filling Station"
It's not always the land that's the hardest and bitterest
It's the man who has the hard bitter attitude
Toward his fellow man or toward the land
Such is the case that you will find in this following song
About a man's attitude toward his fellow man and toward this land
I walked in the big yard to feel the warm sunshine
A ninety
He offered a smoke and he said as I rolled it
Tomorrow I'm going to break out and go free
They watch us by sunlight they watch us by spotlight
But I know a way for a man to go free
Down under my cell I'm diggin' a tunnel
The walls of a prison will never hold me
I told him that I'd have no part of his scheming
My time would be over one year from today
His eyes blazed with fire and he looked right through me
Bitter but broken again he did say
They watch us by sunlight
Next morning at breakfast the old man was missing
Then we all heard the rifles high up on the wall
He'd gone through the tunnel just like he had promised
And they said he was crying when they saw him fall
They watch us by sunlight


"The Masterpiece"
There was an old stone
And the old stone
And all around his cabin were statues the man had made
Statues that the buyers said were all of a mediocre grade
With his calloused hands he lit a lamp and laid down his head on his handmade table
And he softly whispered Lord I'm old and shaky and I'm hardly able
But give me strenght and wisdom and give me a week at least
And I'll climb up to the top of this mountain and chisel out a masterpiece
The very next morning he felt new strenght
And he took his brand new hammer and the sharpest chisel
He began to climb the mountain his old feet slipping in the freezing dizzle
When he finally reached the top he shouted to a world that didn't hear
I'll carve my masterpiece out of this marble boulder here
So the hammer beat the chisel and he hammered till an image grew
Then he stopped to look it over to appraise his work when he was through
It was a boy carrying a crippled boy and the old man said it isn't my masterpiece
I'll call it charity and then a masterpiece of mine will be
So the hammer beat the chisel til another immage in a marbel grew
Then the wind began to blowing and he sat and rested when he was through
It was the image of a mother holding her child
He said this is love as the world would know
But it isn't my masterpiece and he began again as it began to snow
The hammer beat the chisel as the snow fell harder and the wind grew and grew
He fell to his knees holding a stone and he threw down his hammer and his chisel too
He lay frozen face down in the snow but one hand was held for the world to see
Cut in the marble was his masterpice three neatly carved letters GOD


"You And Tennessee"
Like a sweet rippling mountain stream
Goes the sound of the banjo on Cripple Creek
Never beginning never ending just rippling on and on
So does the land just ripple on and on
As a heart gets soft on a woman so can the heart get soft on the land
And to fall in love with a woman as well as the land is to surely be in love
I stayed away too long I know and every day was slow to go
Every night I dreamed I was here it's been a mighty lonely year
Every mile I needed you I kinda hope that you needed me too
Everywhere I saw your face around every town I was in
This old familiar place welcomed me again
Back to where I belonged to be back to you and Tennessee
Back to you and Tennessee
Beside the Cumberland River where the grass is soft and sweet
We ran across the fields of cedar hiding from the noisy streets
And when the leaves fell from the cold the stars were silver the moon was gold
I said it's yours with love from me
I'm planting my roots in this ground and when they look for me I'll be found
With something that is part of me you and Tennessee
Back with you and Tennessee


"Another Song To Sing"
Do they ask you where I am or where I've been
Do they ever say where is the lonely friend
Is my name whispered in your bedside prayers
Do you feel a vacant spot beside you there
Well there's always one more path that I must walk
And there's people I should sit down with and talk
And somebody might appreciate the flowers I could bring
So there's always another song to sing
Do you tell them I was wilder than the wind
Do you remember that I needed lots of friends
And at other times I'd rather be alon
Where I could not be found when I was gone
Well there's always one more canyon to explore
To touch the things left by those gone before
At the top of the tiniest hill I can feel like I'm a king
And there's always another song to sing


"The Flint Arrowhead"
While traveling this land from border to border and from sea to sea
There have a few occasions to leave the beaten path and to find the place
And quiet that's good for thought and just walking through a trackless forest
Or exploring ruins of the earliest settlers or walking along a creekbed
Hoping to find a relic such as a tomahawk an axe
Or even an arrowhead left by a race of long since vanished Indians
There's a great thrill and it's a wonderful feeling to find a flint arrowhead
Over fields of new turned sod and in communion with my God I walked alone
In a furrow bed I found an arrowhead chiseled from stone
I don't know how long ago some redman drew his bow on its last fight
Or did he drop it here afraid white men were near to attack at night
I do know this one thing beyond all questioning it was made to kill
And proof of a master trade is in this arrowhead he made fashioned with skill
That I inherited this ground is denied by this stone I've found but when and by who
Come join me in my tracks then let's stop and look back to the vale and through
In love and peace we'll see the shadows and the trees and voices too
But quietly slowly tread this home of the forgotten dead whose bones are dust
I'm proud that their craftsmen's skill survives the ages still left in my trust


"Shrimpin' Sailin"
Turn on the speak it's the first time I get
To talk on the speak 'cause you know okay
Darn those smart alec, crazy cajon boy
Come in to my nice clean kitchens
And get into my pantry, get my blackberry jim jam
That I'd pick blackberries
And make a jim jam in the winter time
To take out on the shrimpin' boat
And bring in a foldin' wads
Of wondrous waddy for my little wienies
And they come in to my blackberry jim jam
In the pantry and get them all over
The nice clean kitchen table cloth
The smart alec cajon boy will play the music
Well, the Gulf it got a grassy bottom settin' where the rock is there
And that's where I've been goin' for the shrimpin' sailin'
Leapin' 'cross the grassy moss bringing in a briny bin
Makin' folds of wondrous waddy for the living that I'm lovin'
Where they creep and crawl and flip and flap and flob and dangle dobbin'
Sponge a fouler drag 'em holler more a course the ocean horse
Well, the Gulf it got a grassy bottom settin' where the rock is there
And that's where I've been goin' for the shrimpin' sailin'
Till it's time to haul 'em and come back in with the briny bin
Of soddy bodies dressed in dandy eatin' carmel candy
Makin' me and all by babies foldin' wads of wondrous waddy
For the livin' that I'm lovin' in between the shrimpin' sailin'
Gulf, it got a grassy bottom settin' where the rock is there
Leapin' 'cross the grassy moss bringing in a briny bin
Makin' folds of wondrous waddy for the living that I'm lovin'
Where they creep and crawl and flip and flap and flob and dangle dobbin'
Sponge a fouler drag 'em holler more a course the ocean horse
Till it's time to haul 'em come back in with the briny bin
Of soddy bodies dressed in dandy carmel candy eatin' chicken
Finger lickin', dancin', rancin', mancin', tancin'
Makin' me and all by babies foldin' wads of wondrous waddy


"The Walls Of A Prison"
There's alot of strange men in cellblock ten
But the strangest of em' all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Starin at the wall
Starin at the wall
In his hand was a note that his gal had wrote
Proving crime don't pay
Was the very same gal he robbed and stole for
Wanting thier wedding day
Wanting thier wedding day
As he looked at the wall
So strong and tall
I heard him softely curse
Nobody at all ever climed that wall
But I'm gonna be the first
I'm gonna be the first
Then the warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
Cause there is no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall
If you ever touch that wall
Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall
He never made that wall
Well there's never been a man who shook this camp
But I knew a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
But I know it was sucide
I know it was sucide


"Prologue"
We are in the Holy Land
The ground upon which I stand is sacred to the Jew the Christian Moslem Islam
To millions of people the world over and has been throughout the ages
This is the promised land
The land that God showed to Moses from a top Mount Nebo
Which we can see in the distance
At this place in Galilee the sound of God's voice has been heard
As He spoke to the prophets
Once man heard God's voice when He said of his son Jesus Christ
This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased
Such a blessing to be able to hear the voice of God has been given to very few
But such a blessing was given to the Land of Israel


"Land Of Israel"
From the top of Sinai
to the Sea of Galilee
Every hill and plain is home
Every place is dear to me
There the breezes tell the stories
Oh, what stories they do tell
Of the mighty things that happened
In the Land of Israel
Here, where Moses and the prophets
Spoke of One who would be king
Of a Heavenly Messiah
And the blessings He would bring
Oh, to hear the call again
All is peaceful, all is well
Upon every rock and mountain
In the land of Israel


"Mother's Love"
We are in Nazareth within a few feet of this place Jesus lived as a child
With his father Joseph the carpenter and his mother Mary
In Jerusalem the mother of Jesus watched her son die on the cross
She stood by to give him the only thing that she had left a mother's love
It was my mother who first told me of Israel stories of this land
That made it so dear to me that I am draw like a prodigal son to relive these stories
Here's a two thousand year old story that tells of the strength of a mother's love
Once a young man lived with his mother beside a great forest
The young man was in love with a beautiful girl who lived in the forest
He told the girl in the forest that if she would marry him
He would bring her anything that she asked
Knowing that the young man lived with his mother the girl said
Take your dagger and cut out your mother's heart
And bring it to me and I will marry you
Well this made the young man very sad
But he wanted to merry the girl so he killed his mother and cut out her heart
Running through the forest with his mother's heart in his hands
He stumbled and fell and dropped the heart
As he was getting up his mother's heart cried out from the ground
My son did you hurt yourself when you fell


"This Is Nazareth"
The noises you hear in the background are the different little shops
Here in the market place in Nazareth
There's a man beating out some pans with a hammer there
You know looking at Nazareth especially in this part of Nazareth
You'd be inclined to feel like Nathaniel did when he said to Phillip in the Bible
Can there be any good thing ever come from Nazareth
And John the Babtist preaching repentance down on the Jordan River
Which we'll be seeing later on today
Said there's one coming after me the latchet of whose shoes
I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose
And the prophets had said referring to this place right here
He shall be called a Nazarene


"Nazarene"
Caesar ruled Rome and all its glory
Every land called Alexander Great
But no man can compare in any story
With the one man who controls so many's fate
Yes along the dusty road came the Nazarene
Baptized by John was the Nazarene
Preaching on the top of the mountain was the Nazarene
Followed by the multitude was the Nazarene
Tried and condemned they laid their stripes on Him
But like He said back from the dead came the Nazarene
Nothing good had ever come from Nazareth
An unimportant place in Galilee
But the soul of any man could fall into bondage
And God had promised man could be set free
And then along the dusty road came the Nazarene
Baptized by John was the Nazarene
Preaching on the top of the mountain was the Nazarene
Followed by the multitude was the Nazarene
Tried and condemned they laid their stripes on Him
But like He said back from the dead came the Nazarene


"Town Of Cana"
We are in the Town of Cana
It is a short distance from Nazareth toward the Sea of Galilee
And on his way to Capernaum Jesus stopped at a wedding feast
Here which he was invited to
And when he came to the feast he was told that the family was so poor
That they didn't have wine for the wedding feast
So Christ at this very spot that we are entering right now
On which a church stands over
Jesus ordered the jugs filled with water
And then when they were served at the feast
When the jugs were poured around to the different people
It was wine of the finest wine that was known in Galilee at that time
We are entering now down into a kind of a crypt
Where the miracle actually took place
And there is one of the jugs here
That supposedly was one of those he used to pour the wine from that had been water
And the well that the water was drawn from
We are at the place where the water cintern was
It is all undeground as most people lived back then under ground because it was cool
This is where the water came from
He turned the water into wine


"He Turned Water Into Wine"
He turned the water into wine he turned the water into wine
In the little Cana town the word went all around that he turned the water into wine
Well he walked upon the Sea of Galilee he walked upon the Sea of Galilee
Shouted far and wide he calmed the raging tide and walked upon the Sea of Galilee
He turned the water into wine
He healed the leper and the lame he healed the leper and the lame
He said go and tell no man but they shouted it through the land
That he healed the leper and the lame
He turned the water into wine
He fed the hungry multitude yes he fed the hungry multitude
With a little bit of fish and bread they said everyone was fed
He fed the hungry multitude
He turned the water into wine


"My Wife June At The Sea Of Galilee"
This is the 23rd of April no May, 23rd of May and John and I are
sitting on the veranda of a hotel that is in Tiberias Israel
It is right on the Sea of Galilee
We can see to our left the place where they held the Sermon On The Mount
And across the lake is now the land of Israel
But up until eleven months ago was held by Syria
On down to the right further down the Jordan River joins the Sea if Galilee
And it's a beautiful day with the birds
You can hear the motor boats on the lake only one that I can see
And then a big pleasure boat that is coming across the other side
from the Sea of Galilee
The lake at this point I'd say is about eight miles wide and it's fourteen miles long
Hmm that's right June Israel is really again in its glory
This is a beautiful place
It's in much greater glory that she was in the days of King Herod
I'm proud to say for the Jews today King Herod gained the throne like a fox
Ruled like a lion and died like a dog


"Beautiful Words"
We're at the place of the Sermon on the mount
Beautiful words beautiful words He spoke beautiful words
The wind lay still and the whole world listened as He spoke beautiful words
Blessed are the poor in spirit for their is the Kingdom of Heaven
Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled
Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy
Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the Children of God
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake
For their is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile ye
And persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for My sake
Beautiful words beautiful words He spoke beautiful words
The wind lay still and the whole world listened as He spoke beautiful words


"Our Guide Jacob At Mount Tabor"
We are now up on top of Mount Tabor
And Jacob you're our guide so how about telling us in your own words
Just what happened at this place
I hope the wind is not making too much noise we are at a great height up here
(Here we are this is Mount Tabor
We are standing on the highest of the lower Galilee mountains watching around us
A most magnificent view really one can except to see
This of course is the Mountain of Trans
Where Christ with his three elder disciples climbed up the mountain
And that is when at the same time they all spoke saying
Master Master can we have three tents made here
The place is so beautiful we want to stay
And at that same moment they saw Christ was conversing
With Moses and Delijah the prophet
A cloud came from which the voice of the Lord was heard saying
This is my son my chosen son Thou shalt obey
They watched to the face of Christ at that time
And saw that there was light around it
He was transfigured His tunic became as white as snow
So it's called the Mountain of Trans
This is where it happened)
Thank you very much Jacob and you know there was another time that Moses
That you were talking about Moses climbed the mountain


"The Ten Commandments"
Moses led God's children out to find the promised land
And on the way he'd stop each day and look to Heaven and
Asked God for help as he could not withstand the task alone
And then one day he looked away and thereby lay a stone
God said write upon this stone these words I say to you
And if you all obey my rules I'll see you safely through
God opened Heaven's door and then He guided Moses' hands
And then He said go and tell my children these are my commands
Go and climb that mountain Moses climb that mountain now and pray
Climb that mountain now and tell us what our Lord has had to say
Thou shalt have no Gods before me is my great command
And thou shalt not make any graven image by thy hand
Thou shalt not take my name in vain if thou would guiltless be
Remember thou to keep the sabbath day alone for me
Honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt not kill
Thou shalt not commit adult'ry and thou shalt not steal
Love thy neighbor as thyself and show thy neighbor peace
Covet not thy neighbor's house nor anything that's his
Go and climb that mountain
Moses showed these words of God to all the children then
They pulled up stakes and headed out to find the promised land
That Moses had described to them and told of comforts there
The children of oppression thought they'd not find anywhere
But they were soon to part from him and push alone awhile
For it was never meant for him to walk that final mile
The children cried if we must go on Moses without you
Then talk to God just one more time and tell us what to do
Go and climb that mountain
Thou shalt have no Gods before me


"Daddy Sang Bass"
I remember when I was a lad
times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people, that's all we were
Trying to make a living out of black land dirt
We'd get together in a family circle singing loud
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the Throne
No, the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Now I remember after work
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singing for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
But, I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Cause singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the Throne
Oh, no the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
At San Quentin


"At The Wailing Wall"
We're approaching the Wailing Wall now
Which is all that remains of the ancient temple the holiest place of the Jews
Jews of all sects all tribes from all over the world are coming to the Wailing Wall
You can hear some of the faithful
Praying in the background here before the Wailing Wall


"Come To The Wailing Wall"
Oh my Lord what a mornin' oh my Lord what a day
The sound of battle's over and the smoke has blown away
Come to the Wailing Wall come to the Wailing Wall
Thank God you can stand up on this Holy Land
And touch the hallowed rock that God delievered to our hand
Come to the Wailing Wall come to the Wailing Wall
Shout it cross the mountain shout it cross the sea
We have been delievered Israel is free
Come to the Wailing Wall
Bring the lost ones homeward lead them to this shore
The city gates are open heaven's blessing o'er
Come to the Wailing Wall


"In Bethlehem"
Now we are in the city of Bethlehem
At the door of the Church of the Nativity where Christ was born
The gate has been walled up then enters into the church because of the horsemen
That used to come attack the place and sack the church
It's been walled up to where there's just a very narrow opening of about
Three and a half feet where you enter into the Church of Nativity
So now we enter into the place where Christ was born
This is the place where Christ was born to the world over it's a mighty big place
Actually physically it's a small cave underneath the Church of the Nativity
Many other people are here today to see this place
Before me is the actual spot where Christ was born undisputed to the ages
This place was found and confirmed that it was the place of the Nativity
By St Helene mother of Constantine the Emperor of Rome
In the third and the fourth century
Just a few feet away from this place where Christ was born
Where there is a Star of Bethlehem in the manger
Where he was taken wrapped in swaddling clothes
Meaning loose
Where he was come and visited at this very spot by the three Wisemen from the east
One of the holiest of holy places
In the Christian tradition the Holy Family retreated here
During the massacre of the holy innocence ordered by King Herod
And just as we left the Church of the Nativity a few minutes ago
We saw another cave where so many of the children
That King Herod had killed under two years old were buried


"In Garden Of Gethsemane"
I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses
And he walks with me
And he talks with me
And he tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing
And he walks with me
And he talks with me
And he tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
I'd stay in the garden with Him
Tho the night around me be falling
But He bids me go
His voice to me is calling
And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known


"The Fourth Man"
They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knees to Idols made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the Fourth Man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn
Now the prophet Daniel tells about
Three men who walked with God
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
Before the wicked king they stood
And the king commanded them bound and thrown
Into the fiery furnace that day
But the fire was so hot that the men were slain
That forced them on their way
Now when the three were cast in and the king rose up
To witness this awful fate
He began to tremble at what he saw
In astonished tones he spake
Did we not cast three men bound
Into the midst of the fire
Well, Lo, I see four men unhurt
Unbound and walkin' down there
There's Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
And the fiery coals they trod
But the form of the Fourth Man that I see
Is like the Son of God


"On The Via Dolorosa"
We are on the Via Dolorosa the way of the Cross having just left the Praetorium
Where Pilate said to Christ I washed my hands off the matter
And turned him over to the people and told them to do what they would with him
There's no traffic here the streets's very narrow
Little children playing along the street the street's about ten feet wide
You see the third station of the Cross
Where Christ almost fell under the weight of the Cross
He's kneeling and the fourth station of the Cross over there
Over forty or fifty feet farther toward Calvary
Where His mother came up to Him and said my Son what's happened
And she sees Him kneeling under the heavy weight of the Cross too
Continuing on now toward Calvary from the fourth station of the Cross
We left the Praetorium where Christ was sentenced and where he was turned over
To the Jewish people and they were offered Barabbas and they said
No give us Christ we'll crucify him
Following along the stations of the Cross passing station No 5
And they say at this point that Simon a Cyrenean coming out of the country
On him they laid the Cross they made him bear it for Jesus
And they continued on the way of the Cross as we are now
Leaving place No 5 toward Calvary it's a long long way from here
You can see standing here between station No 5 and No 6
Two hundred yards at least up the steps toward Calvary's hill
All along it's a very narrow street ten or twelve feet wide
Shops on each side little children playing old men and women
Carrying their bread dressed in their long robes
Just as they did two thousand years ago
The music here in the background is a radio playing (is that an Arab station)
Still continuing up the way of the Cross toward Calvary
The voices you hear in the background are pilgrims from all over the world
All along the Via Dolorosa here there are beggars (I suppose mostly Arab beggars)
Passing station No 10 continuing on to Calvary they are all along the way
They say that they are all blind
They say that the reason there are so many blind along
This part of the country is because of the dust
Everywhere the wind is blowing and the dust is flying
And of course there are germs in the dust that diseases their eyes
And the dust itself puts them out
On the way to Calvary we pass another beggar sittin' along the way
All kinds of shops pilgrims continuing on the same way we're going
Now closer to Calvary the way really gets crowded
It's still the same very narrow street though


"Church Of The Holy Sepulchre"
Approaching the shrine now where the Cross was where Christ was crucified
Also the place of the Holy Sepulchre where Christ was buried
Entering into the actual church now which is covered not only the tomb
Where Christ was buried but also the place where he was crucified
There is a very interesting story about this place of Golgotha
They say that when Christ was crucified and His blood came down the cross
And incidentally we are climbing the steps right now
Going up to the place where He was crucified
When He was crucified and His blood ran down the Cross
It ran into the ground and His blood touched the skull of Adam
The very first man ever on earth created by God Adam
And that just for an instant the skull of Adam came to life
From the blood of Christ touching it


"At Cavalry"
And now here we stand in the approximate spot where the Cross stood
In this very spot supposedly on this very spot is
Where Christ was nailed to the Cross Laying flat on the ground
I don't think at this time that it really
After what I've seen today and what is just before me now
That it makes a lot of difference whether or not
This was exactly the very spot where Christ was crucified
And I feel proud in that I am able in my lifetime to come and stand
If not in the exact spot within a few feet or a few yards
At least of where it all happened
Where our Christianity began the most holiest of holy spots for the Christians
Now I would like myself to kneel before this place here underneath the table
Where the Cross was supposed to have stood
If it's definitely not the place it's near the place
After Christ was crucified He lay upon the Cross dying
After He was dead Roman soldiers cast lots for His clothes
There was a Roman soldier Marcellus
Who won this purple robe of Christ in a dice game
And legend has it story has it that Marcellus was affected very strongly by this robe
And the effects of having seen the Crucifixion he almost lost his mind
And everywhere he would go for months and years after that he was like a mad man
He would go to this one and that one stand there and say were you out there
Were you there were you there when they crucified Him


"God Is Not Dead"
When Jesus called to God upon the cross
No answer came for his will must be done
Then how the word trembled at his voice
When he said this is my beloved son
It isn't God but man that's dead
When love is locked outside
Do you deny that there's a God or is God just denied
God is not dead he never died
What man on earth can make one blade of grass
And who can make one seed then make it grow
With all the power and wisdom in our hands
Who can command which way the wind to blow
And who can match the miracle in an eagle's eye
Or hang a rainbow in a cloudy sky
God is not dead he did not die
God is not dead God is not dead


"Wanted Man"
Wanted man in California
Wanted man in Buffalo
Wanted man in Kansas City
Wanted man in Ohio
Wanted man in Mississippi
Wanted man in ol' Cheyenne
Wherever you might look tonight you might see this wanted man
I might be in Colorado
Or Georgia by the sea
Working for some man who may not know at all who I might be
If you ever see me coming and if you know who I am
Don't you breathe it to nobody 'cause you know I'm on the lamb
Wanted man by Lucy Watson
Wanted man by Jeannie Brown
Wanted man by Nellie Johnson
Wanted man in this next town
I've had all that I wanted of a lot of things I've had
And a lot more than I needed of some things that turned out bad
I got sidetracked in El Paso
Stopped to get myself a map
Went the wrong way in Juarez with Juanita on my lap
Went to sleep in Shreveport
Woke up in Abilene
Wonderin' why I'm wanted at some town half way in between
Wanted man in Albuquerque
Wanted man in Syracuse
Wanted man in Tallahassee
Wanted man in Baton Rouge
There's somebody set to grab me
Anywhere that I might be
And wherever you might look tonight
You might get a glimpse of me
Wanted man in California
Wanted man in Buffalo
Wanted man in Kansas City
Wanted man in Ohio
Wanted man in Mississippi
Wanted man in ol' Cheyenne
Wherever you might look tonight you might see this wanted man


"Wreck Of The Old '97"
Well they gave him his orders at Monroe, Virginia
Said
Steve, you're way behind time
This is not 38, this is Ol' 97
Put her into Spencer on time
Then he turned around and said to his black, greasy fireman
Shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Oak mountain
Watch Ol' '97 roll
And then a telegram come from Washington station
This is how it read
Oh that brave engineer that run ol 97
Is lyin in old Danville dead
Cos he was going down a grade making 90 miles an hour
The whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam
One more time
Oh, now all you ladies you'd better take a warning
From this time on and learn
Never speak hard words to your true
He may leave you and never return
Poor Boy


"I Walk The Line"
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
At San Quentin
I Walk The Line


"Darlin' Companion"
Darlin' companion, come on and give me understandin'
And let me be your champion: a hand to hold your pretty hand in
Darlin' companion, now you know you'll never be abandoned
Love will always light our landin': I can depend on you
Oh, a little saucy mare like you should have a steed
Oh, a little bridlin' down from you is what I need
Darlin' companion, now you know you'll never be abandoned
Love will always light our landin': I can depend on you
Darlin' companion, come on and give me understandin'
As long as we keep laughin', bear in mind just what could happen
Darlin' companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons
Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm gonna stick by you
Oh, a little saucy mare like you should have a steed
Oh, a little bridlin' down from you is what I need
Darlin' companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons
Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm gonna stick by you
Darlin' companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons
Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm gonna stick by you


"Starkville City Jail"
Well, I left my motel room, down at the Starkville Motel
The town had gone to sleep and I was feelin' fairly well
I strolled along the sidewalk 'neath the sweet magnolia trees
I was whistlin', pickin' flowers, swayin' in the southern breeze
I found myself surrounded
That's him
Come along, wild flower child. Don't you know that it's two a.m
They're bound to get you
Cause they got a curfew
And you go to the Starkville City jail
Well, they threw me in the car and started driving into town
I said
What the hell did I do
He said
Shut up and sit down
Well, they emptied out my pockets, took my pills and guitar picks
I said
Wait, my name is
Awe shut up
Well, I sure was in a fix
The sergeant put me in a cell, then he went home for the night
I said
Come back here, you so and so
Well, they're bound to get you, cause they got a curfew
And you go to the Starkville City Jail
I started pacin' back and forth, and now and then I'd yell
And kick my forty dollar shoes against the steel floor of my cell
I'd walk awhile and kick awhile, and all night nobody came
Then I sadly remembered that they didn't even take my name
At 8 a.m. they let me out. I said
Gimme them things of mine
They gave me a sneer and a guitar pick, and a yellow dandelion
They're bound to get you, 'cause they got a curfew
And you go to the Starkville City Jail


"San Quentin"
San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
You've hosted me since nineteen sixty three
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen them die
And long ago I stopped askin' why
San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and have scarred me thru an' thru
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man
Mister Congressman why can't you understand
San Quentin, what good do you think you do
Do you think I'll be different when you're through
You bent my heart and mind and you may my soul
And your stone walls turn my blood a little cold
San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good
San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me


"A Boy Named Sue"
My daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me
Sue
Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named
Sue
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky
And kill that man who gave me that awful name
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me
Sue
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said
My name is 'Sue
Now your gonna die
Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer
I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile
And he said
Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong
He said
Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Cause I'm the son
Sue.'
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George


"Peace In The Valley"
Oh well, I'm tired and so weary
But I must go alone
Till the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
Well the morning's so bright
And the lamp is alight
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me
Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me

"Folsom Prison Blues"
I hear the train a comin'
It's rolling round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone
When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin'
And that's what tortures me
Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
At San Quentin


"Big River"
Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die
I met her accidentally in St. Paul (Minnesota)
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport
And I followed you, Big River, when you called
Then you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river)
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone
Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough
She loves you, Big River, more than me
Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die


"I Still Miss Someone"
At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind has come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone
I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
because I still miss someone
Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
At San Quentin


"I Don't Know Where I'm Bound"
I don't know where I'm bound, I don't know where I'm bound
Whistles calling me away, leaving at the break of day
And I don't know where I'm bound
Can't stand bars, locks, or doors
Mean cops, insanity, and wars
Gotta find a place of peace
Until then, my traveling won't cease
But I don't know where I'm bound
There's gotta be a place for me
Under some green growing tree
clear cool water running by
An unfettered view of the sky
But I don't know where I'm bound
When I die, don't bury me
Cause then I must be free
Cremate my body with a grin
Throw my ashes to the wind
Cause I don't know where I'm bound
I don't know where I'm bound, I don't know where I'm bound
Whistles calling me away, leaving at the break of day
and I don't know where I'm bound
Got myself a little gal
She has been a downright pal
That old highway's calling me
And free I gotta be
But I don't know where I'm bound, I don't know where I'm bound
I don't know where I'm bound


"Ring Of Fire"
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire
[2x]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
The ring of fire, the ring of fire


"He Turned The Water Into Wine"
He turned the water into wine he turned the water into wine
In the little Cana town the word went all around that he turned the water into wine
Well he walked upon the Sea of Galilee he walked upon the Sea of Galilee
Shouted far and wide he calmed the raging tide and walked upon the Sea of Galilee
He turned the water into wine
He healed the leper and the lame he healed the leper and the lame
He said go and tell no man but they shouted it through the land
That he healed the leper and the lame
He turned the water into wine
He fed the hungry multitude yes he fed the hungry multitude
With a little bit of fish and bread they said everyone was fed
He fed the hungry multitude
He turned the water into wine


"Daddy Sang Bass"
I remember when I was a lad
times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people, that's all we were
Trying to make a living out of black land dirt
We'd get together in a family circle singing loud
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the Throne
No, the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Now I remember after work
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singing for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
But, I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Cause singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the Throne
Oh, no the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
At San Quentin


"The Old Account Was Settled Long Ago"
Well it was a time on earth when in the books of heaven
An old account was standing for sins yet unforgiven
My name was at the top and many things below
But I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees) long ago (I settled it all)
Yes the old account was settled long ago (hallelujah)
And the record's clear today cause he washed my sins away
And the old account was settled long ago
Well the old account was large and growin' every day
And I was always sinnin' and I never tried to pray
But when I looked ahead and saw such pain and woe
Well I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees)
Now sinner seek the Lord repent of all your sins
Cause this he has commanded if you would enter in
And then if you should live a hundred years below
Well you know you got it settled cause you settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees)


"Closing Medley"
I hear the train a comin'
It's rolling round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
Lord, I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
And that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone
[Spoken:]
Let's give her a big hand, June Carter
Helen, Anita, Mother Maybelle The Carter Family
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine

Son
That I want you to be a good boy, I don't want you to play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno, I shot him just to watch him die, Lord yeah
Now that train keeps a rollin', I hang my head down and cry
Johnny Yuma was the rebel he roamed through the west
Yeah Johnny Yuma the rebel he wandered alone
He got fightin' mad this rebel lad he packed no star as he wandered far
Where the only law was a hook and a draw the rebel Johnny Yuma
[Spoken:]
I wanna thank you for being so good to us. I like to say a special hello to all the men here at the prison that're not with us tonight If they couldn't find the key to the door or something. They couldn't let the bunch of them out here. I wish everyone of you could've be out here with us. All you guys I understand their pipe and the show in for you. Cell somewhere... that supposed... listening... maybe.Is that closed circuit television that you have in here, is it
Well if they'd freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it all a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away


"Bottom Of The Mountain"
I was born in West Virginia
Where the land is black with coal
For a man to feed his family
It takes twelve hours a day a diggin' in a dirty black hole
Way down in the bottom of a mountain
Way down in the bottom of a hole
Way down in the bottom of a mountain
I'm diggin' and a shovelin' and a loadin' out the dirty black coal
Some men give their wives jewelry
Some men give their wives gold
But all I can give to my sweet woman
Are the few dollars I make from diggin' out the dirty black coal
Way down in the bottom of a mountain
Way down in the bottom of a hole
Way down in the bottom of a mountain
I'm diggin' and a shovelin' and a loadin' out the dirty black coal
I draw script for most of my money
I never see a lot of that
I work all week and go to church on Sunday
Well the preacher gonna get what's left when they pass the hat
Way down in the bottom of a mountain
Way down in the bottom of a hole
Way down in the bottom of a mountain
I'm diggin' and a shovelin' and a loadin' out the dirty black coal
I'm diggin' and a shovelin' and a loadin' out the dirty black coal


"You Beat All I Ever Saw"
I've walked though every town
Saw fortunes lost and found
And when your trail failed i walked holes
In both my soles
But i don't expect you back
You're somewhere making tracks
I crossed the burning bridges
And walked through miles of sand
Met the lawless and the law
But you beat all i ever saw
I dreamed a million miles
About your eyes and smiles
I tried to love the best
And to turn from all the rest
But i'd scan the skies for you
And i only saw your hue
They drew away your mould
You were made of frozen gold
And your heart would never thaw
You beat all i ever saw
Rainbow


"Put The Sugar To Bed"
Out on a shrimp boat I just dropped the net
When the wind she come to blowin' whizzin' bad all to get
I look south east and golly me what I see
A black thundercloud with them fuzzy eyebrows
Come a lookin' direct towards boudleaux and me
I turned to boudleaux and me I said
Put the sugar to bed put the sugar to bed
Lock up the coffee in the coffee pot
Put the flour in your pillow cause it's all we got
Hang the lantern from the ceiling and watch your head
Ho boudleaux put the sugar to bed boudleaux put the sugar to bed
Well the sky she get dark and then she turn dark black
I yell she gonna blow one right out of the almanac
A big raindrop smacked me right on the ear
And I hollered hey boudleaux but the way the wind blow
He just as soon be deaf there wasn't no how to hear
I try to call to boudleaux but slid instead
Then me and boudleaux put the sugar to bed
Well the ends of that shrimpin' boat was switchin' around
She turned sideways and inners and outers and upside down
The water come in tryin' to drown the both of us
The closet top open and the shillet went a flyin' me I hit my head and kinda cuss
But most of all I frowned when she calm that I said
Put the sugar to bed put the sugar to bed
Ain't nothin' dry but my railroad watch the salt got soggy but we still can budge
We built a fire for the coffee and we chicory fed
Cause me and boudleaux put the sugar to bed
Me and boudleaux put the sugar to bed


"Girl In Saskatoon"
I left a little town
A little south of Hudson Bay
I couldn't find a thing, to make a rounder want to stay
I fought the wind across the baren waste in the crystal doom
Going for to marry the girl in Saskatoon
I'm glad I realized that no one could take her place
My heart was beating for her like the winter beat my face
But knowing that I'd see her made my spirit bright as June
I'm freezing but I'm burning for the girl in Saskatoon
South and West and following the cold December sun
I bedded down in the Carragana when my daily trek was done
Then up and pressing onward by the light of the morning moon
A prodical returning to the girl in Saskatoon
Then I found the trail that had packed beneath the snow
I made the final miles where the prairie lillies grow
The steeple on a church glistened by the prairie moon
I'm freezing but I'm burning for the girl in Saskatoon
My journey was forgotten
When I held her in my arms
My wonderlust was stiffled
By possesion of her charms
And even beneath the steeple
Where we couldn't wait till June
I found eternal spring with the girl in Saskatoon


"Time And Time Again"
I wish my heart was stone cause you're hard on flesh and bone
But even if my heart was stone I couldn't stand that long
Cause time and time again you're gone with the wind
And even when you're here I know you're making plans to go
You come back and I take you back but you like the shifting sand
And like the sand you shift right through my hands
Time and time again I got you time and time again
You come back and I take you back but you like the shifting sand
And like the sand you shift right through my hands
Time and time again I lose you time and time again
I wanna be your man so I give in all I can
And when I give in all I can I give up time and time again
You take whole of my hand and look at where I stand
Then I say this is my last stand time and time again
You come back and I take you back but you like the shifting sand
And like the sand you shift right through my hands
Time and time again I got you time and time again
Time and time again I lose you time and time again
Time and time again I got you time and time again


"Honky Tonk Girl"
Don't be fool by big blue eyes by a smile or a golden curl
Cause she'll love you now and then break every vow
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl
Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one
She knows all the arts of love she'll give your heart a twirl
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl
She can never change your ways though you'll give her all the world
She's had more than one or two and each day there's someone new
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl
Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one
She knows all the arts of love she'll give your heart a twirl
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl


"Locomotive Man"
I got a gal in Dallas, I wave at when I go through
I got a gal in Tulsa, that I toot my whistle to
(Say how do)
I got 'em all over the land, I'm a locomotive man
Left my heart in Omaha Omaha, and I never did quite get it back
I got a Sue in Sioux City, waitin' by the railroad track
(Keeps her money in a 'tater sack)
I got 'em all over the land, I'm a Locomotive man
Well, I left a little switch engine, 'bout forty miles south of Bangor Maine
Couldn't keep the wheels a turnin', shouldn't try to pull my train
I got 'em all over the land, I'm a Locomotive man
Well, I had a gal in Jackson, and it sure broke my heart to turn her loose
When I checked my time and moved on, she's hooked on my caboose
I got 'em all over the land, I'm a locomotive man


"Second Honeymoon"
I walked up to the desk and asked the man about a room
I asked about the bridal suite, I told him I'm the groom
Then I took the elevator to the floor I was assigned
I fumbled with the key the way I did that other time
Inside I thought of all the things that started in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon
I hear the happy people laughing in the street below
But the loneliness I feel tonight I hope you never know
The life that was a happy song has ended much too soon
And I'm alone on our second honeymoon
I look around the room and see you standing everywhere
The fragrance of your bridal flowers seems to fill the air
The blushing bride that gave me such a free and eager kiss
Two loving arms around me as you offered wedded bliss
We'd said that we'd return to live it over in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon
More Of Old Golden Throat


"I'll Remember You"
I'll remember you
Long after this endless summer has gone
I'll be lonely oh so lonely
Living only to remember you
I'll remember too
Your voice as soft as the warm summer breeze
Your sweet laughter, mornings after
Ever after, I'll remember you
To your arms someday I'll return to stay
Till then I will remember too
Every bright start we made wishes upon
Love me always, promise always
Oooh, youll remember too
More Of Old Golden Throat


"Wabash Blues"
Oh, those Wabash Blues
I know I got my dues
A lonesome soul am I
I feel that I could die
Candle light that gleams
Taunts me in my dreams
I'll pack my walking shoes
To lose those Wabash Blues


"Lorena"
The years creep slowly by, lorena
The snow is on the grass again
The sun's low down the sky, lorena
The frost gleams where the flowers have been
But my heart beats on as warmly now
As when the summer days were nigh
The sun can never dip so low
Or down affections cloudless sky
A hundred months have passed, lorena
Since last I held that hand in mine
And felt the pulse beat fast, lorena
Though mine beat faster far than thine
A hundred months, 'twas flowery may
When up the hilly slope we climbed
To watch the dying of the day
And hear the distant church bells chime
We loved each other then, lorena
More than we ever dared to tell
And what we might have been, lorena
Had but our lovings prospered well
But then, 'tis past, the years are gone
I'll not call up their shadowy forms
I'll say to them
lost years, sleep on
Sleep on
The story of that past, lorena
Alas
The hopes that could not last, lorena
They lived, but only lived to cheat
I would not cause e'en one regret
To rankle in your bosom now
For
if we try, we may forget
Were words of thine long years ago
Yes, these were words of thine, lorena
They burn within my memory yet
They touched some tender chords, lorena
Which thrill and tremble with regret
twas not thy woman's heart that spoke
Thy heart was always true to me
A duty, stern and pressing, broke
The tie which linked my soul with thee
It matters little now, lorena
The past is in the eternal past
Our heads will soon lie low, lorena
Life's tide is ebbing out so fast
There is a future
Of life this is so small a part
tis dust to dust beneath the sod
But there, up there, 'tis heart to heart
America: A 200


"Roll Call"
To Annabel in Memphis it was just another day
But her sweetheart and his buddies died ten thousand miles away
A captain sadly walked the muddy bloody battlefield
The smoke had cleared away and it was terrible and still
In his pocket was a roster of the falling fighting men
And the captain had his orders so the roll call begin
Atkins Baker Carter Calahan Clement Jones Johnson Moran
McCoy Perkins Rivers and Revere Stepherd Thomas Wilson what can of you here
The roll call was completed but no sign of life was there
Not one man had answered not one accounted for
He turned around and he walked away and looked up to the sky
When he heard his own voice echo and the answer from on high
Atkins (here) Baker (here) Carter (here) Calahan (here)
Clement (here) Jones (here) Johnson (here) Moran (here)
McCoy (here) Perkins (here) Rivers (here) and Revere (here)
Stepherd (here) Thomas (here) Wilson (yes sir we're all here)
We are present sir and all accounted for


"Southwind"
Southwind
You picked her up in Jacksonville
And left me cold and lonesome in the rain
South
You took her off to Nashville
Left me chokin' in the smoke behind the train
And you go whoooo
She's gone a
Southwind
I need a forty
And about this time tomorrow I'll be gone
Southwind
But if I had forty dollars
I would by myself a smile to carry on
And you go whoooo
She's gone again on the Southwind
Southwind
Take her fast and take her far
Cause that's the way she always likes to go
Southwind
I will be waitin' for the round trip
If you'll bring her back and I done told her so
Don't you go whoooo
She's gone again on the Southwind


"Devil To Pay"
Go on girl take your chances
See how long you can go on from man to man
I can read the lines between your stolen glances
And I know it's time to fold this loosing hand
Cause you're drawn to the flame by the thrill and the shame
Of the cheatin' game they taught you how to play
You've got nothing to lose but your soul girl
And you've only the devil to pay
You've been flying so high you don't know
That you're blind to the writin' on the wall
But some day you'll look down
And you'll find you've got no place to fall
When the bright lights're gone you'll be standing alone
Forsaken in the naked light of day
Then you'll know that it's all over but the dying
And you've still got the devil to pay
Join your friends while you got 'em
Cause you know they're gettin' fewer every day
You can't wait to let them take you to the bottom
And I'm gettin' tired of standin' in your way
But when you hit the ground don't come looking around
For the pieces of the love you threw away
That's the price of the high life you're livin'
And you still got the devil to pay
You've been flying so high you don't know
That you're blind to the writin' on the wall
But some day you'll look down
And you'll find you've got no place to fall
When the bright lights're gone you'll be standing alone
Forsaken in the naked light of day
Then you'll know that it's all over but the dying
And you've still got the devil to pay


"Cause I Love You"
I'll sweep out your chimney
yes and, I will bring you flowers
yes and, I will do for you
Most anything you want me to
If we live in a cottage
You will feel like it's a castle
By the royal way you're treated
And attention shown to you
I'll be there beside you
If you need a cryin shoulder
Yes, and I'll be there to listen
When you need to talk to me
When you wake up in the darkness
I will put my arms around you
And hold you till the mornin sun
Comes shinin' through the trees
I'll be right beside you
No matter where you travel
I'll be there to cheer you
Till the sun comes shinin through
If we're ever parted
I will keep the tie that binds us
And I'll never let it break
Cause I love you
I will bring you honey
From the bee tree in the meadow
And the first time there's a rainbow
I'll bring you a pot of gold
I'll take all your troubles
And I'll throw 'em in the river
Then I'll bundle down beside you
And I'll keep you from the cold
I'll be right beside you
No matter where you travel
I'll be there to cheer you
Till the sun comes shinin through
If we're ever parted
I will keep the tie that binds us
And I'll never let it break
Cause I love you
I Walk The Line


"See Ruby Fall"
Well I knew someday, Ruby would be leavin'
That she wasn't happy livin' quietly, quietly
Cause she would get the bedroom look each mornin'
And I felt Ruby pull away from me
Yeah, so go downtown about nine o'clock this evening
Walk under that red light and down the hall, down the hall
Look for the highest flyin' girl, that's Ruby
And if you wait your turn you'll see Ruby fall
Don't let her know that you even know me
She'll be tryin' to forget it all
And don't tell me how is was tonight, tomorrow
Cause I don't want to see Ruby fall
I didn't hold her back, when she got restless
One man is not enough when she wants it all
Yeah, I let her go when I saw what she wanted
Cause I don't care to see Ruby fall


"Route No. 1, Box 144"
His dying barely made the morning paper
And they summed it up in twenty words or more
Killed in action leaves wife and baby
At Route 1 Box 144
He grew up on a little farm just a couple of miles out of town
As a boy he worked in his daddy's field
And when his daddy could spare him
He hired out to the neighbors
For whatever they could pay him
He was thought of as just average a good boy
Nothing more the average amount of friends
He married his high school sweetheart
They brought a little plot of ground
Couple of miles out of town on a mailbox it said
Route 1 Box 144
Well back in town there were very few people that really knew him
Because he hardly ever came to town
Except for maybe on Saturdays of course the usual crew was always there
But he didn't spent a lot of times with the usual crew
He took care of his business
Bought what he had to have or could afford for his family
And went back to his little farm
With a baby on the way he went to the army and it was a short while
That the news came that he was killed in action
His body was sent back on a plane and then by train
And then they brought the body from the train station
To Route 1 Box 144
He never did great things to be remembered
He'd never been away from home before
But you'd've thought that he was president or something
At Route 1 Box 144


"Sing A Traveling Song"
Hey little girl with tears in your eyes
Don't waste your time now asking me why
I don't know I know I'll be moving along
You say that home is where my love is at
I said that home is where I hang my head
The time has come to sing a traveling song
You want a house and a lot of close friends
I love the feel of my back to the wind
The two won't match you know the cage they wile would be wrong
You think that love is friends a child and a home
You can't buy love on a twenty year alone
The time has come to sing a traveling song
Someday where we sat in your old porch swing
A tamer man may offer you a ring
A man that wants his friends and neighbors a child and a home
Don't waste your tears on love that never could be
What's right for others just ain't right for me
The time has come to sing a traveling song mhmm mhm


"If I Were A Carpenter"
If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway
Would you have my baby
If a tinker were my trade
would you still find me
Carrying the pots I made
Following behind me
Save my love through loneliness
Save my love for sorrow
I'm given you my onliness
Come give your tomorrow
If I worked my hands in wood
Would you still love me
Answer me babe
Yes I would
I'll put you above me
If I were a miller
at a mill wheel grinding
would you miss your color box
and your soft shoe shining
If I were a carpenter
and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway
Would you have my baby
Would you marry anyway
Would you have my baby


"To Beat The Devil"
And I'd like to dedicate this to John and June, who helped show me how to beat the devil
It was winter time in Nashville, down on music city row
And I was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the cold
To warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soul
Keep the chilly wind off my guitar
My thirsty wanted whisky
But it'd been of month of paydays since I'd heard that eagle scream
So with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar
Actually, I guess you'd could call it a Tavern
Cigarette smoke to the ceiling and sawdust on the floor
Friendly shadows
I saw that there was just one old man sittin' at the bar
And in the mirror I could see him checkin' me and my guitar
An' he turned and said
Come up here boy, and show us what you are
I said
I'm dry
He bought me a beer
He nodded at my guitar and said
It's a tough life, ain't it
I just looked at him. He said
You ain't makin' any money, are you
I said
You've been readin' my mail
He just smiled and said
Let me see that guitar
I've got something you oughta hear
Then he laid it on me
If you waste your time a
To the things that you are sayin', who do you think's gonna hear
And if you should die explainin' how the things that they complain about
Are things they could be changin', who do you think's gonna care
There were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind
Who were crucified for what they tried to show
And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time
Cos the truth remains that no
Well, the old man was a stranger, but I'd heard his song before
Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door
When no
And lonesome was more than a state of mind
You see, the devil haunts a hungry man
If you don't wanna join him, you got to beat him
I ain't sayin' I beat the devil, but I drank his beer for nothing
Then I stole his song
And you still can hear me singin' to the people who don't listen
To the things that I am sayin', prayin' someone's gonna hear
And I guess I'll die explaining how the things that they complain about
Are things they could be changin', hopin' someone's gonna care
I was born a lonely singer, and I'm bound to die the same
But I've got to feed the hunger in my soul
And if I never have a nickle, I won't ever die ashamed
Cos I don't believe that no


"Blistered"
I've got great big blisters on my bloodshot
Eyes from looking at that long legged woman up ahead
What she does simply walking down the sidewalk of the city
Makes me think about a stray cat getting fed
He's got a whole lotta motion in her sole, I know
But her sole ain't the place she lets it show
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
Lord I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah
She done tore my sole apart, put big blisters on my heart
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go
I've got great big blisters on my fingertips
From reaching in my pocket book and picking out the bills
And I got tiny white blisters in my throat
From trying to ease my nervous tension taking all them pat and pills
And ever since she started running around from bar to bar
I just can't eat a bite or keep my stomach settled down
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
She done got me, oh yeah
She done tore my soul apart, put big blisters on my heart
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
Oh I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Blistered, blistered


"Wrinkled Crinkled Wadded Dollar Bill"
I've got a lot of blues on my mind
And at least a million miles behind me
And all that I've got between me
And pauper's hill
Is a wrinkled, crincked, wadded dollar bill
Lake Michigan wind sure is cold
And I need me a jacket for my shoulders
I could buy one down at the surplus store
Cheap cotton twill
With my wrinckled crinckled wadded dollar bill
But I'm not bound
And I never will
Be to a wrinkled crinckled wadded dollar bill
It sure smells good at the bakery
And I stand and let the smell flood over me
They sell them day old cakes mighty cheeply
I could eat my fill
With my wrinkled, crinkled wadded dollar bill
But I'm not bound
And I never will
Be to a wrinkled, crinkled wadded dollar bill
Lake Michigan waves hit the beach
And I stand and let them wash at my feet
And then I throw it just as far as I can
Into the chill
My wrinkled, crinkled wadded dollar bill
For I'm not bound
And I never will
Be to a wrinkled crinkled wadded dollar bill
No I'm not bound
And I never will
Be to a wrinkled crinkled wadded dollar bill


"I've Got A Thing About Trains"
Train train train I've got a thing about trains
I get a sad kind of feeling when I see a passenger train
In this fast movin' world that we live in nobody rides 'em much these days
Maybe I'm a little sentimental cause I know that things have to change
But I'd still like to go for a train ride cause I've got a thing about trains
Train train train you're fading from the scene
But you've had your days of glory train train train
Train they say you're too slow for travelin' but I'm gonna miss you some day
When my little boy says daddy what was it like to ride a train
I'll just say it was a good way to travel when things didn't move quite so fast
And I'm sorry son that you can't ride one the trains are the thing of the past
Train train train you're fading from the scene
And I'm gonna mourn your passing train train train
I've got a thing about trains


"Jesus Was A Carpenter"
Jesus was a carpenter and he worked with a sow and a hammer
And his hands could form a table true enough to stand forever
And he might have spun his life out in the coolness of the mornings
But he put aside his tools and he walked the burning highways
To build a house from folks like you and me
And he found them as they wandered through the wild Judean mountains
And he found them as they pulled their nets upon the Sea of Galilee
And for a thousand evenings while the day behind him emptied
He walked among the poor and he stopped to touch the dying
And he built his house from people just like these
It was on a shining Sunday when he rode to old Jerusalem
And the palms they cast before him were the crimes they laid against him
It was on a stormy Friday when he climbed the streets of Calvary
And where he died today why they're sellin' beads and postcards
And they tell us too that that was long ago
But would he stand today upon the sands of California
Or walk the sweating blacktop in New York and Mississippi
Where the mighty churches rise above the screaming cities
Would he be a guest on Sunday a vagrant on a Monday
With the doors locked tight against his kind you know
Come again now Jesus be a carpenter among us
There are chapels in our discontent cathedrals in our sorrows
And we dwell in golden mansions with the sand for our foundations
And the raging water's rising and the thunder's all around us
Won't you come and build a house on rock again
Jesus was a carpenter


"Flesh And Blood"
Beside a Singin' Mountain Stream
Where the Willow grew
Where the Silver Leaf of Maple
Sparkled in the Mornin' Dew
I braided Twigs of Willows
Made a String of Buckeye Beads
But Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
I leaned against a Bark of Birch
And I breathed the Honey Dew
I saw a North
Against a Sky of Baby Blue
Beside the Lily Pads
I carved a Whistle from a Reed
Mother Nature's quite a Lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
A Cardinal sang just for me
And I thanked him for the Song
Then the Sun went slowly down the West
And I had to move along
These were some of the things
On which my Mind and Spirit feed
But Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
[SPOKEN]
So when this Day was ended
I was still not satisfied
For I knew ev'rything I touched
Would wither and would die
And Love is all that will remain
And grow from all these Seed
[SUNG]
Mother Nature's quite a Lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need


"I Walk The Line"
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
At San Quentin
I Walk The Line


"Hungry"
Grit my teeth and face a new day dawning take a deep breath then get up and go
Tie the same old weary shoes and walk the same old pathway
I never see a face that I don't know oh God if I could just pack up and go
Hungry for some other face hungry for some other place
Needin' something and I know what God I know what
I'm tired of seein' the same old road tired of carryin' the same old load
Hungry for something I ain't got
Her face across that table every morning and lately I don't notice that she's there
Always leave that breakfast table feelin' so damned empty
She knows there's something wrong but I don't care
Oh God how much more of this can I bear


"This Town"
This Town
This town is not for me
I won't be stayin' 'round
This town is hard and cold
I'm not happy in this town
I'll pick up my heart and I'll go
Where to I don't care or know
Don't matter where I'll be found
As long as I leave this town
This town wants me to go
It ain't where I was bound
This town don't need me here
I don't need this town
To morrow who'll remember my name
To morrow who'll remember I came
Don't care which road I'll go down
As long as it's a way from this town


"This Side Of The Law"
This Side of the Law
On this side of the law
On that side of the law
Who is right
Who is weak
Who is for and who
You see, I didn't really mean and harm
But I simply couldn't make it on the farm
When the land won't give a lot
You gotta do with what you got
And all I got's the muscle in my arm
Well, I wouldn't ever hurt my fellow man
And it seems to me that you could under stand
I'm just tryin' to help my self without hurtin' somebody else
And a man has got to do the best he can
On this side of the law
On that side of the law
Who is right
Who is weak
Who is for and who's against the law
Well, I didn't mean to let my fam'ly down
And I'm not giving you the run a round
I'd much rather be dead than have to beg my daily bread
And to pay my way no matter where I'm bound
Well, I didn't really think that I did wrong
So long as I stayed here where I belong
I did the only thing I could
Same as anybody would
And I was simply trying to get along
On this side of the law
On that side of the law
Who is right
Who is weak
Who is for and who's against the law

"Face Of Despair"
Fingers callus from the plough wrinkled weather beatin' brow
Streak of silver in the hair mhm face of despair
A back that's bent from years of toil thorns grow in the worn out soil
No one left to really care nhm face of despair
If you should plough old fields like these you'd plough up memories
Don't tell the young to mend their ways you can't show them better days
Their better days are yet ahead your better days have long been dead
Rest easy in your rocking chair mhm and look at your September country
Face of despair
Shoulders weary from the load life is rough as a gravel road
How much of it can you bear mhm look at your September country face of despair
In the September of your years eyes that hide a veil of tears
A look of longing always there mhm face of despair
If you should plough
Mhm if you should plough


"Standing On The Promise"
(Standing on the promises of Christ my King through eternal ages let his praises ring
Glory in the highest I will shout and sing
Standing on the promises of God
Standing standing standing on the promises of God my Saviour
Standing standing I'm standing on the promises of God)


"Amazing Grace"
Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed
When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we'd first begun


"The Preacher Said Jesus Said"
Well with everybody tryin' to tell us what to do
You wonder how are you to know whose word is true
But the preacher just keep on a bringing us a very same word
And from St Paul to Billy Graham the same is heard
And the preacher said of truth Jesus said
(And Jesus said I'm the way the truth and the life)
Well we can see that the world is full of greed
There's so much hate yet there is so much need
What should we do when no one seems to care
What can we do when there is no love there
And then the preacher said of love Jesus said
(Jesus said love Thy neighbor as Thyself)
Well please tell us the road we oughta go in such confusion how are we to know
And if there is a heaven show us to its gates
Oh you'd better tell us preacher before it's too late
And then the preacher said of heaven Jesus said
(Jesus said seek the first the kingdom of God and his righteousness
And all these things shall be added unto you)
Well please tell us we can find a way to climb every mountain that we face every day
And time of troubles what to depend upon to be the truth and help us carry on
And the preacher said of trouble Jesus said
(Jesus said let not your heart be troubled if you believe in God believe also in me
In my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you
I go to prepare a place for you
And if I prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself
That where I am there you may be also)


"Orphan Of The Road"
From a carny show and a rodeo that shared a three
A cowboy met a fiery carny queen
In new spring nights amid the lights of the painted carny van
They laughed and loved and shared short
But the carny show and the rodeo went their separate ways
And the carny season bloomed and soon moved on
And I was born on a winter morn to the dark
The too
The black
Unwanted son of ice and fire, an orphan of the road
I was still a child when my mama died of a chill that closed her eyes
So I was left to grow up on my own
Without a name, too wild to tame. No one cared to try
So mostly I was mostly left alone
In dingy bars and cold boxcars, hobo jungle camps
I joined the men who drift from town to town
The surgin' flood of restless blood flowed inside my veins
I'd never find the time to settle down
The black
In the misty rain, I caught the train that slowed down through the town
And I pulled myself into the boxcar door
In a passing light in the deep gray night, I saw the still dark form
Of an old man lying sick upon the floor
And he said
I tried to find her, but they told me that she'd died
And that she'd left an only son behind
And I tried to find him, but I never did, but I know I could rest in peace
If I could just see him once before I die
I found a match and I quickly scratched it into a flicker and flame
Then I held it close and I gently raised his head
My mother, sir
I said of her
I have her same dark eyes
He smiled a cowboy smile and then was dead
The black


"You've Got A New Light Shining In Your Eyes"
You've got a new light shining in your eyes
And I can see now right where your beauty lies
And it's showin' in your face that your heart has found a place
And I can hear it in your whisper and your sighs
You've got a new way of doing things you do
And it's plain to see there's been a change in you
And I wonder could it be that the change is due to me
For I have felt a certain something too
You've got a way about you now that you never had before
You've got a look you're wearin' now like no look you ever wore
I tried to hide it for a while but now I realize
You've got a new light shining in your eyes
You've got a way about you now that you never had before
You've got a look you're wearin' now like no look you ever wore
I tried to hide it for a while but now I realize
You've got a new light shining in your eyes
You've got a new light shining in your eyes


"If Not For Love"
A broken man moves slowly down the sidewalk
Humbled by the favours he must seek
From those that he encounters on his walk through misery
Who are rich enough to hurt just as they please
If not for love I could be one of these
An old man on a park bench stares with envy
At a couple with their children on their knees
While across the park a young man is caught by the police
Stealin' for a habit he must feed
And if not for love I could be one of these
I could be one of these or so many many more
Always at the beck and call of shame
I'm thankful I was called by love to walk among the happy
But if not for you love wouldn't know my name
A man of squander talents vainly calls on
His gift of God now straining through his soul
While in the crowd before him a jealous friend awaits
The moments that he can no longer please
And if not for love I could be one of these
I could be one of these or so many many more
Always at the beck and call of shame
I'm thankful I was called by love to walk among the happy
But if not for you love wouldn't know my name
Yes if not for love I could be one of these


"The Man In Black"
Well, you wonder why I always dress in black
Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on
I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who is long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the times
I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me
Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a Man In Black
I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men
And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believin' that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believin' that we all were on their side
Well, there's things that never will be right I know
And things need changin' everywhere you go
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white
Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that everything's okay
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back
Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black


"Singin' In Vietnam Talkin' Blues"
One mornin' at breakfast, I said to my wife
We been everywhere once and some places twice
As I had another helping of country ham
She said
We ain't never been to Vietnam
And there's a bunch of our boys over there
So we went to the Orient: Saigon
Well we got a big welcome when we drove in
Through the gates of a place that they call Long Vinh
We checked in and everything got kinda quiet
But a soldier boy said
Just wait 'til tonight
Things get noisy. Things start happenin'
Big bad firecrackers
Well that night we did about four shows for the boys
And they were livin' it up with a whole lot of noise
We did our last song for the night
And we crawled into bed for some peace and quiet
But things weren't peaceful. And things weren't quiet
Things were scary
Well for a few minutes June never said one word
And I thought at first that she hadn't heard
Then a shell exploded not two miles away
She sat up in bed and I heard her say
What was that
I said
That was a shell, or a bomb
She said
I'm scared
I said
Me too
Well all night long that noise kept on
And the sound would chill you right to the bone
The bullets and the bombs, and the mortar shells
Shook our bed every time one fell
And it never let up
Before it got any better
Well when the sun came up, the noise died down
We got a few minutes sleep, an' we were sleepin' sound
When a soldier knocked on our door and said
Last night they brought in seven dead, and 14 wounded
And would we come down to the base hospital, and see the boys
Yes
So we went to the hospital ward by day
And every night we were singin' away
Then the shells and the bombs was goin' again
And the helicopters brought in the wounded men
Night after night
Comin' and a goin'
So we sadly sang for them our last song
And reluctantly we said
So long
We did our best to let 'em know that we care
For every last one of 'em that's over there
Whether we belong over there or not
Somebody over here love's 'em, and needs 'em
Well now that's about all that there is to tell
About that little trip into livin' hell
And if I ever go back over there any more
I hope there's none of our boys there for me to sing for
I hope that war is over with
And they all come back home
To stay
In peace


"Ned Kelly"
In Australia a bandit or an outlaw was called a bushranger
One of Australia's most infamous bushrangers was a man named Ned Kelly
Ned Kelly was a wild young bushranger
Out of Victoria he rode with his brother Dan
He loved his people and he loved his freedom
And he loved to ride the wide open land
Ned Kelly was a victim of the changes
That came when his land was a sprout and seed
And the wrongs he did were multiplied in legend
With young Australia growing like a weed
Ned Kelly took the blame
Ned Kelly won the fame
Ned Kelly brought the shame
And then Ned Kelly hanged
Well he hid out in the bush and in the forest
And he loved to hear the wind blow in the trees
While the men behind the badge were coming for him
Ned said they'll never bring me to my knees
But everything was changed and run in cycles
And Ned knew that his day was at an end
He made a suit of armour out of ploughshares
But Ned was brought down by the trooper's men
Ned Kelly took the blame
Ned Kelly won the fame
Ned Kelly brought the shame
And then Ned Kelly hanged


"Look For Me"
Look for me there in the morning
When the clay of worthless ground
Is baked into the brick to build the church
That doesn't mind to wait with patience till it's found
He said children look for me look for me
Look for me late in the evening when the honey bear is lost
And hears a buzz of honey bees that leads him on and feeds him
Till his hunger feels at home he said children look for me look for me
Look for me look for me love will be there beside you
Love will be there to guide you look for me
He said help me to help you to help yourself to me
He said children look for love look for me
Look for me there in the hand
That drops a penny in the cup
And in the hand that lends its strength
To help the lonely through the night and lift the beggar up
He said children look for me look for me
Look for me there in the chill of dawn and in the newborn eyes
Of a baby left discarded by a girl we could offer nothing more
Than a small back alley prayer he said children look for me look for me
Look for me look for me love will be there beside you
Love will be there to guide you look for me
He said help me to help you to help yourself to me
He said children look for love look for me


"Dear Mrs"
Dear Mrs though we've never met I know very much about you
I know that you've got hair that shines like the morning sun
You've got eyes that hold the blueness of the sky
And of the deepest sea on a clear day and a smile that has a sparkle of a diamond
I know that because I've heard him say those things about you
These're the thoughts and the words of a man
Who spent many heart breaking years behind prison walls
The father of your children the man who worshipped the very ground that you walk on
He had a picture of you Mrs it was old and faded and torn
But you could tell at a glance that he never exaggerated in his thoughts and visions
He never left his cell without first checking to see if he had your picture with him
He was a young man when he first came to prison
And he talked a great deal about you but as the years passed he talked less and less
And during his last year here I don't believe he ever said a word to anybody
He had the appearance of a man much older than he really was
He walked with his head down and his shoulders saggin'
And the walk itself seemed to take a great deal of effort
He never received a letter or had a visitor while he was here in prison
But never did he stop looking and waitin'
Every day at mail call you could see him standing close to his bars
With the look of a child awaiting a reward
Even after the mailman had passed his cell his pleading eyes would follow beggin'
As always he'd feel of his shirt pocket and then just stand there
Staring at the emptiness and as always I could
Somehow feel the lump in his throat
And the burning in his eyes you know Mrs like just before you start to cry
Well I thought you might like to know that they buried his body today
Just outside the prison walls
They buried him there because nobody cared enough to claim his body
You know there was even a couple of old convicts there that actually cried
No not because they cared for him but for what he died from they cared for
Loneliness every prisoner knows loneliness but some know it more than others
The man that they buried today had died many times
Every day he waited hopin' and prayin' for a letter or a card
Or just a note or anything to let him know that somewhere out there
Somebody cared for him
That assurance never came and today he died Mrs
He died from loneliness starved for love a love that nobody ever wanted
You see no man woman or child is immune to the need of love or to be loved
No matter how terrible his crime might have been
The death he died from today was more inhuman
But his suffering is over now and he's resting in a pauper's grave in a prison suit
And in his pocket is an old torn and faded picture of yes of you Mrs


"I Talk To Jesus Every Day"
Well you talk about important people that you say you know
Presidents and superstars of big television shows
Well I know someone personally who's bigger than 'em all
And next to him your superstars look mighty small
And I have a talk with him each day and he's interested in every word I say
No secretary ever tells me he's been called away I talk to Jesus every day
Well now I don't think that I'll ever be in any Hall of Fame
And the social register of wealthy folks might drop my name
But my name is written in the book of life I'm proud to say
And that's all that really matters anyway
And I talk to Jesus every day and he's interested in every word I say
No secretary ever tells me he's been called away I talk to Jesus every day
I talk to Jesus every day


"Opening Dialogue"
[Dialogue:]
We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union
Had to have men like Columbus, De Soto, Lewis and Clark, Kit Carson, Daniel Boone, David Crockett, Eli Whitney, Sam Colt, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Orville and Wilbur Wright, my grandpa, and Paul Revere


"Paul Revere"
In April of 1775
This great nation started comin' alive
Ol' King George didn't like it one bit
So he proceeded to throw him a royal fit
He told his generals better get 'em back in line
Make 'em pay my taxes now America is mine
Stop that Independence cops before it gets around
Or it'll gonna be hard to hold them rebels down
Well the King was talking bout the men like Paul Revere
And the minute men who held their dream of Independence dear
They kept their eyes on the British they watched 'em day and night
They knew very soon they'd get their chance to stand and fight
Yes they knew that the British would get movin' any hour
So they arranged a signal in the Northern Church Tower
Paul was watchin' when the tower showed a light
And he started on his midnight ride
He jumped on his horse hoofs started a hummin'
He screamed out his warning redcoats're comin'
Better get your guns and your fightin' britches on
They're comin' and they're eight hundred strong
Next mornin' at Concord and Lexington town
The spirit of freedom turned the redcoats around
When we praise the men who made this mighty nation we have here
Then let's remember Paul Revere yes let's remember Paul Revere
I guarantee you somethin' and I wanna tell you all
That we never would've been here if it hadn't been for Paul
Yes sir I surely doubt us ever bein' here
If it hadn't been for that man on that horse named Mr Revere


"Begin West Movement"
1776 the thirteen colonies
Broke away from British rule and took a stand
We're on our own
they said
And they looked across the land
With a defiant challenge
They looked across the land
We will conquer you
the colonists said
We see your mighty mountains
We know of your lush green valleys
We're comin' to claim you, to tame you
And the 'Movement Westward' started


"The Road To Kaintuck"
We're goin' west to Kaintuck down the road to Moccasin Gap
Down the wilderness road
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap
There was a time when goin' way out west meant goin' to Kaintuck
The dark and bloody ground as Indians called it
Indians wars were ragin' and men like Daniel Boone and Michael Stoner
Came down the wilderness road like countless families did
Through a place in south West Virginia called Big Moccasin Gap
It's a hot day in '73 and this is my wife and my kids with me
Daniel Boone lost his boy the other day young Jim Boone is dead twenty miles away
The wagons turn and went back home even Daniel couldn't make it alone
I guess prob'ly Daniel could but he stopped awhile in castle wood
(If you love your wife and love your baby man
Turn your wagons back as soon as you can
Ev'ry Injun in these hills has gone berserk you never gonna make it to Kaintuck)
Ah I bet I'm gonna make it to Kaintuck
We're goin' west to Kaintuck down the road to Moccasin Gap
Down the wilderness road
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap
America: A 200


"To The Shining Mountains"
Yes, went they through the Lehigh Valley
To Lake Erie past Virginia
And the land called out its challenge
Bring your men to match our mountains
See the green Ohio Valley
See the Cumberland, the Wabash
On the Tennessee they floated
On great rafts to the Mississippi
And the Cherokee and Shawnee
And the Creek and The Ojibwa
And the Choctaw and the Quapaw
And all the tribes along the rivers
that they were coming
That the white man was upon them
They built their homes along the rivers
Built their churches, brought their preachers
Came upon the white misery
Stopped before the shining mountains
Many died from the beginning
For the freedom of America
Like that day down in New Orleans


"The Battle Of New Orleans"
In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in the town of New Orleans
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin' on
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
We looked down the river and we see'd the British come
And there must have been a hundred of'em beatin' on the drum
They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring
We stood by our cotton bales and didn't say a thing
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin' on
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
If we didn't fire our muskets 'til we looked 'em in the eye
We held our fire 'til we see'd their faces well
Then we opened up with squirrel guns and really gave 'em ... well
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin' on
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin' on
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico


"Remember The Alamo"
And a hundred and eighty were challenged by Travis to die
By the line that he drew with his sword when the battle was nigh
Any man that would fight to the death crossed over
But him that would live, better fly
And over the line went a hundred and seventy nine
Hey Santa Anna, we're killing your soldiers below
That men, wherever they go will remember the Alamo
Bowie lay dying, but his powder was ready and dry
Flat on his back, Bowie killed him a few in reply
And young David Crockett was singing and laughing
With gallantry fears in his eyes
For God and for freedom, a man more than willing to die
Hey Santa Anna, we're killing your soldiers below
That men, wherever they go will remember the Alamo
And then they sent a young scout from the battlements, bloody and loud
With the words of farewell from a garrison valiant and proud
Grieve not little darling, my dying, if Texas is sovereign and free
We'll never surrender and ever with liberty be
Hey Santa Anna, we're killing your soldiers below
That men, wherever they go will remember the Alamo


"Opening The West"
And the shining Rocky Mountains looked down on the people coming
Strong and sturdy freedom lovin' settlers cowboys pioneers
Now no foreign crown would rule them
Now a nation strong was standing even bigger was it growing
Added Iowa, Wisconsin then broke through the shining mountains
Staked a claim on California
Panned the gold out of its rivers irrigated desert valleys
Oregon, Minnesota, Kansas now were added to the total
Making 34 to number of the States now in the Union
And the years 1860 to 65 the history books're full of it
The sadness the heartbreak and the songs of that period
Tell us of a sadness and of a heartbreak when the nation was torn asunder


"Lorena"
The years creep slowly by, lorena
The snow is on the grass again
The sun's low down the sky, lorena
The frost gleams where the flowers have been
But my heart beats on as warmly now
As when the summer days were nigh
The sun can never dip so low
Or down affections cloudless sky
A hundred months have passed, lorena
Since last I held that hand in mine
And felt the pulse beat fast, lorena
Though mine beat faster far than thine
A hundred months, 'twas flowery may
When up the hilly slope we climbed
To watch the dying of the day
And hear the distant church bells chime
We loved each other then, lorena
More than we ever dared to tell
And what we might have been, lorena
Had but our lovings prospered well
But then, 'tis past, the years are gone
I'll not call up their shadowy forms
I'll say to them
lost years, sleep on
Sleep on
The story of that past, lorena
Alas
The hopes that could not last, lorena
They lived, but only lived to cheat
I would not cause e'en one regret
To rankle in your bosom now
For
if we try, we may forget
Were words of thine long years ago
Yes, these were words of thine, lorena
They burn within my memory yet
They touched some tender chords, lorena
Which thrill and tremble with regret
twas not thy woman's heart that spoke
Thy heart was always true to me
A duty, stern and pressing, broke
The tie which linked my soul with thee
It matters little now, lorena
The past is in the eternal past
Our heads will soon lie low, lorena
Life's tide is ebbing out so fast
There is a future
Of life this is so small a part
tis dust to dust beneath the sod
But there, up there, 'tis heart to heart
America: A 200


"The Gettysburg Address"
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate


"The West"
Then came West Virginia came Nevada and Nebraska
Colorado and Dakota, Washington, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming
And the West was opened up
And for ther first time it seems
That the nation was really conscious of itself as a nation
Railroad tracks crossed the land as did telegraph wires
Public opinion and great ideas were now reflected on a national basis
And never in this land before us and never more hereafter
Will a land know such a people as a man we call a cowboy
His hat and his bandana his unique brand of lingo
All his devil deeds of daring bold and skillful in the saddle
Brave and daring in the rambling wild and eager in exploring
Land that calls him with a challenge
But the land was already claimed by a people
When the cowboy came and when the soldiers came
The story of the American Indian is in a lot of ways a story of tragedy
Like that day at Wounded Knee South Dakota


"Big Foot"
But the land was already claimed by a people when the cowboy came and when the soldiers came
The story of the American Indian is in a lot of ways a story of tragedy
like that day at Wounded Knee, South Dakota
Big Foot was an Indian chief
Of the Minneconjou band
A band of Minneconjou Sioux
From South Dakota land
Big Foot said to Custer
Stay away from Crazy Horse
But Custer crossed into Sioux land
And he never came back across
Then Big Foot led his people
To a place called Wounded Knee
And they found themselves surrounded
By the 7th Cavalry
Big chief Big Foot
Rise up from your bed
Minneconjou babies cry
For their mothers lying dead
Big Foot was down with a fever
When he reached Wounded Knee
And his people all were prisoners
Of the 7th Cavalry
Two hundred women and children
And another hundred men
Raised up a white flag of peace
But peace did not begin
An accidental gunshot
And Big Foot was first to die
And over the noise of the rifles
You could hear the babies cry
Big chief Big Foot
It's good that you can't see
Revenge is being wrought
By Custer's 7th Cavalry
Then smoke hung over the canyon
On that cold December day
All was death and dying
Around where Big Foot lay
Farther on up the canyon
Some had tried to run and hide
But death showed no favorites
Women, men, and children died
One side called it a
massacre
The other a
victory
But the white flag is still waving
Today at Wounded Knee
Big chief Big Foot
Your Minneconjou band
Is more than remembered here
In South Dakota land


"Like A Young Colt"
Like a young cold the country was now growing fast
Passenger trains in the east were traveling a hundred miles an hour
People in the country could buy clothes by mail order
And get 'em back within two weeks
After twenty years or more the South
Was still mending its wounds from the civil war
But with all the country's problems
The union was solid
Red American novelists and poets
Were coming into their own
People were expressing their love
For America in song and in poem
And in South Carolina
A high tone southern gentleman
Expressed his love and admiration
For his president James A Garfield in such a way


"Mister Garfield"
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Me and my brother was down close to the depot when I heard the report of a pistol
My brother run out and come back in all excited
And I said what was it and he said it was the report of a pistol and then he said
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Lord I knew the President was supposed to be at the depot that day
And we just would't believe that he's shot
But we'd run over there and there was so many folks around
That we couldn't see him but some lady was standin' there cryin'
And I said m'am what was it that happened m'am and she said
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Well everybody drifted off toward home finally
And they looked like they felt about as bad as I did
But in a few weeks I heard that the President was still alive
And I told my brother I said let's get on that train and go to where he's laid up hurt
Well when we got to his big house up there I asked the fellow
I said who was it that did it who was it that shoot the President
And he said it was Charlie Guiteau that shoot Mr. Garfield and I said
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man good man
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man low
I heard some fellow there that had been in the house to see the President
And I sidled up him to listen to what he was tellin' and he said
Mrs Lucretia Garfield was always at his side
In the heat of the day fannin' him when he was hot
He said that just that day the President said to Mrs Lucretia
He said Crete honey (he called her Crete)
Said if somethin' worse happens to me after awhile you get yourself a good man
And Mrs Lucretia said James (she called him James)
She said I won't hear to that now she said I love you too much but he said
You'll make some good man a good wife good wife
You'll make some man a good good good wife
(Don't pull in single harness all your life good gal
Don't pull in single harness all your life)
That's what he said don't pull in single harness all your life
Well a few days later I come back to where the President was restin'
And it seems everybody was cryin'
The flag was hangin' halfway up to the flagpole in front of the house
And everybody looked so sad and I asked a soldier boy there
And I said is is is Mr. Garfield and he said yeah he's gone
Gonna lay him in that cold lonesome ground down low
Gonna lay him in that cold lonesome ground
Well they laid the President by that long cold branch Mr. Garfield's been laid down low
Mr. Garfield has been shot dow Mr. Garfield's been shot
(Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low)


"A Proud Land"
Then came Utah, Oklahoma, New Mexico was 47
48 was Arizona and the land was all a Union
Now a proud strong land swelled its chest and kept on growing
She survived many wars but now the great war the war to all the wars
Dealth her a stunning blow
Two million men shipped overseas to help win the great war


"The Big Battle"
I think sir the battle is over, and the young soldier lay down his gun
I'm tired of running for cover, I'm certain the battle is done
For see over there where we fought them, it's quiet for they've all gone away
All left is the dead and the dying, the blue lying long side the grave
So you think the battle is over, and you even lay down your gun
You carelessly rise from your cover, for you think the battle is done
Now boy hit the dirt, listen to me, for I'm still the one in command
Get flat on the ground here beside me, and lay your heart to the sand
Can you hear the deafening rumble, can you feel the trembling ground
It's not just the horses and wagons that make such a deafening sound
For every shot fired had an echo and every man killed wanted life
There lies your friend Jim McKinney, can you take the news to his wife
No son the battle's not over, the battle has only begun
The rest of the battle will cover the part that has blackened the sun
The fight yet to come is not with cannon, nor will the fight be hand
No one will regroup the forces, no charge will a general command
The battle will rage in the bosom of mother and sweetheart and wife
Brother and sister and daughter will grieve for the rest of their lives
Now go ahead, rise from your cover, be thankful that God let you live
Go fight the rest of the battle for those who gave all they could give
I see sir the battle's not over, the battle has only begun
The rest of the battle will cover this part that has blackened the sun
For though there's no sound of the cannon and though there's no smoke in the sky
I'm dropping the gun and the saber and ready for battle am I


"On Wheels And Wings"
Now the nation moved on wheels
Will Rogers said we hold the distinction on being the only nation
In the history of the world ever to go to the poorhouse in an automobile
Ha ha ha well the country went to the poorhouse all right
Then it got back to its feet
To become the mose powerful nation in the history of the world


"Come Take A Trip On My Airship"
Come take a trip in my airship come take a trip round the stars
Come take a sail around Venus come take a sail around Mars
No one to watch while we're kissing no one to see while we spoon
Come take a trip in my airship we'll visit the Man in the Moon


"Reaching For The Stars"
Add Alaska and Hawaii make the total half a hundred
Half a hundred states united joined together as one body
Arms that reach across the northland to the far off state Alaska
Arms that reach across the water to the far off state Hawaii
Arms of some two hundred million
Thanking God for having brought us safely thus far in our journey
We're reaching for the stars that beckon reaching for the stars that call us
And we answer back still louder by the power of God that brought us
We are reaching we are reaching reaching for the stars tomorrow


"These Are My People"
These are my people this is the land where my forefathers lie
These are my people in brotherhood we're heirs of a creed to live by
A creed that proclaims that by loved ones blood stains
This is my land and these are my people
These are my people they were born on and lived by the land
These are my people and their cities were raised by hard working hands
And their faces to tell that they're holding on well
To this their land yes these are my people
These are my people these are the ones who will reach for the stars
These are my people that a light of the earth you can tell they are ours
A new step to take and a new day will break
For this my land yes these are my people these're my people hmm


"Narration"
Silent Night
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
That means Christmas to some people
A lot of people from different parts of the country and all over the world
Have different ways of celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ
The prophets of old had foretold of his comin' for four thousand years
And a lot of people say that the wise men from the East were probably astronomers
That may have studied the stars and knew that the new star that was gonna
To appear in the East the time of it was at hand
A lot of others of course say that they were told by God
That the star was about to appear so they could begin their long journey
From the East and where was the East
Some people say it could have been India some people speculate
That one of the wise men came from as far away as Korea all away cross Asia
And he must have been a comin' for many months maybe
Maybe even years to get to the place where that new star
That was to hang over that manger in the town of Bethlehem
Ten miles from Jerusalem
Whatever the shepherds came in from the fields
And you know it's really somethin' that a shepherd would leave his flock
To come in for anything because that was really about a crime for a man to do
That was shepherd to leave his flock of sheep
And come in for anything because the sheep were man's lively hood
The milk and the meat and the wool for the clothing
It really took something for a shepherd to leave a flock
And there were a lot of 'em that did it and came in to worship the new baby Jesus That was born in the manger
The wise men came bearing gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh
And they brought them and laid them at the foot of the manger where Jesus lay
And you know the voice of God so the scriptures say
According to the scriptures had been silent for four hundred years
There had not been a divinely inspired prophet for four hundred years
And all of a sudden you can imagine what kind of night it must have been
For a new star to suddenly appear out of the heavens
And shepherds to leave their flock and men
Wealthy lookin' strangers come in from the East
And all of a sudden on top of all that a heavenly choir to start to singin'
Singin' voices from heaven,singing words that they understood
Words like peace on Earth good will to men


"King Of Love"
He wants to own your heart
He already owns your soul
No matter what you do
He's always in control
And when he calls your name you have to follow
Like moths into a flame, no fear or sorrow will fall upon you
You belong to the King of Love
He wants to know your thoughts
He already knows your mind
No matter where you are
You're someone he'll always find
His very mention brings the slightest shudder
Deep inside you know there is no other as skilled and tender
Just surrender to the King of Love
But when the night falls down, he will not wear a crown
No jewels upon his hands, he is just a man
He wants to rule your world
He already rules your dreams
No matter what you want
He'll never make you Queen
Still when he calls your name you have to answer
And when his music plays you are a dancer for him the only
Never lonely, King of Love
For him the only, never lonely, King of Love

That's a night we are celebratin' at Christmas time
And according to Marshall Grant up in Flatts,North Carolina
They had their own way of celebratin' Christmas too
Marshall what did you get for Christmas say when you were six years old
[Marshall]
When I was six years old or there about the biggest present that I could ever remember gettin'
Was somethin' like a little hatchet or a french harp
I remember one year that I got a hatchet and Odell got a french harp
And he wanted my hatchet and I didn't want his french harp
But he got what he wanted and everythin' but there was fourteen of us
In that little house up in Flatts North Carolina
There was one thing that we did have and at that time of year and that was love
All of us loved one another and it was cold
Always cold with the little fireplace but the room felt so warm
And it was really warm even though there was a lot of scrambling
Over the gifts that we got swappin' back'erds and forth
From all the brothers and sisters
It was really warm in Flatts North Carolina always on Christmas
[Johnny]
I think probably a lot of people might wonder as I did where is Flatts North Carolina
[Marshall]
Well I tell you Flatts North Carolina it's about eighty miles from Ashville
And you go through Cherokee and Brison City
And you get to a little place called Maddy Hill in North Carolina
[June]
But that ain't it
[Marshall]
No
[Johnny]
Then you go up the wind
[Marshall]
You take a little left there at Maddy Hill if you're goin' east
And you go up the windin' stairs for fourteen miles and you round about a dozen bends
And all of a sudden, there is no sign, and if you ask anybody up there
Where Olson Grant lives that's Main Street


"Jingle Bells"
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse sleigh hey
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go laughing all the way(ha ha ha)
Bells on bobtail ring making sprits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Oh Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh Hey
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
You know I hate the cold
That's why I always go
Down south to drink some rum
On a island in the sun
There's nothing like St. Barts
With the palm trees swaying slow
Or being there on Jost Van Dyke
When the New Year comes and goes
Oh jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh hey
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

[Johnny]
I remember teachin' my brother Tommy shoot fire crackers
Both of us gettin' our fingers busted you remember that Tom
Daddy started Christmas mornin' with a stick of dynamite
And he made sure ev'rybody else was up
[Tommy]
When daddy gets up he wants to make sure ev'rybody else in the world is up too
[Johnny]
He did when we were kids remember when he could get dynamite bang Joy To The World
[Don:]
What was is like up in the Stanton Virginia about that time of the year Harold
[Harold]
Oh we had I guess about like ev'rybody's Christmas it's always that Christmasy feeling
I remember one year I had an uncle that came in filled with the spirit
And he was lovin' all us kids and ev'rything and we's tryin' to get away from him
And he fell in the Christmas tree and knocked it over
We stood him up in the corner and decorated him
I don't remember what I got that year but I remember what he got
My mama run him out of the house finally


"That Christmasy Feeling"
When the days of December are numbered
And the earth begs it's snowflakes to fall
That's the time of the year that Christmas is here
With peace and goodwill for all
How I love that Christmas feelin'
How I treasure it's friendly glow
See the way a stranger greets you
Just as though you'd met him Christmas's ago
Christmas helps you to remember
To do what other folks hold dear
What a blessed place the world would be
If we had the Christmas feelin' all year


"My Merry Christmas Song"
Merry Christmas Mary thank you for the child
Thank you for Lord Jesus thank you for the child
Christmas time is here again peace on Earth good will to men
The air is filled with joyful sounds merry wishing all around
Giving and receiving gifts stopping by to thank all of our friends
And we thank you Mary for helping give God's greatest gift to man
Merry Christmas Mary thank you for the child
Thank you for Lord Jesus thank you for the child
Merry Christmas Mary to often we forget
To thank you for your part in giving the greatest Christmas present yet
Merry Christmas Mary


"Merry Christmas Mary"
Joseph was tired
They'd been traveling all day
And it was almost midnight
Before he found a place to stay
He put the burrow in the stall
Then knelt beside his wife
To comfort her
As she went through
The pain of giving life
And up above a star was shining brightly in the sky
Joseph held the baby child
And showed him to his wife
And he said
Merry Christmas, Mary
Let me be the first to say
Merry Christmas, Mary
The son of God has come to us today
There was someone at the door
And Joseph turned to see
Some plain and simple shepherd men
Down on bended knee
They talked about an angel
Who told them where to come
In the middle of the night to see
God's only son
Then later there came wisemen
Bearing gifts and offerings
And Joseph led them all to see
And praise the new born king
And they said
Merry Christmas, Mary
Let us be the first to say
Merry Christmas, Mary
The son of God has come to us today
Tears of joy
Were gently flowing
Out of Joseph's eyes
While up above the angels sang
Glory to God
Merry Christmas, Mary
Let us be the first to say
Merry Christmas, Mary
The son of God has come to us today
The son of God has come to us today


"Narration"
[Johnny]
How did how did pop Carter which is June's father
Mama how did he celebrate Christmas when you all were first married
[Maybelle]
When we first married
[June]
Mama he didn't have a great big old copper kettle somewhere hid up in the mountain
[Maybelle]
June can tell you that story John
But I will tell you that he used to go buy a bushel of apples
And a bushel of oranges and fruit like that for the girls
And he'd divided in three three ways and they could do what they wanted to
If they want to give it away okay they couldn't have none of the rest of the others see
Their's had to last them through Christmas and you know
They couldn't go to one of the other girls and say
Hey gimme some of your fruit mine's all gone
[June]
I want to tell you that story about how you asked about the celebratin'
Back years ago they didn't have too much to celebrate with
Up in that country unless you made your own
And my father somewhere had him the dandiest copper kettle with little pipes
Goin' out all over it somewhere up in the hills
[Harold]
My uncle knew him
[June]
And my grandmother Carter was quite a woman
And she never said one word to my daddy
But she was always goin' into Clinch Mountain huntin' wood
And draggin' it down on her back
And she came out of there one day draggin' that great big ol' forked stick
With a copper kettle right on the end of it
And she was my father's name was Ezra Carter and she'd say Ezra
She said oh Ezra said look here Ezra
I found the dandiest copper kettle for makin' apple butter
And he never said a word
[Anita]
And we always had good apple butter


"Christmas Time's A"
Christmas time's a
Christmas time's a
Snowflakes are falling, my old home's a calling
Tall pines are humming, Christmas time's a
Can't you hear them bells ringing, ringing joy, joy hear them singing
When it's snowing I'll be going back to my country home
Christmas time's a
Christmas time's a
Holly's in the window, home's where the wind blows
Can't walk for running, Christmas time's a
Can't you hear them bells ringing, ringing joy, joy hear them singing
When it's snowing I'll be going back to my country home
Christmas time's a
Christmas time's a
White candles burning, my old heart's a yearning
For the folks at home when Christmas time's a
Can't you hear them bells ringing, ringing joy, joy hear them singing
When it's snowing I'll be going back to my country home
Christmas time's a

"Narration"
How bout your Christmas Flute
I think maybe eh that I enjoy Christmas now more than I did back then
Because I think seein' my my family wife and two kids get things that they like
I enjoy that more than anything more than the Christmas years ago is the Christmas we have now
And eh course I know I was real fortunate in not ever havin


"Christmas With You"
It's so nice to spend Christmas with you
The times that I've seen Christmas come and go are now two score
I wish you a merry Christmas and I wish you a many more
It's good to see the children laugh with joy the way they do
And it's nice to spend Christmas with you
That old fashioned Christmas is a sweet memory
Except for all the Christmasses that you weren't there with me
But now I really feel the spirit cause I love you like I do
And it's nice to spend Christmas with you
I remember Christmas when I little could afford
And I try to remember it's the birthday of our Lord
Well I'll not forget to thank him for his blessing's on me too
And that I can spend Christmas with you
That old fashioned Christmas
It's so nice to spend Christmas with you


"Narration"
Yes times was hard along about that time
We were lucky if we had a radio battery
But as John says in his song
We were all together which meant more than anything else
Well Mama I'll dedicate this to you and ask Mother Maybelle Carter to play it
This is Christmas as I knew it


"Christmas As I Knew It"
One day near Christmas when I was just a child
Mama called us together and mama tried to smile
She said you know the cotton crop hadn't been too good this year
There's not a lot of spending money and well at least we're all here
I hope you won't expect a lot of Christmas presents
Just be thankful that there is plenty to eat
That'll make things a little more pleasant
And us kids got to thinking how really blessed we were
At least we were all healthy and most of all we had her
Roy cut down a pine oak tree and we drug it home Jack and me
Daddy killed a squirrel and Louise made the bread
Reba decorated the tree with popcorn strings before we went to bed
Mama and daddy sacrificed because this Christmas was kind of lean
After all there was the babies Tom and Joanne
And babies need a few things
I whittled a whistle for my brother Jack
And though we disagreed now and then
When I gave Jack that whistle he knew I thought the world of him
Mama made the girl's dresses out of flower sacks
And when she ironed them down
You couldn't tell that they hadn't come from town
A sharecropper family across the road didn't have it as good as us
They didn't even have a light and it was way past dusk
And mama said
Well I bet they don't even have coal oil
Let alone apples and oranges and such
Me and Jack took a jar of coal oil nd some hickernuts we'd found
We walked to the sharecropper's porch and set 'em down
A poor old ragged lady eased open the door
She picked up the coal oil and hickernuts and said
I sure do thank you
and quickly closed the door
We started back home me and Jack
And about halfway we stopped looked back
And in the sharecropper's window at last was a light
So for one of the neighbors and for us it was a good Christmas night
Christmas came and Christmas went
Christmas that year was heaven sent
And my daddy put on his rubber boots
And paced the floor waiting for the thaw
Back home in Dyess Arkansas

"Narration"
You know Carl Perkins and I lived right across the Mississippi River from each other
I bet you coulda heard my Daddy shootin' that dynamite on Christmas mornin' if you'd been listenin' Carl
John I probably did cause we didn't have a lot of nothin'
I memeber we drug one ole firecracker around and wore it out we's afraid to light it
Things in Lake County wadn't too bright but kinda like Marshall said we kinda filled up on love around that time of the year
That's when the crops was all out and eh I remember my folks my mom and dad kinda pinched the pennies
And that's when we got our new overall britches
I kinda strutted around pretty good on Christmas Day with those on
But Christmas to me is a sad and a warm time of the year
We did a lotta singin' that's about all we had
And that wadn't too good
But there's a lotta sweet memories over in Lake County for me


"When You're Twenty"
It was Christmas Eve the night your poor Maw died son
And I reckon she prayed all of her life that she could raise you to be twenty
Me and you never moved into town boy we just kept on livin' out here
Aw and life's been good and bad Son for the past twenty
Oh I remember now when you were a little fella and I used to take my boy to church
And when you sang the Christmas carols with the other boys oh it gave Daddy's heart a jerk
Why you sounded a lot like a little angel Boy
And to Papa you sure looked sweet
Even though your little ragged britches came half way to your skinny little knees
Oh and it made your Poppa proud boy and it filled my ole heart with joy
The Preacher'd step down and he'd pat your head and he say
My my got yourself a fine little boy
Well maybe my life down here's about over boy
Maybe my days on earth's about done
Maybe now I'll see your Mama and live with the Lord boy
But Merry Christmas to you and a happy birthday Son


"An Old Fashioned Tree"
How I miss that old fashioned Christmas
Carols being sung by the tree
Window's candlelight shining bright for the whole world to see
Children's eyes of sweet expectations
Wondering what each present will hold
Lying in their beds and impatient
On long Christmas eves of old
It used to be that all the family would gather for this one night
It used to be that special feeling shared together knowing Christmas was here one night a
Year
How I miss that old fashioned Christmas
Memories that last through the years
Call me sentimental
I wish an old fashioned Christmas to you
They tell me
Somewhere this life isn't crazy
But I've travelled the world far and wide
And I say they're wrong
Don't sell me
Stories that music's a lady
It's not when the singer's alone
At the end of a song
At the end of a song
There's no one
After the last note is played
Only the memory stays
Then even that fades away
And there's nothing so hard
As convincing your heart
That you should start singing again
You told me
Nothing could change perfect lovers
But like ev'ry promise you made
It broke before long
It's lonely
Falling away from each other
But we've come to the last of your words
And the end of a song
At the end of a song
There's no one
After the last note is played
Only the memory stays
Then even that fades away
And there's nothing so hard
As convincing your heart
That you should start singing again


"Narration"
You know when I was a kid at the end of that Christmas day like Carl says
We were all tired from chasin' somebody else's bicycle
Or runnin' up and down the road or somethin'
But I remember you know one of the biggest blessings
That I can remember from Christmas time was a radio
Like all year you know radio back then you didn't hear Christmas carols on ev'ry
There wadn't ev'ry street corners there wadn't street corners
And there weren't chorial groups runnin' up and down the road
In front of your house singin' Christmas carols
And it's somethin' that we take for granted now, but when I was a kid
It was a real privilege and a treat to hear Christmas carol
And about the end of Christmas day when we were all tired
And we'd had all we could eat
I remember sittin' down and turnin' on the radio
And hearin' the Christmas carols played on the radio stations all around
That we picked up in Northeast Arkansas
And it was a real thrill if we could hear a song like this


"Silent Night"
(Silent night holy night)
Silent night holy night all is calm all is bright
Round young virgin mother and child holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night all is dark save the light
See the eastern wise men bring gifts and homage to our King
Christ the Saviour is born Jesus the Saviour is born
Silent night (holy night) all is calm all is bright
Poorest dreams from heaven afar heavenly host sing hallelujah
(Christ the Savious is born Jesus the Saviour is born)
Silent night holy night wonderous dark lend Thy light
With the angels let us sing hallelujah hail the King
Christ the Saviour is born Jesus the Saviour is born

"Orleans Parish Prison"
Well, have you seen my darkhaired girl
She was set on her love to a hungry world
They got her clothes anA the money she took
And they wrote her name in the prison books
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my darkhaired girl
She's tired and cold and you got the gold
She took from a hungry world
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my darkhaired girl
Well have seen my green eyed son
He shot a man down with a sawed off gun
And they fond him down by the Pontchartrain
Where they cuffed his arms with a big iron chain
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free me green eyed son
I heard him say as you let him away
Sorry for what he's done
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free me green eyed son
Well have you missed my brother man
He took a little money with a gun in his hand
Know the kids are hungry and the wife ain't well
And the daddy's locked up in a prison cell
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my brother man
I know it's sad but he ain't bad
He's doing the best he can
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my brother man


"Jacob Green"
Jacob Green got busted for possession
Next morning early he appeared in court
But he was sent to jail to wait to be trialed at some later date
Next morning early, there came a sad report
At the jail they took away his clothes to shame him
And to make sure Jacob Green had no pride left
They cut of all his hair today they found him hanging there
Afraid to face the day he killed himself
It happened yesterday and if you turn your head away
Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun
Not only Jacob Green, but many more you've never seen
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
Jacob's father hired a team of lawyers
Inspections and long inquiries were held
The sheriff then retired and the papers said two guards were fired
They put a brand new coat of paint on Jacob's cell
But like a tomb that looks so white and shiny
Inside you'll find corruption never seen
And somewhere out there tonight in a dirty cell without a light
There will be locked up another Jacob Green
It happened yesterday and if you turn your head away
Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun
Not only Jacob Green, but many more you've never seen
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done


"Me And Bobby Mcgee"
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin for the trains
Feelin nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
Took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin time and
Bobby clappin hands we finally sang up every song
That driver knew
Freedoms just another word for nothin left to lose
And nothin aint worth nothin but its free
Feelin good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
From the coalmines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin right beside me through everythin I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
The somewhere near salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
She was lookin for the love I hope shell find
Well I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin Bobbys body close to mine
Freedoms just another word for nothin left to lose
And nothin left was all she left to me
Feelin good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee


"Prisoner's Song"
I wish I had someone to love me someone to call me their own
I wish I had someone to live with cause I'm tired of livin' alone
I'll be carried to the new jail tomorrow leavin' my little darling all alone
With the cold prison walls all around me and my head on a pillow of stone
(Make that piano cry Larry Butler)
If I had the wings of an angel over these prison walls I would fly
I would fly to the arms of my darling and there I'd be willing to die


"Invertebraes"
Some men spend a lifetime in the hope they can devise
A chart which will an able man then someday analyze
The wretched men who stumble then somehow cannot arise
They'll pay one man to draw the charts another to declare
What secret signs are in the lines but do they really care
That one is long and one is short and one line is not there
For charts or abstract documents that cannot have a soul
They cannot tell why this man fell and that one reached his goal
Nor can they tell why some rebel and lose all self control
I think a thousand years from now as it was long ago
Two roads will be for all to see but which way will man go
Will he arise toward the skies to reach for some new plateau
Will he devise a brave new world a world thus far unknown
Will he plow under all the seeds of greed and hate he sewn
Or will he steal the very field he plants his hopes upon
As long as there are two such roads a man can look upon
As long as some men linger deep within the twilight zone
The weak will always take the road that leads to wall of stone
There should be made a stone blockade torn from the prison stone
And make a wall across all roads man should not walk upon
And let the seeds of bitter weeds grow till that road is gone
Then those who sot in higher power those who hold the might
Could then direct the hordes of men on to the way that's right
And then the men who draw the charts would also see the light


"That Silver Haired Daddy Of Mine"
In a vine covered
Shack in the mountains
Bravely fighting
The battle of time
There's a dear one
Who's wept
Through life's sorrows
It's that silver
Haired daddy of mine
If I could recall
All the heartaches
Dear ole daddy
I've caused you to bear
If I could erase
Those lines from your face
And bring back
The gold to your hair
If God would but
Grant me the power
Just to turn back
The pages of time
I would give all
I own just to put a tone
To that silver
Haired daddy of mine
If I could recall
All the heartaches
Dear ole daddy
I've caused you to bear
If I could erase
Those lines from your face
And bring back
The gold to your hair
If God would but
Grant me the power
Just to turn back
The pages of time
I would give all
I own just to put a tone
To that silver
Haired daddy of mine

"City Jail"
City jail city jail like an old scared dog I tuck my tail
Bow my head and not a careless word is said
Gotta sleep on the floor once more at city jail
Well I was hangin' round the bus station
Mindin' my own business like I always do
When I saw this waitress in this bus station cafe
And I thought I check out the action like I always do
I'd give her the bad eye and made a few choices personal comments
About what I thought mine and her possibilities could be for a team
When she called the badge on me
The badge grabbed me by the arm and he said
What are you doin' hangin' around here for
And I said for whatever's goin' around
City jail city jail
He said no what I mean is what are you doin'
Sayin' things like that to that lady
And I said what's that lady's doin' with purple hair
Well the badge said you're smart alec and I said no I ain't I'm just hungry
And he said you're actin' like a smart alec
And I said no that's how I act when I get hungry
City jail city jail
Well he put me outside in a dark corner
And before you could say hypocrite he hit me on the head
And I said oooh don't hit me on the head
I can't protect myself with the handcuffs on
Please don't hit me on the head then he hit me again he hit me again he hit me again
And I said oh oh oh oh oh please don't stand on my feet when you hit me
I break my ankles when I fall
City jail city jail
Well about that time they threw me in the wagon
And that waitress walked out with a sailor
I said hey you not you I'm talkin' to the purple people eater
Yes you lady quote you're the cause of it all unquote
Then she said to that sailor said get me away from that horrible man Harry
City jail city jail
Well as they hauled me away I said everybody have a nice evening

"Life Of A Prisoner"
He drinks a cup of coffee and way before the sun he's up and goin'
Out on a work detail cause he knows soon the morning whistle will begin to blowin'
All day out in that hot sun with no reward for any work he'll do
And then he'll come back in the evening
And dreams a lot of dreams that can't come true
This is the life of a prisoner forgotten man that's there to stay
He lives on faith and hope and courage and a few old dreams of yesterday
Well no one cares about him or it seems at way to him as time goes by
One day is like the other and every time he prays he prays to die
He's been there for so long now he wouldn't know how to talk to men outside
And though it's the life he lives for he fears the day the gates swing open wide
This is the life of a prisoner
He lives on faith and hope and courage and a few old dreams of yesterday


"Looking Back In Anger"
A cold bitter mist covers your eyes torment is raging in you
But you can't change the smallest part of all the wrongs you've done
Looking back in anger like you do
I'm not preachin' I'm just talkin' but I believe in what I say
That look of anger that you keep flashin' won't
accomplish you anything today
Reach out your hand someone will take it
Someone took mine then I saw a different view
I saw it'd take take a lot more loving
And a lot less looking back in anger like you do
You're still a victim of the pornographic past
The smutty face of evil showing through
But you can't take away the scars that you put on that face
Looking back in anger like you do
Now I ain't preachin' I'm just talkin' but I believe in what I say
That look of anger that you keep flashin' won't accomplish you anything today
Reach out your hand someone will take it
Someone took mine then I saw a different view
I saw it'd take take a lot more loving
And a lot less looking back in anger like you do


"Nobody Cared"
It all started out in Illinois with a woman that I thought was just my own
She saw a new tie and a new shirt kicked her heels and flipped her skirt
Slammed that door and left me standing all alone
They had a love nest in his new club there went my wife all over town
As I watched it I got green and with my drinkin' I got mean
Stuck a match and burned that club right to the ground
And I spent nine months in the hole lyin' there in solitaire
And nobody cared nobody cared nobody cared
There was a screw out in the hall that had me backed up to the wall
Escortin' me with a water pistol in that 36 degrees
With me shiverin' to my knees I ain't gonna forget about that water pistol
If I've been bad you think that'll make me better
If I've been a sinner you think that'll make me a saint no it ain't
Freedom come and I found him made him take off
All his clothes and socks and shoes
Had him scramblin' on the floor tryin' to make it to the door
Cryin' crawlin' screamin' bloody murder too
Well I didn't really kill him though over his whole world there hung a paw
I made him bend over on his knees and to his screams of Owen please
Took my turpentine water pistol and I let him have it all
Cause I spent nine months
And nobody cared nobody cared nobody cared


"Help Me Make It Through The Night"
Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
till the early morning light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care what's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord, tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
I don't care what's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord, tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
Lord, it's bad to be alone
Help me make it through the night


"Help Me Make It Through The Night"
Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
till the early morning light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care what's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord, tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
I don't care what's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord, tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
Lord, it's bad to be alone
Help me make it through the night


"I Saw A Man"
Last night I dreamed an angel came
He took my hand, he called my name
He bid me look the other way
I saw a man, I heard him say
He said if I be lifted up
I'll draw all men to me
He turned and then I saw
the nail
that bled for me
I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there
My life my heart I gave
my soul was in his care
When I awoke my heart beat so and in the dark I saw a glow
This was no dream he turned my way
Again I heard my Saviour say
He said if I be lifted up
I'll draw all men to me
He turned and then I saw
the nail
that bled for me
I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there

"Any Old Wind That Blows"
Lord, she's restless
Like cotton candy clouds that sail the day
Slow an' free
And she possesses
A mind that can't resign itself to stay
For long with me
Tho' I've tried and tried to keep her tied and satisfied
Until she really needs me
Yes I do
But when that certain look comes on her face
I can't replace it, and she leaves me
She's a butterfly in mid July
Who just can't wait to try her brand new wings
On brand new things
And she needs no rhyme or reason, when she goes
Her mind is on what lies beyond that wall of blue horizon
I suppose
And heaven knows
She'll go sailin' off on any old wind that blows
Yes she will, yes she will
She'll go sailin' off on any old wind that blows
I know she needs me
About as much as I need someone else
Which I don't
And if need be
I swear someday I'll up and leave myself
Which I won't
Even if she loved another man, I'd understand it more than I do
Mmm, mmm, mmm
But I know the only reason
That she ever had for leavin', is she wants to


"Kentucky Straight"
Up in kentucky they make a whiskey
They call a kentucky straight whiskey
And up in kentucky I married a woman
That I bet she is a better woman
Than that whiskey is whiskey
I call her my kentucky straight
I've rambled round the country side
I've drifted near and far
I've been off to seek my fortune
I've been followin' every star
I've rode the devil's highway
The hell bound interstate
But now I'm back at happy shack
With my kentucky straight
And we rise up every morning with the chicken
And every minute we're alive we're livin'
She's a little bit old fashioned but her lovin's up to date
And I'm happy here with my kentucky straight
I had looked for satisfaction in the arms of quite a few
And I've done everything that I was big enough to do
But everywhere I see her face from maine to golden gate
And I knew that this is where it's at with my kentucky straight
And we rise up every morning with the chicken
And every minute we're alive we're livin'
I love her so she knows that it was worth a while to wait
Cause I'm happy here with my kentucky straight


"The Loving Gift"
You gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
You gave me a song I learned to sing
You showed me some beauty through the windows of your soul
And you showed me a world I've never seen
Each giving to the other love and givin' it away
We spent the precious time we knew was borrowed
Cause you gave me the courage to live with yesterday
And you gave me tomorrow
You brought me a candle to light my way to bed
You erased those shadows I'd been seeing
You brought me a pillow to rest my weary head
You taught me a gentle way of dreaming
And even if you leave me I'll be richer when you go
I'm richer with the loving gift you gave me
Cause you gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
And you gave me a baby


"The Good Earth"
The good earth swallows up the seed and swallows life as well
From long before the day you're born till heaven comes or hell
It binds your hands with chains of clay that are so hard to break
But when I left good earth behind I made a big mistake
I've traveled far and traveled wide
I've seen a lot of things
But looking back on all the years
I don't know what they mean
Like steel I'm probably stronger
From going through the fire
I kept on climbin' lower
Diggin' deeper to get higher
I turned around one evening when the sun was going down
I heard the Bible told a preacher who just pulled into town
At last I'm back on good earth where I should have always been
Lord forgive me if I ever try to leave good earth again
Well the good earth was my mama and my daddy too
Now I'm working my hands in soil tryin' to pay my due
And when I'll breathe my last breath which may not be too long
Just shovel a little good earth over my head
Til everybody open up the hymn book and sing a happy song
Shall we gather at the river in the sweet by and by
Just as I am Jesus loves me one of these days I'll fly
I'm standing on the promises Lord build the place for me
In the good earth over Jordan by the Sea of Galilee mhm


"Best Friend"
Hmm an old man on his deathbed once said to me
You are the master of your destiny
A diamond is a diamond and a stone is a stone
But a man's not all good nor all bad
When the chips're all down and your back's at the wall
You're the best friend that you've ever had
You're the best friend that you've ever had
So you laugh when it's time to laugh and you cry when it's time to cry
Live while it's time to live cause you'll die when it's time to die hmm
Then he closed his eyes and he left me alone
This old man's wisdom brought his meaning home
A diamond is a diamond
Well now that I'm older I found this is true
The thing that remains is the good that you do
A diamond is a diamond and a stone is a stone
But a man's not all good nor all bad
When the chips are all down and your back's at the wall
God is the best friend that you've ever had
God is the best friend that you've ever had
So you laugh when it's time


"Oney"
I dedicate this song to the workin' man
For ever' man that puts in
Eight or ten hard hours a day of work and toil and sweat
Always got somebody lookin' down his neck
Tryin' to get more out of 'im
Than he really ought to have to put in
After twenty
In this shop with Oney standin' over me
Today when that old whistle blows
I'll check in all my gear and I'll retire
The superintendent just dropped by and said
They'd planned my little get together
Then he said I'd never a made it
If old Oney hadn't held me to the fire
I've seen him in my dreams at night
And woke up in the mornin' feelin' tired
And old Oney don't remember, when I came here
How he tried to get me fired
With his folded hands behind him
Every mornin' Oney waited at the gate
Where he'd rant and rave like I committed murder
Clockin' in five minutes late
But today they'll gather 'round me
Like I've seen 'em do when any man retires
Then old Oney's gonna tell me
From now on I'm free to do what I desire
He'll present me with that little old gold watch
They give a man at times like this
But there's one thing he's not countin' on
Today's the day I give old Oney his
I've been workin', buildin' muscles
Oney's just been standin' 'round a gettin' soft
And today about four
I'll make up for every good night's sleep I've lost
When I'm gone I'll be remembered
As the workin' man who put his point across
With a right hand full of knuckles
Cause today I show old Oney who's the boss
Hmmmm
Hey, Oney
Oney


"The Ballad Of Annie Palmer"
On the island of Jamaica
Quit a long long time ago
At rose hall plantation
Where the ocean breezes blow
Lived a girl named Annie Palmer
The mistress of the place
And the slaves all lived in fear
To see a frown on Annie's face
Wheres your husband Annie
Where's number two and three
Are they sleeping beneath the palms
Beside the Caribbean sea
At night I hear you riding
And I hear your lovers call
And I still can feel your presence
Around the great house at rose hall
Well if you should ever go to see the great house at rose hall
There's expensive chairs and china
And great paintings on the wall
They'll show you any sitting room
And the whipping post outside
But they won't let you see the room
Where Annie's husbands died
Wheres your husband Annie
Where's number two and three
Are they sleeping beneath the palms
Beside the Caribbean Sea
At night I hear you riding
And I hear your lovers call
And I still can feel your presence
Around the great house at rose hall


"Too Little Too Late"
So you're feeling numb about me being gone
So you see now you're half alive when you're alone
Well I just hope the pain will ease a little as you wait
You gave me love but too little too late
Dark days're coming now you see
Hard times for you as well as me
All time load is coming under your front gate
You gave me love but too little too late
So you got plans about some fine affair
Well think about it a little while while you're lying there
Love long and hard and don't make your lover wait
You gave me love but too little too late
Dark days're coming now you see
Hard times for you as well as me
All time load is coming under your front gate
You gave me love but too little too late
You gave me love but too little too late


"If I Had A Hammer"
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
If I had a hammer
I'd hammer in the morning
I'd hammer in the evening
All over this land
I'd hammer out danger
I'd hammer out a warning
I'd hammer out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land
If I had a bell
I'd ring it in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening
All over this land
I'd ring out danger
I'd ring out a warning
I'd ring out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land
If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning
I'd sing it in the evening
All over this land
I'd sing out danger
I'd sing out a warning
I'd sing out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land
Well I've got a hammer
And I've got a bell
And I've got a song to sing
All over this land
It's the hammer of justice
It's the bell of freedom
It's the song about love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land


"Country Trash"
I got a crib full of corn and a turnin' plow
But the ground's too wet for the hopper now
Got a cultivator and a doubletree
[1]
A leather line for the haw and gee
[2]
Let the thunder roll and the lightin' flash
I'm doin' alright for country trash
I'm saving up dimes for a rainy day
I got about a dollar laid away
The wind's from the south and the fishing's good
Got a potbelly stove a cord
Mama turns the left
I'm doin' alright for country trash
I got a mackinaw
[3]
and a huntin' dog
A cap I ordered from the catalog
A big tall tree that shades the yard
A big fat sow for the winter's lard
Let the thunder roll and the lightin' flash
I'm doin' alright for country trash
Well there's not much new ground left to plow
And crops need fertilizin' now
My hands don't earn me too much gold
For security when I grow old
But we'll all be equal under the grass
And God's got a heaven for country trash
And God's got a heaven for country trash
I'll be doin' alright for country trash
[A doubletree is a crossbar on a wagon or carriage to which two whiffletrees are attached for harnessing two animals abreast.]

"Welcome Back Jesus"

Welcome back Jesus welcome back Jesus


"The Color Of Love"
Well I used think the color of love would be a
Rosy red or a pretty pink And I thought it would
Be a thirsty man crawlin' home to get a big old
Drink And I thought love was spelled like a bell
double L bell that you ring Stead of wham bam
Hit your man with a pan Hit him on the head hear
The birdies sing
Oh you heart breakin' love makin' cut
Me
Shiftin' flour siftin' nose liftin' rose of woman
Kind Just keep on doin' what you're doin' what
You're doin' suits me just fine And love I tell
You somethin' else you blow my mind
Well I used to think the color of love would be a
Soft green like a pea in a pod And I thought love
Would strike like a light flashin' down a big old
Lightnin' rod And I thought love was spelled
double L well that would never run dry Stead
Of choke choke I'm so broke and dry I can't afford
A little bitty tear to cry
Oh you money turnin' egg churnin' butter burnin'
Baby of mine You half crazy lean and lazy pretty

Doin'... You blow my mind you blow my mind you
Blow my mind you blow my mind


"Saturday Night In Hickman"
When the sun goes down in Nashville go out that Memphis highway
Between Centerville and Dickson on the gravel roads and byways
They'll be runnin' off the shine that will be bringin' in the bounty
Saturday night in Hickman County
At the beer joint on the black top country music's playin' steady
And the workin' men are drinkin' and they're rough and they are ready
And the girl behind the counter who has all the boys a buzzin'
Will be leavin' with her husband Saturday night in Hickman County
Down upon the Piney River parked beside the pretty water
In the backseat of a Chevy is your next door neighbor's daughter
They have split up into pairs the four that went off datin' double
Gettin' that po' girl into trouble Saturday night in Hickman County
All the farmers in the valley will be sittin' by the fire
Watch the late news on the TV then they'll quietly retire
Thankful just to be a livin' thankful that tomorrow's Sunday
Sorry that the next day's Monday Saturday night in Hickman County
Saturday night in Hickman County


"Allegheny"
How she got that junk car runnin' guess I'll never know
It never ran but once and set to winters in the snow
Well imagine runnin' out on me when I lay sound asleep Allegheny
Well my big mistake was thinkin' she was something I could keep
She stole my winter's food supply and something else I fear
My savin's in the mattress have strangely disappeared
Now those who know me best knows he who robs me best beware Allegheny
I'm gonna call up the dogs and hunt you down drag you back here by the hair
Oh Allegheny something tells me you're dis
Well could it be because I've been your mail
There's a half of you that's French yeah and I need to crave a better style
And a half of you is Cherokee yeah and I've gone wild Allegheny
She's got a head start on me as a crow flies half a day
And unless I miss my guess she'll stop to rest in Monterey
But if I take the Knoxville Highway thirteen hours it will be Allegheny
Well she forgot I knew the shortcut I'll be there in less than three
Oh Allegheny something tells me
I signaled for my dogs to wait outside the hotel door
I described her to the desk clerk he said try the second floor
And then he mentioned she's got company
And that marks the stranget's doom Allegheny
I wish I was her so I could see my face when I bust into the room
Oh Allegheny something tells me
Allegheny Allegheny come back here Allegheny Allegheny


"Life Has Its Little Ups And Downs"
I don't know how to tell her I didn't get that raise in pay today
(That's all right John)
Cause I know how much she wanted that dress in Baker's window
And it breaks my heart to tell her she'll have to wait
And cancel all the plans we made to celebrate
But I just know that she can take it with a smile and not a frown
Cause she knows life has its little ups and downs like ponies on a merry
And no one grabs a brass ring every time but she don't mind (I don't mind)
She wears a gold ring on her finger and it's mine
Those new house plans we've had so long I guess will gather dust another year
And the daffodils are bloomin' that she planted way last fall upon the hill
And over by the gate God knows I hate to say again we'll have to wait
But I just know that she can take it with a smile and not a frown
Cause she knows life has its little ups and downs like ponies on a merry
And no one grabs a brass ring every time but she don't mind (No I don't mind)
She wears a gold ring on her finger and it's mine
She wears a gold ring on her finger and it's mine


"Matthew 24 (Is Knocking At The Door)"
I heard on the radio there's rumors of war
People getting ready for battle
And there may be just one more
I heard about an earthquake
And the toll it took away
These are the signs of the times we're in today
Matthew twenty
And there can't be too much more to come to pass
Matthew twenty
And a day or one more could be the last
A great bear from the northland has risen from his sleep
And the Army ranks in red are near two hundred million deep
The young and old now prophesy a coming
Prince of Peace
And last night I dreamed of lightning in the east
Matthew twenty
And there can't be too much more to come to pass
Matthew twenty
And a day or one more could be the last


"City Of New Orleans"
Ridin' on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday mornin' rail
15 cars and 15 restless riders
Three conductors, 25 sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey the train pulls out of Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' graves that have no name, freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of rusted automobiles
Good mornin' America, how are you
Don't you know me
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done
Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels grumblin' neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep, rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel
Good mornin' America, how are you
Don't you know me
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done
Night time on the City of New Orleans
Changin' cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Halfway home, we'll be there by mornin'
Thru the Mississippi darkness rollin' down to the sea
But all the towns
people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his song again
The passengers will please refrain
This train has got the disappearin railroad blues
[Repeat Chorus]


"Tony"
This is the story of Tweedle
And a cowboy that I knew named Tony
From Blithe Fresno ol' Sant Joe Washoe go rodeo
Pendleton Santa Ana Baker Bozeman and Burley
From Chambers to Payson Rapid City to Akron
We'd sing just to ease all the hurts that we gained
A bandage to wrap the aches and a few turns of tape
Held us together and stopped the blood stains
Well sometimes we'd draw bad and the stock wouldn't buck
And there was times when the luck wasn't goin' our way
But a credit card that I'd found would get us to the next town
With just a switch of his Montana plates
I remember at Evanston when a bull broke his arm
And we had to make it on into Beulah the next day
I broke out the CB and the only doctor Tony seen
Was me and a can of ether
There in the Beulah shoot gates
And it was at Louisville that I went down in the well
And a suicide wrap I held in my hand
The clown just shook his boom while I dangled near doom
It was Tony that saved my life then
Then a year from that week we pulled up at Mesquite
Where I drew number twelve from the herd
And Tony my side kick pulled Tweedle
That bull's famous from Prairie to Evansburg
All right now cowboys kinda clear the way
Let that ambulance through there let that ambulance on through
Looks like a pretty bad wreck out there folks
Hold up folks we go one more ride left down there in the shoots
Wait a minute it looks like they're turnin' ole number twelve out
So that's all for today folks
I'll finish the story of Tweedle
And the cowboy that I knew named Tony
From Sterling to Abilene Loveland to New Orleans
I've got a new partner travelin' with me
But I never could explain why I called him the wrong name
When I get drunk I call him Tony
And sometimes he'll ask me why I pass Montana by
You know at Butte they got money
But that's where I met him my side kickin' friend
I've got more than enough of his memories
For down in Mesquite there's a cowboy sleeping
Where bulls ain't a buckin' ain't a buckin' ole Tony


"The Pine Tree"
I lean my back against you thinkin' you were an oak
I knew the wind could bent you but I can't believe you broke
Now the wind could never break me only your false love
Honey I've been true I swear by God above
I thought you were a willow but you never wept for me
You went roamin' in the wildwood like a ship that roams the see
The willow tree is fickle and it weeps in the morning dew
My love is a pine tree cause that's the only tree that's true
If I was mistaken then take my eyes away
You made a bed in the wildwood and that's where I saw you lay
Honey your eyes deceived you it's true I touched the ground
But I never slept there I never let my long hair down mhm
Love is like a thorn bush touch it and you will find
You'll prick your fingers and leave the sweetest flower behind
Love oh love oh what you done to me
You set me a driftin' like a ship upon the sea
Yes a ship there is I see you and you belong to me
My love is the ocean and deeper love cannot be
Yeah well I guess I was mistaken and woman I want you back
You never have left my heart now honey baby that's a fact
Come to me pine tree and we will never part
We'll put our roots down in each other's heart
Come to me pine tree


"We're For Love"
I'm for you I'm for you I'm for anything that starts with us
You're for me you're for me that makes both of us for love
And if we're for each other we won't be bothered
By how much the world may push and shove
It makes no difference who stands against us
As long as you and I are both for love
I'm woman all over when you're around me honey I can't seem to get enough
Let's stay together like this forever and show the world that we're for love
And if we're for each other
As you and I are both for love


"Godshine"
Well a light from the sun comes shinin'
Oh happy day oh happy day
And then along come a big old moon to light my way
And then the stars kinda twinkle and they light this path of mine
And mine
I can't see a thing in his world without a little Godshine
Well Jesus is the beam on the left of me
Comin' right through the shadow on the right
Lord all the dark corners within my soul need you fire day and night
Well the sun and the moon and the stars wouldn't even hold a candle in my life
I'm in the dark when the sun is high
I need just a little bit of Godshine
Well Jesus died and there's a lot of folks feel regret
But on the other hand there are people that are laughin' yet
Laughin' about a man that lived and died divine
He could have lived on but he wouldn't stop spreadin' that Godshine
Well Jesus is the beam on the left of me
Comin' right through the shadow on the right
Lord all the dark corners within my soul need you fire day and night
Well the sun and the moon and the stars wouldn't even hold a candle in my life
I'm in the dark when the sun is high
I need just a little bit of Godshine
Well Jesus is the beam on the left of me
Comin' right through the shadow on the right
Lord all the dark corners within my soul need you fire day and night
Well the sun and the moon and the stars wouldn't even hold a candle in my life
I'm in the dark when the sun is high
I need just a little bit of Godshine
I'm in the dark when the sun is high I need just a little bit of Godshine


"Ragged Old Flag"
I walked through a county courthouse square
On a park bench, an old man was sittin' there
I said
Your old court house is kinda run down
He said
Naw, it'll do for our little town
I said
Your old flag pole is leaned a little bit
And that's a ragged old flag you got hangin' on it
He said
Have a seat
and I sat down
Is this the first time you've been to our little town
I said
I think it is
He said
I don't like to brag, but we're kinda proud of
That Ragged Old Flag
You see, we got a little hole in that flag there
When Washington took it across the Delaware
and It got powder burned the night Francis Scott Key sat watching it
writing
Say Can You See
It got a rip in New Orleans, with Packingham
Jackson
tugging at its seams
and It almost fell at the Alamo
beside the Texas flag
But she waved on though
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill
There was Robert E. Lee and Beauregard and Bragg
And the south wind blew hard on
That Ragged Old Flag
On Flanders Field in World War I
She got a big hole from a Bertha Gun
She turned blood red in World War II
She hung limp, and low, a time or two
She was in Korea, Vietnam, She went where she was sent
by her Uncle Sam
She waved from our ships upon the briny foam
and now they've about quit wavin' back here at home
in her own good land here She's been abused
She's been burned, dishonored, denied an' refused
And the government for which she stands
Has been scandalized throughout out the land
And she's getting thread bare, and she's wearin' thin
But she's in good shape, for the shape she's in
Cause she's been through the fire before
and i believe she can take a whole lot more
So we raise her up every morning
And we bring her down slow every night
We don't let her touch the ground
And we fold her up right
On second thought
do
Cause I'm mighty proud of
That Ragged Old Flag


"Don't Go Near The Water"
Your mama used to worry about that big muddy river
Honey do your remember
You let the screen door slam when you stepped off the front porch
Then your mama calling don't be late
And I'd hear your daddy holler
Son she's my only daughter
You'd stick your nose in the honeysuckle down by the gate
I could still hear your mama calling
don't go near the water
We fell right in
Went over our head
But we didn't go near the water
Nothing beats the young and sweet
And the nights got hotter and hotter
We were sure enough getting our feet wet mama
But we didn't go near the water
We'd hear the rocking chair squeaking
As you sneaked up the back stairs
Mama waiting like a grizzly bear
Had to get the honeysuckle out of your hair
But in the morning light
You'd look her right in the eye
It wasn't a lie
We didn't go near the water
We fell right in
Went over our head
But we didn't go near the water
Nothing beats the young and sweet
And the nights got hotter and hotter
We were sure enough getting our feet wet mama
But we didn't go near the water
Your mama used to worry about that big muddy river
She should've worried about me
Cause we were sure enough getting our feet wet mama
But we didn't go near the water
Didn't go near the water
Didn't go near the water yeah
Boom Chicka Boom


"All I Do Is Drive"
Well, I asked an old truck driver
About life out on the road
If he does a lotta singing
When he's bringing in his load
If there's a pretty waitress crying for him
Every hundred miles
If he gets a lotta loving
If he has a lot of smiles
And I asked him if those trucking songs
Tell about a life like his
He said, if you want to know the truth about it
Here's the way it is
All I do is drive, drive, drive
Try to stay alive
And keep my mind on my load
Keep my eye upon the road
I got nothin' in common with any man
Who's home every day at five
All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive
Well, we shared a cup of coffee
Then I had to warm it up
And his greasy fingers trembled
As he held onto the cup
And I said, don't you hear a lot of music
See a lot of sights
But if you'll tune into the Grand Ole Opry
Saturday night
I will dedicate you a trucking song
To which you can relate
He said, you just do the singing
And I'll do the driving mate
All I do is drive, drive, drive
Try to stay alive
And keep my mind on my load
Keep my eye upon the road
I got nothin' in common with any man
Who's home every day at five
All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive
If I can get the fuel

"Southern Comfort"
I've been a thrill seeking rambler
And often came into this town
But the thrills were too high for my little sky
So I dug in and I've settled down
And I got a good job in Nashville
No way they can pay me enough
For grindin' up tobacco leaves
Making brut and snuff
Southern comfort is killin' me
I'm slowly chokin' in Tennessee
I shovel the snuff until late afternoon
Then I crawl with the traffic and I choke on its fumes
And fall on the face when I get to my room
Southern comfort is killin' me
I met a woman in Nashville
For a while we were carryin' on
She'd washed snuff out of my shirts every night
And keep me with clean ones on
But I guess she got tired of tobacco
At least of the regular kind
Now I'm still workin' where nicotine
And memories are burnin' in my mind
And Southern comfort is killin' me
The Cumberland cannot enhermit each bee
I'm sniffin' and dippin' and livin' alone
I smell funny smoke and I know where she's gone
She's in some other county now proving her own
Southern comfort is killin' me
Southern comfort is killin' me


"King Of The Hill"
If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill
If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill
Get put on at the Harlan mine
Be the last one out at quittin' time
You already workin' when the whistle blew
Never complain about a job to do
When they say who can, you say I will
If you ever gonna be king of the hill
If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill
You need a good woman to share your bed
To keep you loved and to keep you fed
To help you to face another day
To get you up and on your way
Where the golden rule don't rule out true
You do to them before they do to you
Watch out for yourself or nobody will
If you ever gonna be king of the hill
If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill
Saturday night you go to Harlan town
You shoot some pool and you fool around
You watch the girls and you drink bootleg
Get starved to death before you beg
You trust in luck till your luck is gone
Then jump right in and you hang right on
There may be times you would have to kill
If you ever gonna be king of the hill
If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill
When the last of the coals out of every vein
Had long been gone on the northbound train
Walk up to the top and if you're standing still
You can call yourself king of the hill
But if you fall like a lot have done
By accident or knife or gun
When they lay you high on the mountain still
You can call yourself king of the hill
If you gonna be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill


"Pie In The Sky"
From the day of your birth
It's bread and water here on earth
To a child of light, to a child of light
But there'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright
There'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright
Sometimes I doubt in fear
That I've really gained salvation here
For it's out of sight, for it's out of sight
But there'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright
He said if I do His will
There's a promise He'd fulfill
And He's gone now to prepare
Me a mansion out there
And there'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright
There'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright
There'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright
There'll be pie in the sky


"Lonesome To The Bone"
On the park bench I slept on
Raindrops are fallin' on the newspapers coverin' me
I hear early mornin' motors
And I know the world is wakin' for the dawn
But my mind's down a dark alley
Somewhere where last night you loved me
And in the early mornin' chill my arms remember still
But I'm droppin' like a stone lonesome to the bone
The sun is roughly risin' on the roofs of Stagger town
The time for sweat and poison out is just now comin' 'round
The high time of last midnight is over with and gone
Leavin' me to be lonesome to the bone
I walked away the wind blows
And any way the wind goes will be good enough for me
The streets are loud and crowded
But I walk my weary way lost and alone
Your hot breath and your laughter
Keep flashin' through my mind to warm me
But the naked light of day soon makes it fade away
And I'm droppin' like a stone lonesome to the bone
The sun is roughly risin' on the roofs of Stagger town
The time for sweat and poison out is just now comin' 'round
The high time of last midnight is over with and gone
Leavin' me to be lonesome to the bone

"While I've Got It On My Mind"
Layin' 'round home with a ball game on
Feelin' fairly fine
Blackberry jam is cookin' in the pan
And the jam and the cook are mine
I like my honey from the hives of home
And berries from my old vine
And I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind
My dog is asleep at my bare feet
It's a good day for layin' around
Just her and me and it's Saturday
Everybody's gone to town
We've been workin' hard and she gets tired
That puts me in a bind
Coz I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind
Then she looks at me and I can see
That old familiar look
And the jam is sweet as she lowers the heat
To give it time to cook
Then I lock the door and across the floor
To my queen of woman kind
Yeah, I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind
Now boys don't you be ramble and free
And leavin' the girls to cry
Coz the nights get cold and there ain't no gold
That'll ever satisfy
And there ain't no joy that'll come to you boys
Like the kind I've known at times
When I go right on in that lover
While I got in on my mind
Yeah, I like to get my lovin'
While I got in on my mind


"Good Morning, Friend"
He's not on some golden throne way off and out of space
He's not hidin' out in some big secret hidin' place
I can guarantee he'll be your friend to touch and hold
And I'm qualified to tell it cause I've got it in control
Good morning friend good morning friend
Every day's a brand new morning since the morning you will din
Good morning friend good morning friend
Yes I'm feeling like a million since I've got you livin' in
He'll stand and knock upon your door do you let him inside
He'll be a constant comforter and keep you satisfied
He will make himself avaliable no matter who you are
He'll light your darkest night and be your bright and morning star
Good morning friend good morning friend
Yes I'm feeling like a million since the morning you moved in
Good morning friend good morning friend
Ask me how I feel this morning and I'm proud to say again
Good morning friend good morning friend
Yes I'm feeling like a million since I've got you livin' in


"I'm A Worried Man"
(Worried man,) (Papa is a worried man.)
(Worried man,) (Papa is a worried man.)
The place I go to draw my pay
Closed the door on me today
Told me just to stay away
And don't come back again
Ahh: I told my Mama
Baby, don't you cry
I'll get a job before the day go by
I don't know where, and that is why
I'm a worried man. (Worried.)
Worried man, a worried man
(Worried.) (Worried.)
I'm a very worried man
Hungry babies don't understand
And their Papa is a worried man
Papa is a worried man. (Play it, Johnny,) (Yeah.)
There is no way that I can see
That I can feed my family, (That's sad.)
I don't own a money tree
An' I don't own no land
Now listen: I've got muscle and I've got brains
I don't mind the sun an' the rain
I gotta make a little change
As I'm a worried, worried, worried man, ooh. (Worried.)
Worried man, a worried man
(Worried.) (Worried.)
I'm a very worried man. (Worried man.)
Hungry babies don't understand
And their Papa is a worried man
Their Papa is a worried man. (Take it: take it.)
(That's it, (That's it, that's it, that's it.)
(Ok, do it: go Willie.)
(Worried man, worried man.)
(Papa is a worried man.)
(Worried man, worried man.)


"Please Don't Let Me Out"
I've been in jail eleven years and parole has just come through
The gates will soon swing open wide but I'm not going through
Jail's the only home I know or care to know about
Please let me stay where I belong please don't let me out
How could I tell those friends of mine they've seen the last of me
Can't I make you understand I never can be free
Cause that's a big unfriendly world and I don't know the route
That leads to where I may belong please don't let me out
I had to learn to get along without a lot of things
And I had to learn to live with the loneliness confinement brings
And I learnt to take no mail from home or whatever came about
Now I'm dug in and I'm happy here please don't let me out
How could I tell those friends of mine
Yes that's a big unfriendly world


"What On Earth (Will You Do For Heaven's Sake)"
Did you walk another mile, turn a frown with a smile
Did you lift the lowly heart about to break
Would you also give your cloak to one who took away your coat
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake
Did you feed the poor in spirit and befriend the prosecuted
Will you show the bounds that all the chains can break
Did you sow the proper seed
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake
Will you be one of the meek, did you turn the other cheek
Would you give a little more than you would take
Did you shine your little light upon the children of the night
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake
Did you feed the poor in spirit and befriend the prosecuted
Will you show the bounds that all the chains can break
Did you sow the proper seed
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake


"My Old Kentucky Home (Turpentine And Dandelion Wine)"
Turpentine and dandelion wine
I've turned the corner, an' I'm doin' fine
Shootin' at the birds on the telephone line
Pickin' 'em off with this gun o' mine
Got a fire in my belly and a fire in my head
Going higher and higher 'til I'm dead
Sister Sue is short and stout
She didn't grow up, she grew out
Momma says she's plain, but she's just being kind
Papa thinks she's pretty, but he's almost blind
Don't let her out much except at night
But I don't care 'cause I'm all right
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Young folks roll on the floor
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Keep them hard times away from my door
Brother Gene is big and mean
And he don't have much to say
He had a little woman who he whooped each day
But now she's gone away
Got drunk last night, kicked momma down the stairs
But I'm all right, so I don't care
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
And the young folks are rollin' on the floor
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Keep them hard times away from my door
Turpentine and dandelion wine
I've turned the corner, an' I'm doin' fine
Shootin' at the birds on the telephone line
Pickin' 'em off with this gun o' mine
Got a fire in my belly and a fire in my head
Goin' higher and higher 'till I'm dead
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home

Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Keep them hard times away from my door
Keep them hard times away from my door


"Hard Times Comin'"
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times, come again no more
Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times, come again no more
Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more
There's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
With a worn heart, whose better days are o'er
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day
Oh, hard times, come again no more
Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more
Tis the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more


"The Lady Came From Baltimore"
The lady came from Baltimore and all she wore was lace
She didn't know that I was poor, she never saw my place
I was there to steal her money, to take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none
The lady's name was Susan Moore, her daddy read the law
She didn't know that I was poor, and lived outside the law
Her daddy said I was a thief and didn't marry her for love
But I was Susan's true belief, and I married her for love
I was there to steal her money, to take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none
The house she lived in had a wall to keep the robbers out
She never stopped to think at all, that that's what I'm about
I was there to steal her money, to take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none
Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none

"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"
Virgil Caine is the name, and I served on the Danville Train
Til stonemans cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of 65, we were hungry, just barely alive
By may the tenth, richmond had fell, its a time I remember, oh so well
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the people were singin. they went
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Back with my wife in Tennessee, when one day she called to me
Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E. Lee
Now I dont mind choppin wood, and I dont care if the moneys no good
Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the people were singin. they went
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Like my father before me, I will work the land
Like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave, but a yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet
You cant raise a caine back up when hes in defeat


"Clean Your Own Tables"
Well now she ain't exactly what you'd call your all American girl
And some too many truckers took her home
And I'll admid her life would read just like a paperback
And some of what she's done I've said it's wrong
But I said clean your own tables boys and bring out your beer
Cause she ain't gonna do it this time
And drink to a use to be barmaid cause she's a lady I choose to be mine
And I ain't exactly been what you call your all American boy
I've done my time in Frisco in LA
How some of youth are taking pride in what I am
I heard you cussing this decision that I've made
But I said clean your own tables
And I'll admid her life would read just like a paperback
And some of what she's done well I say is wrong
But I said clean your own tables
Boys if you're able clean your own tables and let me take care of mine


"Jesus Was Our Saviour And Cotton Was Our King"
Wagon wheels are turning with cobble colored sound
When me and little Tommy rode the first load in the town
The cotton gin was ginning out the pennies for the pounds
Like a giant vacuum cleaner sucking let up off the ground
Our freckled faces sparkled then like diamonds in the rough
With smiles it smells of snaggleteeth and good old Garett snuff
If I could I would be tradin' all this fat back for the lean
When Jesus was our Saviour and cotton was our king
This kind of life we're living beats all I've ever seen
Seems some of us was born for picking things and eaten beans
Still I reckon girl or diggin' fairly well in our means
Cause Jesus was our Saviour and cotton was our king
Our freckled faces sparkled then like diamonds in the rough
With smiles it smells of snaggleteeth and good old Garett snuff
If I could I would be tradin' all this fat back for the lean
When Jesus was our Saviour and cotton was our king
Our freckled faces sparkled then like diamonds in the rough
With smiles it smells of snaggleteeth and good old Garett snuff
If I could I would be tradin' all this fat back for the lean
When Jesus was our Saviour and cotton was our king


"Reason To Believe"
If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight
Still I look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you makes it hard to live without
Somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give
Never think about myself
If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd try to leave all the past behind
Knowing that you lied straight
Still I look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you makes it easy to live without
Somebody else
Someone like you makes it hard to give
Never think about myself
If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight
Still I look to find a reason to believe
Still I look to find a reason to believe
Still I look to find a reason to believe


"Cocaine Carolina"
Morning found me lyin' on a floor in New Orleans
Looking like the patches was about to eat my jeans
Feeling like my belly was a warehouse for the blues
And I sure miss my sweet Cocaine Carolina
Met her on an oceanliner, called her Cocaine Carolina
She was quite a lady then and I was twenty two
God knows how much I adored her I just never could afford her
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you
So goodbye Cocaine Carolina you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag she knows just what to do
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you
Oh someone said if I was lucky I could go back to Kentucky
Lexington was famous for its bluegrass and its hills
Carolina we should get up, don't you know we'll have to split up
Maybe I should go to California
So goodbye Cocaine Carolina you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag she knows just what to do
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you
Oh goodbye Cocaine Carolina
Oh goodbye Cocaine Carolina


"Smokey Factory Blues"
Early in the misty misty morning headin' for another freeway jam
Sleepy eyed and shriverin' wakin' up and wishin' it was Sunday I wish it was Sunday
On the radio they're playin' love songs songs that make me wanna turn around
Factory gates are up ahead. I wished that I was home in bed
With you, right now, back home with you, right now
But I work to make a living and I work without a break
And I work when I am sleeping and I work when I'm awake
Yes and I'd like to leave the city but I can't afford to move
And I think I'm going under with them way down lowdown smokey factory blues
I was born a lover not a worker
Money doesn't smell like sweet perfume
Some of us feel out of place
Believe me you better believe me
But I work to make a living and I work without a break
And I work when I am sleeping and I work when I'm awake
Yes and I'd like to leave the city but I can't afford to move
And I think I'm going under with them way down, lowdown smokey factory blues
Yes. I work to make a living and I work without a break
And I work when I am sleeping and I work when I'm awake
Yes and I'd like to leave the city but I can't afford to move. (Fade)


"Texas, 1947"
Bein' six years old I had seen some trains before
So it's hard to figure out what I'm at the depot for
Trains're big and black and smokin' steam screamin' at the wheels
Bigger'n anything there is least that's the way she feels
Trains're big and black and smokin' louder'n July 4th
But everybody's actin' like this might be something more
Than just pickin' up the mail or the soldiers from the war
Somethin' even old man Wyman's never seen before
And it's late afternoon on a hot Texas day
Somethin' strange was goin' on and we's all in the way
There are fifty or sixty people just settin' on their cars
And the ole men left their dominoes and come down from the bars
And everybody's checkin' old Jack Kittrell checks his watch
And us kids put our ears to the rails to hear 'em pop
So we already knowed it when they finally said train time
You'd have thought that Judgement Day was rollin' down the line
Cause things got real quiet and mama jerked me back
But not before I get the chance to lay a nickel on the track
Look out here she comes she's comin' look out there she goes she's gone
Screamin' straight through Texas like a mad dog cyclone
Big and red and silver she don't lay no smoke
She's a fast rollin' streamline come to show the folks
I said look out here she comes she's comin' look out there she goes she's gone
Screamin' straight through Texas like a mad dog cyclone
Lord she never even stopped
She left fifty or sixty people still settin' on their cars
Wonderin' what it's comin' to and how it got this far
And me I got a nickel smashed flatter than a dime
By a mad dog runaway red silver streamline train
Look out here she comes she's comin' look out there she goes she's gone
Screamin' straight through Texas like a mad dog cyclone
Big and red and silver she don't lay no smoke
She's a fast rollin' streamline come to show the folks
I said look out here she comes she's comin' look out there she goes she's gone
Screamin' straight through Texas like a mad dog cyclone


"What Have You Got Planned Tonight Diana"
It all started in 1929 me and Diana had gone to Alaska
To homestead some of that free government land
Forty miles from the nearest gravel road we cut our
life in the ponderosa pines
We sweated hard to beat the winter snow
But the cabin's up and we've got lots of times
What have you got planned tonight Diana would you consider
laying in my arms
I love you more than ever now Diana I'm sure you're the reason I was born
Jim was born the first year we were here look at him
Diana he's almost grown
And the baby's in the cradle fast asleep just think
in no time they'll be up and gone
What have you got planned
Well time sure does fly by doesn't it Diana
It's been almost two years now since you've been gone
Think children grew up so fast
But I guess they deserve to see the world now don't they
But you know Diana remembering how you loved me
And how much I love you I don't feel so alone
What have you got planned
What have you got planned


"Look At Them Beans"
This time last year there sure was
A lot of sad faces around this old house
Our papa died without fulfillin' his life's dream
Of producing one of the best crops in Grimes County
Though papa died with that dream still in his head
A desire in his heart, a promise on his lips, calluses on both hands
And two dollars in his pocket
Papa didn't live long enough to see his dreams come true
So he died from too much work, broken spirit, I guess
But I promised our mama that if it was a last thing he'd ever do
He'd live long enough to see just one good crop come through
But you see we can't plan on things without first talking to God
Because we don't know his plans
And if we don't include him my friends the way can get mighty hard
They say that every time a good and righteous person
Is buried in God's good earth it's just fertilizer for the soil
And I guess there must be some truth to that
Whether we believe it or not
I just wish that papa was here right now
So that he could see this good crop that we finally got
Hey look at that beans and look at that corn
And I bet them watermelons must be three feet long
Man look at them tomatoes and look at them peas
Well I know if papa was here right now he'd sure be pleased
And papa would sure be proud of his children too
My brother's famous now got his own show on the road
Traveling in customized bus imported from Europe
That boy always did love music and he loves to travel
I got a sister that's got a good job in a beauty shop
Making money, making other people look good
Ain't nobody here at a house now but me and mama
And mama she's gettin' weaker and she's gettin' older every day
And she talks softly about joinin' papa in his heavenly home
But that woman sure did love that man
She worked beside papa for forty some odd years
Tryin' to produce a good crop and never could grow a single bean
But I just wish that papa was here right now
To see this good crop that we finally got
Man, look at that beans and look at that corn
And I bet them watermelons must be three feet long
Man, look at them tomatoes and look at them peas
Well, I know if papa was here right now he'd sure be pleased
And papa, if you can hear me look at them beans


"No Charge"
Our little boy came up to his mama in the kitchen this evening
While she was fixing supper
And he handed her a piece of paper he'd been writin' on
And after wipin' her hands on her apron she read it and this is what it said
For mowin' the yard 5 dollars
For makin' my own bed this week 1 dollar
For going to the store 50 cents
For playin' with my little brother while you went shoppin' 25 cents
For taking out the trash 1 dollar
For gettin' a good report card 5 dollars
And for rakin' the yard 2 dollars
Total amount owed 14 dollars and 75 cents
Well as mama looked at him standin' there expectanly
And I could see the memories flashin' through her mind
And so she picked up the pen and turnin' the paper over
This is what she wrote and I read it to him
For the nine months she carried you growing inside her no charge
For the nights we sat up with you doctoring you praying for you no charge
For the time and the tears that you've caused through the years there's no charge
When you added all up the full cost of our love is no charge
For the nights filled with dread and the worries ahead no charge
For advice and for knowledge and the cost of your college no charge
For the toys food and clothes and for wiping your nose there's no charge
When you added all up the full cost of our love is no charge
Well when I finished readin' he had big tears in his eyes
And he looked up at his mother and he said mama I sure do love you
Then he took the pen and in great big letter he wrote Paid In Full
When you added all up the cost of real love is no charge


"I Hardly Ever Sing Beer Drinking Songs"
I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
And when they play them cheatin' tunes I never sing along
I never ever sing the blues I've forgotten born to lose
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
I hardly ever walk the floor and cry
And I don't think I've ever said I feel like I could die
I don't ever lay awake I never think my heart will break
I hardly ever walk the floor and cry
I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
I can't put much feeling in saying love is all gone wrong
I don't lose no sleep at night cause things with you are going right
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
I never call your name out in my sleep
You never make me worry and you never make me weep
I never wonder if you're true I spend a night curled up with you
And I never call your name out in my sleep
I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
And when they play them cheatin' tunes I never sing along
I never ever sing the blues I've forgotten born to lose
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs


"Down The Road I Go"
I guess there's not much I can do or say saw my baby with another guy today
Though I love her and I tried to tell her so it's hello blues and down the road I go
I've never seen that guy before today he held my baby in the closest way
And the way she snuggled close to him I know it's hello blues and down the road I go
Well it seems our thoughts were much alike our likes were much the same
We even had our future plan till into town he came
I've never seen that guy
Well it seems our thoughts


"I Never Met A Man Like You Before"
You shined your light so I could see that life was more than a chore
When I came up against the wall you said I am the door
You gave me reason to believe in you now I believe it even more
I've never met a man like you before
You gave me back my pride so I could wear it for all the world to see
You told me if my yesterdays were paid for tomorrow is free
From now until I die I know I won't be lonely anymore
I've never met a man like you before
And if all of my dreams turn to dust before my eyes
And all of my songs remain unsung
If all the world can offer me just emptiness and lies
I know I'll still have your perfect love
Stormy weather comes and goes some of my old friends got washed away
But you're an Island of refuge on your solid rock I found my place
If wordly riches faild me but I have you how can I be poor
I've never met a man like you before


"All Around Cowboy"
Just a broken down cowboy all down on his luck
He's been through the best of his friends
On a long lonesome highway and an old pickup truck
Crossed Texas with a hot dusty wind
He was all around cowboy 1959 from the top it's been a long way down
Since the whiskey and ladies started winning his time
They rode him high and hard to the ground
But he remembers the thrill of bein' a winner
And the feeling of bein' a beginner in the days of his first rodeo
But there was something about winning that didn't last forever
But tomorrow it's bound to get better he'll be the all around cowboy again
The windmills're turning on the west Texas plains but he's dry as an old river bed
He's just like the dust that's a searching for rain but he knows he'll be ridin' again
So he rolls up a smoke and he sips his Old Crow
Whipes the whiskers that cover his chin
He grins as he dreams of the next rodeo to be the all around cowboy again
But he remembers the thrill


"Gone"
I'm on the hill by Friscio Bay
Hawaiian winds blow my past away
There's a freighter there that is southern bound
I'm on my way out of this town
There's Alcatraz and the man that has
Bills love and pills and drink and wine and song
Stand in line and fight and wind and roam
Kids and yard and I'm a man that's tired and gone
There was a time when things were good
We had it better than we ever should
But things got hard and love got old
I got tired and love grew cold
There's Alcatraz and the man that has


"Down At Drippin' Springs"
Campers bikes and mobile homes cars and pickup trucks
Slacks and '59 hairdoes sideburns spears and ducks
There's lone star pearl and fried chicken and one big cloud of smoke
Plug it in and turn it on and the music goes for broke
Down at Drippin' Springs down at Drippin' Springs
There's Willie and Waylon Kris and Tom have you heard Gatlin sing
Down at Drippin' Springs down at Drippin' Springs
Duncan's on and Linda's next time many did Joel Gray down at Drippin' Springs
Well the Texas sun is low and hot upon the chaparral
It would be one ideal spot for God to put his hell
The most beloved cowboys songs echoe cross the plains
T Texas Tyler ain't forgotten next year y'all come again
Down at Drippin' Springs Down at Drippin' Springs
There's Russell Bush and Kris and Coe have you heard Gatlin sing
Down at Drippin' Springs down at Drippin' Springs
There's Willie and Waylon Kris and Tom have you heard Gatlin sing
Down at Drippin' Springs down at Drippin' Springs
Duncan's on and Rita's next how many did Joel Gray down at Drippin' Springs


"Precious Memories"
(Precious mem'ries)
Precious mem'ries unseen angel sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me and the sacred past unfolds
Precious mem'ries how they linger how they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight precious sacred seems unfold
Precious father loving mother fly across the lonely years
And the old home scenes from my childhood in fond memory appear
Precious mem'ries how they linger
Precious mem'ries flood my soul


"Rock Of Ages"
Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee
Let the water and the blood from Thy wounded side which fload
Thee of sin the double cure save from raft and make me pure
Let me hime myself in Thee
In my hand no prize I bring simply to Thy cross I cling
While I draw this pleading breath when my eyes shall close in death
Lord when I rise to world unknown and behold the on Thy throne
Rock of ages cleft for me let me hime myself in Thee
Let me hime myself in Thee


"The Old Rugged Cross"
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
And exchange it some day for a crown
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true
Its shame and reproach gladly bear
Then Hell call me some day to my home far away
Where His glory forever Ill share
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
And exchange it some day for a crown
And exchange it some day for a crown
Believe In Him


"Softly And Tenderly"
Softly and tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
See on the portals, he's waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me
Come home, come home
Ya who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, oh, sinner come home
Why should we teary when Jesus is pleading
Pleading for you and for me
Why should we linger and heed not his mercies
Mercies for you and for me
Come home, come home
Ya who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, oh, sinner come home
Oh, for the wonderful love he has promised
Promised for you and for me
Though we have sinn'd, he has mercy and pardon
Pardon for you and for me
Come home, come home
Ya who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, oh, sinner come home


"In The Sweet By And By"
There's a land that is fairer than day
And by faith we can see it apart
For the father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blessed
And our spirits shall sorrow no more
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
To our bountiful father above
We will offer our tribute of praise
For the glorious gift of His love
And His blessings that hallow our days
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore


"Just As I Am"
Just as I am without one plea but that Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee oh lamb of God I come I come
Just as I am and waiting not to rid my soul of one dark blot
To Thee who's blood can cleanse each spot oh lamb of God I come I come
Just as I am Lord Thou tossed about with many a conflict and many a doubt
Fightings fears within and without oh lamb of God I come I come
Just as I am Thou wilt receive will dwell come pardon cleanse relieve
Because Thy promise I believe oh lamb of God I come I come


"Farther Along"
Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong
Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
When death has come and taken our loved ones
It leaves our home so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year
Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by


"When The Roll Is Called Up Yonder"
When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
When the saved diverse shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
Let us lay before the Master from the dawn till setting sun
Let us talk of all his wonderous love and care
And when all of life is over and our work on earth is done
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder
(When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there)


"Amazing Grace"
Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed
When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we'd first begun


"At The Cross"
Alas and did saviour bleed and did my sov'reign die
Would he devote that sacred head for such a worm as I
At the cross at the cross where I first saw the light
And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day
Was it for crimes that I have done he groaned upon the tree
Amazing pity grace unknown and love beyond degree
At the cross at the cross where I first saw the light
And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day
But drops of grief cannot repay the debt of love I owe
Here lord I give myself away it's all that I can do
At the cross at the cross where I first saw the light
And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day
At the cross at the cross where I first saw the light
And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day


"Have Thine Own Way, Lord"
Have Thine own way, Lord
Thou art the Potter, I am the clay
Mold me and make me after Thy will
While I am waiting, yielded and still
Have Thine own way, Lord
Search me and try me, Master, today
Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now
As in Thy presence humbly I bow
Have Thine own way, Lord
Wounded and weary, help me, I pray
Power, all power, surely is Thine
Touch me and heal me, Savior divine
Have Thine own way, Lord
Hold o'er my being absolute sway
Fill with Thy Spirit 'till all shall see
Christ only, always, living in me


"Nasty Dan"
Nasty Dan was the meanest man I ever knew
He's stomp and scream and be real mean the whole day through
He'd frown a bunch he ate nails for lunch and he'd never laugh
He'd growl and yell and I hard tell that he never took a bath
Nasty Dan was a nasty man
Hard to understand that Nasty Dan
Now Nasty Dan was a nasty man the whole day long
He'd go where he could he'd try real good to make things go wrong
He'd jump for joy when a little boy would trip and fall
And the only words that he ever said were I don't like you at all
Nasty Dan was a nasty man
Hard to understand that Nasty Dan
Now a real interesting thing that I want you to know about is this here
Because it's the most important thing it concerns a girl and things like that
Now Nasty Pearl was a nasty girl that met Dan somehow
She said you like me rotten as can be let's get married now
So they went and they did and had a nasty kid
And I must confess that Dan pretty much leaves everyone alone now
And he doesn't bother anybody anymore cause he just lives in his nasty ol' house
With his nasty ol' wife and his nasty ol' kid in nasty happiness
Nasty Dan was a nasty man
Hard to understand that Nasty Dan


"One And One Makes Two"
Oh the number one is not my favorite number
Cause one means only me and there's no you
But one plus one you see makes two that's you and me
And it's more fun when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one makes two at least I'm pretty sure they do
Oh yes it's true one and one makes two
Now let me show you what I mean
Now you say you want to play upon a seesaw
You're all alone and you don't know what to do
Well just go and find a friend and sit him on the other end
You'll have more fun when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one
Now you say you want to play a game of baseball
And you look around and there's no one but you
Well just find someone you know and he will catch the ball you throw
You'll have more fun when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one
Now there's the best reason of all that I like to number two right here
Now everyone needs somebody to share with
To love and help and care for through and through
And there's no one that I've known who can share or love alone
It's a lot nicer when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one
I said it's true one and one makes two

"Little Magic Glasses"
I wish I had a pair of little magic glasses
That I could see the future just by lookin' through
Then I could know what road tomorrow's gonna take me down
And I could see if I'll be walkin' down that road with you
I would keep my little magic glasses hidden
I would let nobody else see what I see
And everyone would want to know how I can know what lies ahead
And they'll wonder when I say tomorrow I see you with me
But if I see into the future that I'm on the road alone
And where the way was sunny, now there's only rain
I'll put them in a box and seal it with a lock
And I'll never take my little magic glasses out again
I will put them in a box and seal it with a lock
And I'll never take my little magic glasses out again
And I'll never take my little magic glasses out again


"Miss Tara"
Where are you going Miss Tara, Miss Tara
Where are you going Miss Tara Joan
Yesterday when you played on the swing and the trampoline
You're already thinkin' of a life of your own
And I turned around twice and you're already gone
Who will you marry Miss Tara, Miss Tara
Who will you marry Miss Tara Joan
Will he have wealth and will he have fame
I'm sure too you're wonderin' just who he will be
Well, that's your decision, it's not up to me
I hope you'll be happy Miss Tara, Miss Tara
I hope you'll be happy Miss Tara Joan
And that you will stay with me till you're a woman
And wise to the world before you're off on your own
You're my last baby girl and I'll be so alone


"Dinosaur Song"
Dinosaurs lived a long time ago
They were terrible lizards, don't you know
Some ate plants and some ate meat
Some ate fish and some ate beasts
One was called Diplodocus
One was bigger than your school bus
One was called a Triceratops
Three horns to stop anything that hops
Now can't you just see yourself walking along
Leading your pet Trachadon or feeding your Brontosaurus Rex
Or scratching your Diplodocus neck
Or riding on a Stegosaurus back or swimming in a Brachiosaurus track
Oh what a time and oh what a fun
Play and tag with your Iguanondon
And if we had dinosaurs
Now could they get along with a horse and a cow
Well, I wish they hadn't become extinct
Dinosaurs would be nice pets and friends
To have around to run outside
And play with everyday, don't you think


"Tiger Whitehead"
Wild blackberries bloomin' in the thickest on the mountain
Sheep shire and water cress are growin' round the fountain
Where a big black bear is drinkin' lappin' water like a dog
Tiger Whitehead's in the bed sleepin' like a log
Tomorrow he'll see bear tracks seven intches wide
And by sundown he'll be bringin' in the hide
Pretty Sally Garland comin' down the mountain side
Where Tiger Whitehead's tryin' to nap a mill at the mill
She sits down on a bearskin and she says you'll be my man
I'll have me the best bearhunter in the hills
A wild child was Tiger Whitehead and they say he killed
Ninety
Once he left two bearcubs orphaned but he brought 'em right on home
And Sally nursed the two bearcubs upon her breast
Tiger now is eighty
And the bears he killed now numbered ninety
Some fellers trapped the bears but Tiger said just let him go
If he ain't running wild he won't be mine
But at  night when the wind howls cross eastern hills of Tennessee
And when the lightnin' flashes there's the strange thing that the people say they see
An old grey headed ghost runnin' through the mountains there
It's Tiger Whitehead after his one hundreth bear
Wild blackberries bloomin' in the thickest on the mountain
Sheep shire and water cress are growin' round the fountain
Where a big black bear is drinkin' lappin' water like a dog
Tiger Whitehead's in the bed sleepin' like a log
Tomorrow he'll see bear tracks seven intches wide
And by sundown he'll be bringin' in the hide


"Call Of The Wild"
Bayou bayou bayou bayou
Now here's a little tale about a flock of geese
Lookin' for a home and lookin' for a peace
But before they're safely in the southern sand
They gotta watch out for the critter called man
There's a goose and a gander and a goslin' child
Headin' on south at the call of the wild
Honk and holler as we go gonna see the Gulf of Mexico
Way up high don't fly low the long toms will get you from the old bayou
Well the wind from the north it chills you to the bone
And the call of the wild is callin' me come home
I'll lead my band of geese a marry trip we'll navigate that mighty Mississipp'
Honk and holler as we go
Bayou bayou bayou bayou
Honk and holler as we go
My pappy led this band of twenty
He made one fatal slip and he flew too low the long tom's got him from the old bayou
Honk and holler as we go


"Little Green Fountain"
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
Oh, the water is cool and the water is blue
A drink for me and a drink for you
Yes, the water is cool and the water is blue
A drink for me and a drink for you
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
Oh, the water is cool and the water is deep
Take off our shoes and cool our feet
Yes, the water is cool and the water is deep
Take off our shoes and cool our feet
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
Come along with me to the pasture now
We'll watch the wind blow on the cows
Come along with me to the pasture now
We'll watch the wind blow on the cows

"Old Shep"
When I was a lad
And old shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd play
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way
I remember the time at the old swimmin hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pull me out
As the years fast did roll
Old shep he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can do no more for him jim
With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at sheps faithful head
I just couldnt do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead
He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see
Old shep he has gone
Where the good doggies go
And no more with old shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven
Theres one thing I know
Old shep has a wonderful home


"The Timber Man"
Many, many years ago
When this land was young
A lot of our country was covered
By big tall beautiful trees
And men had to have the trees
To make wood, to build houses
Make furniture with, to make boats
Even to make paper with
So as more and more people came
More wood was needed
So more and more trees
Were cut down
And the man that lived in the forest
And cut down the trees
Was called the Timber man
Well, my world is green and dark and dumb
My home is in the loggin' camp
All week I cut down the mighty trees
Saturday I get to do as I please
I give the man more than his hire
And he'll never know it if I tire
Show me the toughest tree around
The Timber man will bring it down
Swing it hard, cut it clean
No halfway or in
Move when the axe is in my hand
Make way for the Timber man
Yeah, he was a mighty big tough man usually
That Timber man that lived in that forest
And cut down those big trees
Well, they say there's sawdust in my brain
And don't get caught out in the rain
I got stump water in my blood
The sweat from my brow turns the ground to mud
When the men don't know how to fell a tree
The one they'll come and ask is me
I'll mark my spot and I'll take my stand
The tree's gonna fall for the Timber man
Swing it hard, cut it clean
No halfway or in
Move when the axe is in my hand
Make way for the Timber man
And when they're cuttin' on a tree
And it's just about ready to fall
The man yells out timber, timber


"Let There Be Country"
Tom T Hall is forty now and so is Bobby Bare
Willie Nelson's gettin' grey and Faron Young don't care
But the young ones keep on coming on the old are slow to go
Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song
No one picks like Bill Monroe and don't George Jones sing great
I can tell that the people care by the people at my gate
Webb Pierce invites the tourists in and Ray keeps them away
Let there be country and let the country play
Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song
Ernest Tubb's got all of the soul he's had for all these years
Porter Wagoner's recitation still bring me to tears
And when they do play Kitty Wells you know she's still the Queen
Let there be country and keep the country green
Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song
Little Jimmy Dickens still sends shivers through the crowd
Mother Maybelle whispers now but the heart comes through real loud
Gene Autry don't sing no more good old Tex Ritter's gone
And somewhere downtown Nashville a young man just got off the bus
With a guitar in his hands a pocket full of songs
A lot of talent and a heart full of hope
And he's gonna be the next big country star and the country wheels roll on
Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song
Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song


"One Piece At A Time"
Well, I left Kentucky back in '49
An' went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on cadillacs
Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black
One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand
[CHORUS]
I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
Cause I'll have the only one there is a round
So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears
Now, I never considered myself a thief
GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all of the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home
Now, up to now my plan went all right
Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong
The transmission was a '53
And the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone
So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help with an A
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlight' was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on
The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got thru
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said
Honey, take me for a spin
So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
Cause to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds
[CHORUS]
I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
Cause I'll have the only one there is around
[Spoken]
Ugh
This is the COTTON MOUTH
In the PSYCHO
Huh, This is the COTTON MOUTH
And negatory on the cost of this mow
You might say I went right up to the factory
And picked it up, it's cheaper that way
Ugh


"In A Young Girl's Mind"
Hand me my guitar there's a song that I was singing
Back when I was young and I had a good time
Looking for love in the misty waters of the seas that roll in a young girl's mind
Only in shadows and lonely at night she turns to you softly you turn on the light
You use her abuse her and you know it ain't right to treat one who loves you so badly
When she's doing the best that she can you know she's doing the best that she can
Do you believe in dreams do you believe in dreamers
Hoping that you'll find what you're looking for
You don't have to worry cause there's a bright tomorrow
In the dreams that roll in a young girl's mind
Only in shadows
So hand me my guitar
Of the seas that roll in a young girl's mind


"Mountain Lady"
Mountain lady do you sit on your front porch in the cool of the day
Mountain lady did you think your kids would ever come back to stay
Mountain lady does the columbine still twine around your door
And did you ever get a rug
To cover the cracks where my diaper drug on your wooden floor
Oh you appalachian lady once i was your little baby
And you rocked me in your homemade rockin' chair
Since i heard the wild goose callin' i have done a lot of fallin'
Mountain lady someday i'll come to you there
Mountain lady does the country church bell ring on sunday morn
Mountain lady do you still wear that old apron ragged and torn
Mountain lady on winter nights before our old fireplace
As you look into the flame do you ever call my name and do you see my face
Oh you appalachian lady
Mountain lady


"Michigan City Howdy Do"
Well johnson van dyke grigsby was paroled in '89
He never walked on a carpet never tasted dinner wine
His old eyes were slowly fadin' as he walked out of the gate
And he breathed the first free air he'd breathed since 19
Howdy do michigan city you're sure pretty sight
But I know there's bigger citties and more excitin' nights
But I think your girls're pretty and I love your children too
Michigan city indiana howdy do michigan city indiana howdy do
Michigan city indiana howdy do
Filled with the joy of freedom he didn't know that he was old
Cause time don't really matter when it's bubblin' in your soul
Well I don't think he was bitter cause he sure had a smile
And down the streets of michigan city he walked his first free miles
Howdy do michigan city


"Sold Out Of Flagpoles"
I walked down past the courthouse square three blocks or maybe four
Run into my old friend there who runs a handy hardware store
I said mornin' Lon what's the good word
He said Abraham Lincoln Lone Ranger Mickey Mouse and I'm sold out of flagpoles
I popped the top off a soda pop laid a quarter on the bar
I said inflation is a dirty dog my payday sure ain't goin' far
Liberty said Lonnie E Pluribus Uni in God we trust and I'm sold out of flagpoles
I said hey Lonnie did you see Evel Knievel jumpin' on TV
Jumped 13 buses with his machine reckon he could jump 14
No doubt said Lonnie winners keep on winnin'
Even losers win sometimes and I'm sold out of flagpoles
Ain't this been a year I said for frost and blight and flood and drought
Twice as many tornados reckon it's all caused by fallout
No it's the season said Lonnie they change
Wind's gonna blow always did and I'm sold out of flagpoles
Hey what d'you think about the sheriff's daughter
Runnin' off with the preacher's son
The sheriff's wife had to hold him back from goin' after them with his gun
Boys and girls said Lonnie will get together
Everything's normal and I'm sold out of flagpoles
And I'm sold out of flagpoles sold out of flagpoles sold out of flagpoles


"Committed To Parkview"
There's a man across the hall who sits staring at the floor
He thinks he's Hank Williams
There's a girl in 203, who stops by to visit me
And she talks about her songs and the star that she should be
There are lots of special people staying in or passing through
And for one thing or another, committed to Parkview
There's a girl in 307, coming down on Thorazine
And a superstar's ex
There's a boy just down below me, who's the son of some well
He was brought in by his mother, 'cos his daddy's always gone
There's a bum from down on Broadway and then a few quite well
Who have withdrawn from the rat race and committed to Parkview
There's a girl who cries above me, loud enough to wake the dead
They don't know what she has taken that has scrambled up her head
There's a writer and a singer who has tried and tried and tried
They just brought him in this morning, an attempted suicide
There are those that never made it, those that did but now are through
Some came of their own good choosing: some committed to Parkview
They wake us about 6: 30, just before the morning meal
While they're taking blood pressure, they ask us how we feel
And I always say
Fantastic
And then they give me my injection and I go right back to sleep
And my days are kind of foggy and my nights are dreamy too
But they're taking good care of me: committed to Parkview


"Daughter Of A Railroad Man"
Leaving in a cloud of burning cinders cinders from a fire of love gone out
Never looking back when she's highbolling
She's the daughter of a railroam man no doubt
Waking in a new bed every morning breaking in a new heart every night
Up and running while the world is sleeping
She's the daughter of a railroam man alright
She is long and sleek and made for moving she's outward bound at any time she can
She won't be staying long in any station she's the daughter of a railroam man
Cries out in the night when she gets lonely you can bet she won't be lonely long
On down the line someone waits her arrival and the daughter of a railroad man is gone
She is long and sleek


"Love Has Lost Again"
I guess we're over and it's all been said before
But I still want you though there's no reason anymore
I can't remember when you and I began
It makes no difference cause love has lost again
If there's a reason we forgot it long ago
And if there's an answer it's one I'll never know
The price of giving I just don't understand
But it's collected and love has lost again
All that's left now is the closing of the door
It sounds so final but I don't listen anymore
It's not the last time that I'll break instead of bend
But for the moment love has lost again
It's not the last time that I'll break instead of bend
But for the moment love has lost again


"Go On Blues"
Go on blues go on lonesome
Get your dark clouds off of me
Go on blues go on troubles
Turn loose of me set me free
I've been down through that valley with you
Now I've found me somebody who loves me too
Go on blues go away from me
Go on by me go on blues
I've been down through that valley with you
Now I've found me somebody who loves me too
Go on blues go away from me
Go on by me go on blues
Yeah go on blues go on by me
Get away from me go on blues


"I Will Dance With You"
I sang your song before you ever came along but that don't mean I'll sing along
I've never waltzed the home sweet home but I will dance with you
I'd spread my wings before you ever learned to fly like flocks of wild geese in the sky
See one more shore before they die I will fly with you
With you I'll dream before we ever fall asleep the dreams you always hope to keep
And though they may fall to our feet I will dream with you
I'd drink your wine and taste the sweetness of your fine
And if I haven't aged with time before the days begin to twine I will age with you
I sang your song before you ever came along but that don't mean I'll sing along
I've never waltzed the home sweet home but I will dance with you


"The Last Gunfighter Ballad"
The old gunfighter stood on the porch
and stared into the sun
And relived all the old days
back when he was livin' by the gun
When deadly games of pride were played
and livin' was mistakes not made
And the thought of the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
The thought of the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
And it's always keep your back to the sun
And you can almost feel the weight of that gun
It's faster than snakes or a blink of the eye
And it's a time for all slow men to die
His eyes get squinty and he's straight as a log
and he empties his gun at the dirty dog
And he's hit by the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Hit by the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Now the burn of a bullet is only a scar
And he's back in his chair in front of a bar
And the streets are empty and the blood's all dried
The dead are dust and the whiskey's inside
So buy him a drink and lend him an ear
He's nobody's fool and he's the only one here
Who remembers the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Remembers the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Said I stood in that street before it was paved
I learned to shoot or be shot before I could shave
And I did it all for the money and the fame
Noble was nothing but feelin' no shame
And nothing was sacred but stayin' alive
And all that I learned from a Colt .45
Was to cuss the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Cuss the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Now he's just an old man that nobody believes
Says he's a gunfighter the last of this breed
And there's ghosts in the street seekin' revenge
Callin' him out to the lunatic fringe
He's out in the traffic now checking the sun
And he's killed by a car as he goes for his gun
So much for the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
So much for the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke


"Far Side Banks Of Jordan"
I believe my steps are growing wearier each day
Still I've got a journey on my mind
Lures of this old world have ceased to make me want to stay
and my one regret is leaving you behind
If it proves to be his will that I'm the first to go
And some how I've a feeling it will be
When it comes time to travel likewise don't feel lost
For I will be the first one that you'll see
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be waiting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming I will rise up with a shout
And come running through the shallow waters reaching for your hand
Through this life we've laboured hard to earn our meager fare
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes
I'll just rest here on this shore and turn my eyes away
And then you'll come then we'll see paradise


"Give It Away"
Well I woke up this morning I had something on my face
It was still there when I brushed my teeth still there when I shaved
I showed it to my neighbor and he broke into a grin I gave it away I gave it away
Smiles don't cost money give it away give it away
Maybe all you have is just a kind word you can say give it away give it away
I woke up this morning with a song in my heart
I hummed it all through coffee and it gave my day a start
I took my song to work with me and I sang it for my friend
I gave it away I gave it away
Yes Jesus loves me give it away give it away
Maybe all you have is just a kind word you can say give it away give it away
Don't think people do not care I know they care a lot
Don't be bashful of somebody give it all you've got
Understandin' means more than you ever thought it could to give it away give it away
Love someone sometime give it away give it away
Maybe all you have is just a kind word you can say give it away give it away
Give it away give it away


"You're So Close To Me"
You're so close to me your body and your soul're now a part of me
We are one now no one could ever know just what you are to me
You're so close to me your deepest darkest secrets all belong to me
I am you you are me you're so close to me
And in the morning I can look into your eyes and know your feelings
We can talk to one another without speeking
And if it's lovin' that you're gonna know it
Your sweet eyes show it every morning
You're so close to me your body and your soul're now a part of me
We are one now no one could ever know just what you are to me
You're so close to me your deepest darkest secrets all belong to me
I am you you are me you're so close to me
And in the evening I can feel your gentle softness without touchin' you
I don't need another thing I've got so much in you
And if it's lovin' that you're gonna give it
I'm gonna live it every evening
You're so close to me your body and your soul're now a part of me
We are one now no one could ever know just what you are to me
You're so close to me your deepest darkest secrets all belong to me
I am you you are me you're so close to me


"City Jail"
City jail city jail like an old scared dog I tuck my tail
Bow my head and not a careless word is said
Gotta sleep on the floor once more at city jail
Well I was hangin' round the bus station
Mindin' my own business like I always do
When I saw this waitress in this bus station cafe
And I thought I check out the action like I always do
I'd give her the bad eye and made a few choices personal comments
About what I thought mine and her possibilities could be for a team
When she called the badge on me
The badge grabbed me by the arm and he said
What are you doin' hangin' around here for
And I said for whatever's goin' around
City jail city jail
He said no what I mean is what are you doin'
Sayin' things like that to that lady
And I said what's that lady's doin' with purple hair
Well the badge said you're smart alec and I said no I ain't I'm just hungry
And he said you're actin' like a smart alec
And I said no that's how I act when I get hungry
City jail city jail
Well he put me outside in a dark corner
And before you could say hypocrite he hit me on the head
And I said oooh don't hit me on the head
I can't protect myself with the handcuffs on
Please don't hit me on the head then he hit me again he hit me again he hit me again
And I said oh oh oh oh oh please don't stand on my feet when you hit me
I break my ankles when I fall
City jail city jail
Well about that time they threw me in the wagon
And that waitress walked out with a sailor
I said hey you not you I'm talkin' to the purple people eater
Yes you lady quote you're the cause of it all unquote
Then she said to that sailor said get me away from that horrible man Harry
City jail city jail
Well as they hauled me away I said everybody have a nice evening
The Last Gunfighter Ballad


"Cindy I Love You"
We never really got right down to talking we couldn't seem to find the place or time
Distance in the miles between us made us kinda stranger
And it added to the distance already there between our minds
And Cindy I love you yes I love you yes I love you
And when I can't think of anything to say
Don't be readin' something in my mind that isn't there
Remember Cindy I love you anyway
I look at you and wonder what you're thinkin'
I'm sure you felt the same a time or two
We must both remember that true love sure costs us nothin'
You just told me your affection and I owed the same to you
And Cindy I love you
Remember Cindy I love you anyway


"Ballad Of Barbara"
In a southern town where I was born
That's where I got my education
I worked in the fields and I walked in the woods
And I wondered at creation
I recall the sun in a sky of blue
And the smell of green things growin'
And the seasons chang'd and I lived each day
Just the way the wind was blowin'
Then I heard of a cultured city life
Breath takin' lofty steeples
And the day I called myself a man
I left my land and my people
And I rambled north and I rambled east
And I tested and I tasted
And a girl or two, took me round and round
But they always left me wasted
In a world that's all concrete and steel
With nothin' green ever growin'
Where the buildings hide the risin' sun
And they blocked the free winds from blowin
Where you sleep all day and you wake all night
To a world of drink and laughter
I met that girl that I was sure would be
The one that I was after
In a soft blue gown and formal tux
Beneath that lofty steeple
He said
Do you Barbara, take this man
Will you be one of his people
And she said
I will
and she said
I do
And the world looked mighty pretty
And we lived in a fancy downtown flat
Cause she loved the noisy city
But the days grew cold beneath a yellow sky
And I longed for green things growin'
And the thoughts of home and the people there
But she'd not agreed to goin'
Then her hazel eyes turned away from me
With a look that wasn't pretty
And she turned into concrete and steel
And she said
I'll take the city
Now the cars go by on the interstate
And my pack is on my shoulder
But I'm goin' home, where I belong
Much wiser now and older


"That Silver Haired Daddy Of Mine"
In a vine covered
Shack in the mountains
Bravely fighting
The battle of time
There's a dear one
Who's wept
Through life's sorrows
It's that silver
Haired daddy of mine
If I could recall
All the heartaches
Dear ole daddy
I've caused you to bear
If I could erase
Those lines from your face
And bring back
The gold to your hair
If God would but
Grant me the power
Just to turn back
The pages of time
I would give all
I own just to put a tone
To that silver
Haired daddy of mine
If I could recall
All the heartaches
Dear ole daddy
I've caused you to bear
If I could erase
Those lines from your face
And bring back
The gold to your hair
If God would but
Grant me the power
Just to turn back
The pages of time
I would give all
I own just to put a tone
To that silver
Haired daddy of mine
The Last Gunfighter Ballad


"Hit The Road And Go"
I woke up this afternoon, looked into your eyes
And somethin' was as wrong as if the sun forgot to rise
I picked up a road map and I checked a few good places that I know
And if you're no longer givin', I believe I'll hit the road and go
I just got the feelin' that the fire was burnin' out
Cause the air was turnin' colder every time you came about
And a flame won't take a fannin' if the last reserve of love is runnin' low
So since I've gotta button up, I believe I'll hit the road and go
Country road 6
Life out of the interstate is very much alive
There's magic in the mountains and music in the valleys down below
And my song ain't through playin' yet so I believe I'll hit the road and go
Good morning to you sunshine, good morning to you rain
The windshield wiper's rhythm keeps me singin' down the pain
Today I'm gonna miss you less if I miss you at all
You'll never know, you'll never know
This rambler has cut all the ties and pulled up stakes to hit the road and go
This rambler has cut all the ties and pulled up stakes to hit the road and go


"If It Wasn't For The Wabash River"
Fish ain't bitin' but I don't really care and don't hurry
Like that Wabash River there I'd be drinkin'
Or laying dead somewhere if it wasn't for the Wabash River
If it wasn't for the Wabash River and this willow tree and my pole and a line
I'd be goin' crazy as an Indiana cyclone
Drownin' memories of her and cryin' cryin' cryin'
If it wasn't for the Wabash River I'd be goin' out off my mind
It's so peaceful sittin' here beneath my tree Lord I need her
Like she often needed me life ain't worth it
Just as far as I can see if it wasn't for the Wabash River
If it wasn't for the Wabash River
[Rambler]
Look out man alive
Fifty
And you go fifty
[Fisherman]
Man I must be nuts I just got back from California
All that time out there chasin' after her
[Rambler]
Well she must be worth a round trip
[Fisherman]
Worth it
You know there was a time I'd run naked through the snow just to touch that woman
[Rambler]
But you wouldn't now ha
[Fisherman]
Where we're at anyway
[Rambler]
I don't know I believe that's the Platte River you want to go fishin' again
[Fisherman]
I had enough fishin'
[Rambler]
It's still a long way to California you know
[Fisherman]
You know I just might change my mind before we get there
[Rambler]
You sound like you got no control over whether you go or not
[Fisherman]
That's just it what is it about a woman that makes such a dummy out of a man
She was wild even when she was lovin' me man
I knew tomorrow it'd likely be somebody else she would be with
But you know just that idea that the next day she could be lovin' me again
That's what kept me on her tail chasin' after all the time
She really was poison but I guess it was good poison
Look at me here I go again hopin' for another dose of that sweet poison she had man
Did you ever have a woman like that
[Rambler]
Yeah I guess I have
[Fisherman]
You know what I mean
[Rambler]
My woman's a lady
[Fisherman]
A lady
[Rambler]
A lady will give you the best lovin' you ever had
I don't care what you had in California but even a lady's love can burn out though
But what I mean is a good woman a kind sweet considerate understandin' woman
That likes to be treated like she treats you
And if that ain't bull the better she gives love the more she wants to give
I know what I'm talkin' about a lady
Lovin's better is a lovin' heart's goin' to give another and a lady loves to give
Mine did for a little while


"Lady"
Lady your arms're always warm and your bed was always ready when I came
Lady in the middle of the night
You would open up when you'd hear me call your name
And you were always there to see the turning of my key
And your laughing voice to me was like a song
Lady your spirit's sweet and free it's hanging on with me now that I'm gone
Lady you spoke softly and kind and you never had a word to criticize
Lady you know I love you so even more than I ever let you be alive
And day or night I knew that I could bring it all to you
And if I was wrong you'd never put me down
Lady so much I could say but I can't find the way to write it down
Can't find the way to write it down
The days and the miles roll by
In Denver the Rambler and the Fisherman are tired of the road
And ready for whatever the city and the night have to offer
They check into a cheap hotel and go right to the bar downstairs
It's Saturday night and the city's alive
They've been in the bar four hours now and it's nearly closin' time
[Fisherman]
Hey give me another Coors how about you Angie
[Bargirl 1]
I don't like beer
[Fisherman]
Wow man I believe the little lady here wants champagne
[Bargirl 2]
Hey yeah could I have champagne
[Rambler]
Do you think we're a couple of bankers here or somethin'
[Bargirl 1]
I like that
[Fisherman]
Abracadabra abracadabra Coors you're no longer Coors you're champagne
[Rambler]
Man I've had enough of this
[Bargirl 1]
Hey where are you goin'
[Rambler]
Good night

Hey you're not goin' are you you were buyin' me a drink
[Fisherman]
Hey give me another Coors
[Bargirl 1]
But I don't like beer
[Fisherman]
That ain't beer honey that's Coors
[Rambler]
Well the barman's right
Beer the bar girls too much beer I must be seein' things
I saw you sittin' on a barstool lady and I looked up and you were gone
You didn't like beer either did you lady liked champagne neither did you lady
In Denver Colorado fancy town for a fancy lady like you
Hey maybe she's out there somewhere hey lady hahaha
Hey I ran maybe she ran maybe I did see her downstairs
Maybe she's drownin' her blues like I did
Hey maybe I did see her down there havin' a ball somewhere comin' up to me
Yeah maybe she'll be comin' yeah maybe she'll be comin'


"After The Ball"
I hear people laughing on the corner by the square
The neon flickers on my wall and I know you're out there
I've been in here a listening for your footsteps down the hall
And I'll be waiting for you after the ball
After the ball is over, after the ball
If you cannot stand I got a place for you to fall
The blinds are drawn and I have turned the clock
I'll be waiting for you after the ball
Loving you is a sweet addiction I need only you
Just as long as you come back we'll do what you want to
Give the night your laughter, but I'll have you after all
I'll be waiting for you after the ball
After the ball is over, after the ball
If you cannot stand I got a place for you to fall
The blinds are drawn and I have turned the clock
I'll be waiting for you after the ball


"No Earthly Good"
Come hear me good brothers, come here one and all
Don't brag about standing or you'll surely fall
You're shinin' your light and shine it you should
But you're so heavenly minded you're no earthly good
No earthly good you are no earthly good
You're so heavenly minded you're no earthly good
You're shinin' your light yes and shine it you should
You're so heavenly minded and you're no earthly good
Come hear me good sisters you're salt of the earth
If your salt isn't salted then what is it worth
You could give someone a cool drink if you would
You're so heavenly minded and you're no earthly good
No earthly good you are no earthly good
You're so heavenly minded you're no earthly good
You could give someone a cool drink if you would
You're so heavenly minded and you're no earthly good
If you're holdin' heaven then spread it around
There are hungry hands reaching up here from the ground
Move over and share the high ground where you stood
So heavenly minded you're no earthly good
No earthly good you are no earthly good
You're so heavenly minded you're no earthly good
Move over and share the high ground where you stood
So heavenly minded and you're no earthly good
No earthly good


"A Wednesday Car"
The assembly line is runnin' slow on Monday
They've been livin' it up and layin' up Saturday and Sunday
On Tuesday they're about to come around
But they still feel bad and they're kinda down
And mad cause they've got four more day before the weekend rolls around
On Wednesday they're feelin' fine again
And they're workin' like a dog and diggin' in
Tryin' to do everything they should puttin' 'em cars together good
And I got me a car that was made on Wednesday on Wednesday
If you're gonna boy yourself a new car
You just better hope you're lucky enough to get one made on Wednesday
On Thursday the weekend is in sight
And they're in a hurry and they don't do nothing right
Friday is the worst day of the week that's the day they make lemons dogs and freaks
If your car was made on Friday friend you'll soon be in the creek
Cause it's payday and the loafin' has begun
Lord them Friday cars just hope you don't get one
Monday Tuesday Thursday and Friday
Are all bad days and the only try day is Wednesday
And my car was made on Wednesday on Wednesday
If your car wasn't made on Wednesday I'd advise you not to even leave home any


"My Cowboy's Last Ride"
The cowboy's lady is cryin' tonight cause the cowboy is out on the range
Runnin' and ramblin' and chasin' some stray and good cowboys don't ever change
I tried to hold him in the home corral but the grasses were greener outside
So I'm gonna sit here in front of this door
And I've loaded up my cowboy's fourty
When the smoke clears there'll be a new brand on his eyes
This is my cowboy's last ride
Oh I hate to see him go but I won't be stayin' home cryin'
I hate to watch him die but this is my cowboy's last ride
Cowboy remembers the old trails we rode and he's back in the saddle tonight
This time I'm lettin' the homefires burn out and I'm leavin' when I blow out his light
Cause I still remember good waterin' holes and the places that are open and wide
And I have decied he won't put me down a filly should be free for horsin' around
And I will no longer be hobbled and tied this is my cowboy's last ride
Oh I hate to see him go but I won't be stayin' home cryin'
I hate to watch him die but this is my cowboy's last ride


"Calilou"
Well I'm finally goin' back to Louisiana
Runnin' and thumbin' all the way
That started out way out in California
I been makin' bout five hundred miles a day
I covered all the beaches on the west coast
From Mexico Crason City Bay
But Calilou was not in California
That's where her daddy came from by the way
And by the way her mother was a cajun
She came from New Orleans I've heard her say
And it's just like a girl to wanna see her mama
So I might find her there along the way
Calilou Calilou well they should have call you restless
Well they should have call you drifter
Yeah they should have call you trouble instead of Calilou
I reacall the first time that I saw her
I picked her up near Phoenix in my car
Just another beauty seekin' fame and fortune
And I told her if she should be a movie star
The next time I saw her was Tucumcari
She served my bowl of chili with a smile
I said it's been a year since I last saw you
Wonder how'd you like to share a few good miles
Well the justice of the peace was very sleepy
I held her in my arms a whole night long
I whispered words like settle down and family
And when I woke up my Calilou was gone
Calilou Calilou well they should have call you restless
Well they should have call you drifter
Yeah they should have call you trouble instead of Calilou
Calilou Calilou well they should have call you restless
Well they should have call you drifter
Yeah they should have call you trouble instead of Calilou
It's a long way to New Orleans
Well I got plenty of time
Me too you know it's lot of fun just seein' what the next day has to offer
You never know what round the next bend
Or what we're gonna find either
Do you know what I just wonder how long a man has to look before he finds himself
I just got the feelin' that the fire was burnin' out
Cause the air was turnin' colder every time you came about
And a flame won't take a fannin' if the last reserve of love is runnin' low
So since I've gotta button up I believe I'll hit the road and go
Country road 6
Life out of the interstate is very much alive
There's magic in the mountains and music in the valleys down below
And my song ain't through playin' yet so I believe I'll hit the road and go


"I Would Like To See You Again"
I was sittin' here thinking about old times some old times some old friends
And suddenly it crossed my mind that I would like to see you again
Remember how we used to walk and talk walk and talk holding hands
Said we loved each other I recall made a lot of future plans
But the years have come and gone and a whole lot has happened since then
But tonight babe your memory's awfully strong on my mind
And I would like to see you again
It's funny how an old flame comes back come on back make you blue
But I just saw a picture of a railroad track and some old shack and me and you
Guess I'd better straighten out my mind straighten it out go to bed
And pray that I don't dream about old times some old times gone and dead
But the years have come and gone


"Lately"
Lately I've been thinking that you don't love me at all
Lately I've been readin' and the writin' on the wall
Is sayin' looks like you'll be going and I've no sure way of knowing
But somehow that's what I've been thinking lately
Lately you've been saying things that I don't understand
Lately you look through me as if I'm another man
Instead of your old one and only I'm beginnin' to get lonely
I've been feeling you'll be leaving lately
You might as well just stop it now cause I already know
You wouldn't hurt me less if you just go ahead and go
You know your heart's already gone so you might as well go on
Things have not been working for us lately things have not been working for us lately


"I Wish I Was Crazy Again"
I met an old friend this morning
And I stopped him and called him by name
I said
The years haven't changed you
But he said
Good Lord, how you've changed
So we stood there and talked on the corner
And remembered the good times we had
Then he asked if we're happy together
And I only smiled and I said
Yes, she keeps me off the streets
And she keeps me out of trouble
Sometimes at night, Lord, when I hear the wind
I wish I was crazy again, yes, I wish I was crazy again
Then we stopped in at a tavern
We had us a round or two
We called ourselves old desperado's, old desperado's
As old friends are likely to do
We sat for a while and remembered
Then he said
Let's have just one more
I said
I'd sure like to join you
But best be goin' on home
Yes, she keeps me off the streets
She keeps me off the streets


"Who's Gene Autry"
Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
Back in the saddle again
My little boy said
Daddy, who's Gene Autry
His old movie was comin' on TV
And I said
Let me tell you about him, son
And I took him upon my knee
Why, when I was a little boy about your size
And just about every Saturday night
When I could scrape up a dime for the movies
And when my Daddy said alright
I'd be right downtown at the picture show
Like everybody else that could
To see a handsome man
On a big fine stallion goin' about, doin' good
Singin'
Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
Put him back in the saddle again
Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way
Back in the saddle again
Well, he could ride his horse and play his guitar
And sing all at the same time
And I was ridin' right along there beside him
On that broomstick pony of mine
And you know his pistol never ran out of bullets
When the bad guys had to be stopped
And somehow his bullets never drew any blood
But the bad guys dropped when he shot
Yeah, old Gene was an image of justice
And goodness and purity
And in the eyes of a poor, little country boy
He made the world look better to me
Singin'
Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
Put him back in the saddle again
Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way
Back in the saddle again
And you know the way
He rescued the rancher's daughter
He'd sent a thrill right up the aisle
And the endin' would always send us home
With a good victorious smile
Now you ask me, 'Who's Gene Autry
Well, son, go ahead and watch the show
And then ride off into the sunset with him
Like I did forty years ago
Singin'
Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
Put him back in the saddle again
Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way
Back in the saddle again


"Hurt So Bad"
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way


"I Don't Think I Could Take You Back Again"
Now you don't have to worry about me babe
Just hook 'em up and head on out to the places where you've been
Go ahead and fly like an eagle in the sky
And when you land you'll find I'm still your friend
But I don't think I could take you back again
Ain't no need to bother about me babe
Someone will come along and she will take me by the hand
Together we will walk where the grass is green and new
And I'll even think about you now and then
But I don't think I could take you back again
Hey where you going you can't get there without me so goodbye go on goodbye
And remember though I'm setting you free I won't cry cry cry
I've seen you toss and turning in your sleep babe
Now your dreambags're packed you've got your ticket in your hand
When you love someone you want what's best for them
That's how it is and that's how it's always been
And I don't think I could take you back again
Hey where you going


"Abner Brown"
Every town has its town bum
I guess ours had one
Here's a song about him, I remember him fondly
Well his name was Abner Brown
I knew an old drunk named Abner Brown
And nobody knew when he came to town
But he spread good will to his fellow men
And they let him sleep in the cotton gin
He could drink more brew than an army could
But he had more friends and he did more good
Than a lot of fine fancy people in our town
So they tolerated Abner Brown
And all us kids were on his side
Cause he told us tales till our eyes grew wide
And he made us feel bout ten feet tall
Cause he had no kids but he claimed us all
And after school and on weekends
You could find me down at the cotton gin
The truest friend that I ever found was
A good old drunk named Abner Brown
Abner Brown, I wish that I could see you once again
I believe that you'd stack up with all the mighty men
I've met and known in all the low
And higher places that I've been
Thinking of you picks me up when I'm feeling down
I thank the Lord for making Abner Brown
Lord take me back to the cotton land
To Arkansas take me home again
Let me be the boy that I once have been
Let me walk that road to the cotton gin
He's probably dead many years ago
And gone the way that old drunks go
But I'd still like to sit me down
Talk to my old friend, Abner Brown
Abner Brown, I wish
I thank the Lord for making Abner Brown


"After Taxes"
I feel so good come payday
I think of all the things I'm gonna
Buy when I pick up my pay
Don't you know, but then they hand me
That little brown envelope
I peep inside, Lord I lose all hope
Cause from those total wages earned
Down to that net amount that's due
I feel the painful sense of loss between the two
There goes that bracelet for her arm
There goes that new fence for my farm
There goes that brand new Pontiac
There goes the shirt right off my back
You can dream about a honeymoon for two
You can dream but that's about all you can do
Cause by the time old Uncle Sam gets through with you
You can buy her a pair of hose
A little powder for her nose
And take her down to Sloppy Joe's for beer
And stew them are the facts after tax
You can dream about vacation in the sun
You can dream but you can't never have you one
Cause by the time your good old Uncle Sam gets done
You've got just enough for gas
To see them city limits pass
And if you get back home fourth class
I'd say you won
There goes that bracelet for her arm
There goes that new fence for my farm
Send back that short wave radio cancel that trip to Mexico
Forget that brand new Pontiac
There goes the shirt right off my back
